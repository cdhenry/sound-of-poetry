He received an undergraduate degree in Basque philology from the University of the Basque Country.\nHis first collection of poetry, Bitartean heldu eskutik (2001), won Spain\u2019s Premio de la Critica. Elizabeth Macklin\u2019s English translation, Meanwhile Take My Hand (2007), was a finalist for the 2008 PEN Award for Poetry in Translation. Uribe\u2019s imagery is rooted in his Basque homeland, with themes ranging from romantic love to technology, history to travel. A reviewer for the Los Angeles Times Book Review praised the translation, noting, \u201cThe poems are each a beacon of light and memory, surrounded by conflict, explosion and interruption.\u201d\nIn addition to his poetry, Uribe has published essays, fiction, comics, and children\u2019s literature. He has worked as a translator, scriptwriter, instructor, and columnist for the Basque-language daily newspaper Berria. His piece for theater, Ekidazu, has been produced by the groups Kukubiltxo and Oskorri. Uribe collaborated with poet-translator Elizabeth Macklin, singer-songwriter Mikel Urdangarin, and musicians Bingen Mendizabal and Rafa Rueda on a multimedia project integrating poetry, prose, video, music, and oral history, which was documented in the CD-books Zaharregia, txikiegia agian (2003)\u00a0and\u00a0Bar Puerto (2001).\nIn 2017 Uribe was selected for the International Writers Program\u00a0in Iowa City.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Spain"]}}
