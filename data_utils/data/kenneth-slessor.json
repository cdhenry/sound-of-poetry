He wrote articles for the Sydney Sun starting at age 19, and he began publishing his poetry in the 1920s in Vision. His antimodernist, anti-intellectual early poems, collected in Earth-Visitors (1926), illustrate\u00a0a stylistic movement from Australian bush poetry to a Nietzschean unrestrained joy in beauty and life.\nIn his later works, Canberra (1966) and Life at the Cross\u00a0(1965), Slessor applied technical innovations to Australian themes. He utilized unconventional rhyme, lyrical experiments, rich imagery, and dramatic techniques. His poetry vented verbal energy mollified by the use of irony. Though melancholy and disillusion were characteristic of Slessor\u2019s poetry, individualism and a zest for life were also prominent features. His favorite themes included time, the sea, and reflections on memory; his message was one of romantic renunciation.\nAmong Slessor\u2019s most well-known poems are \u201cBeach Burial,\u201d written for Australian World War II troops, and \u201cFive Bells,\u201d which responds to the death of his friend Joe Lynch, who drowned in Sydney Harbor.\nSlessor died in Sydney, Australia, on July 30, 1971.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Australia"], "School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
