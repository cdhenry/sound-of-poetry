In a 2010 interview for Lemon Hound, Place has quoted Marcel Duchamp, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you see that is art, art is the gap.\u201d In a 2013 Tarpaulin Sky interview with Eireene Nealand, Place stated, \u201cThe law, like poetry, engages in grossly overt fashion with the transformation of the real into the symbolic via a kind of Eucharistic metamorphosis. Worked, like some might argue the spiritus sanctus works, by way of words. Words, as many have noted, never quite fit. But they will do.\u201d \u00a0 Place is the author of Dies: A Sentence (2005), a novel-in-verse written as a single 117-page sentence; La Medusa (2008); the Tragod\u00eda trilogy, composed of legal documents; and Boycott (2013). She coauthored Notes on Conceptualisms (2009) with Robert Fitterman. She is also the author of the legal analysis The Guilt Project: Rape, Morality, and Law (2010). Place coedited I\u2019ll Drown My Book: Conceptual Writing by Women with Caroline Bergvall, Laynie Browne, and Teresa Carmody and translated Frank Smith\u2019s Guantanamo (2013). \u00a0 Place codirects Les Figues Press and divides her time between Los Angeles and New York City.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {}}
