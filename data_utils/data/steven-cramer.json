His collections of poetry include\u00a0The Eye that Desires to Look Upward\u00a0(1987); The World Book\u00a0(1992); Dialogue for the Left and Right Hand\u00a0(1997);\u00a0Goodbye to the Orchard\u00a0(2004), which won the 2005 Sheila Motton Prize and was named an Honor Book in Poetry by the Massachusetts Center for the Book;\u00a0Clangings\u00a0(2012), a book-length sequence that deals with psycho-linguistics; and Listen (2020).\r\n\u00a0\nPraising Dialogue for the Left and Right Hand, Alan Shapiro noted that the poems \u201ccelebrate those privileged, life-sustaining, yet evanescent moments of agreement between self and world, word and thing, one person and another; but they do so by reminding us of the destructive forces in us and around us that menace or impede these moments.\u201d Cramer's poetry is known for its lucid, smart portrayal of sentiment. In Harvard Review, Shrode Hargis wrote that Goodbye to the Orchard \u201cprovides page after page of graceful inquisition and controlled musicality.\u201d While frequently autobiographical, Cramer's work\u2014as in\u00a0Clangings\u2014can also be formally inventive and estranging. According to David Rivard,\u00a0Clangings \u201cbalances perfectly on the knife-edge of improvisation and necessity.\u201d After Clanging\u2019s \u201cdive into mental disturbance by way of a persona\u201d (Martha Collins), Listen represents a return to the lyric, but with a greater openness to the irrational.\u00a0 Kevin Prufer calls Listen \u201ca marvelous book by a poet in top form.\u201d\nSteven Cramer has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and twice from the Massachusetts Cultural Council. In addition to journals such as AGNI, Field, the Kenyon Review, the Paris Review, and Poetry magazine, Cramer\u2019s work has been included in the anthologies The Autumn House Anthology of Contemporary American Poetry, first and second editions (2005, 2011); A Joyful Noise: An Anthology of American Spiritual Poetry (2007); Living in Storms: Contemporary Poetry and the Moods of Manic-Depression (2008); The Plume Anthology of Poetry, 2014; The POETRY Anthology 1912-2002; and Villanelles (2012). Cramer has also written reviews and essays for AGNI, Atlantic Unbound, Harvard Review, Boston Review, Ploughshares, and Poetry. A former editor at the Atlantic Monthly,\u00a0he founded and currently teaches in the Low-Residency MFA Program in Creative Writing at Lesley University, and lives in Lexington, Massachusetts, with his family.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
