He described his upbringing as small-town and working-class. His earliest exposure to literature came from his mother and older brother, who read aloud to him when he was a child. Later, when he attended school, his writing was influenced by the works of W.S. Graham, Philip Larkin, Thom Gunn, T.S. Eliot, and Sylvia Plath, and by song lyrics.\n\r\nRoddy Lumsden\u2019s poetry collections include So Glad I'm Me (2017), Melt and Solve (2015), Not All Honey (2014), Terrific Melancholy (2011), Third Wish Wasted (2009); Vitamin Q (2005), Mischief Night: New and Selected Poems (2004), Roddy Lumsden Is Dead (2003), The Book of Love (2000), and Yeah, Yeah, Yeah (1997). His work is marked by an attention to formal traditions and a voice both streetwise and regretful. Matthew Smith, reviewing Mischief Night: New and Selected Poems (2004), noted that \u201cthe ongoing affair between hedonism and mortality in Lumsden\u2019s poetry is as much context as a subject for his work.\u201d He also observed his \u201cflair for formal roguery\u201d and commented that \u201calthough the verse is hopping with linguistic antics, the foci of the language are music and rhetoric.\u201d His last book, So Glad I'm Me (2017), was shortlisted for the T.S. Eliot Prize.\n\r\nLumsden received an Eric Gregory Award and was Writing Fellow for the City of Aberdeen. Lumsden worked as a freelance writer, editor, teacher, and writer of puzzles and quizzes for newspapers. He edited Identity Parade (2010), an anthology of recent UK / Irish poetry. In 1999 he cowrote The Message, a book on poetry and music. He also composed a poem, \u201cBloom,\u201d on the set of \u201cFlowers for Kate\u201d\u2014a photo shoot of the model Kate Moss for V magazine. From 2010 to 2013 he served as poetry editor of Salt Publishing, for whom he was also the Series Editor of The Best British Poetry anthologies.\nLumsden lived in London, where he taught at The Poetry School and and served as organiser and host of the monthly reading series BroadCast. He died in early 2020.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Scotland"]}}
