Reviewer Molly Sutton Kiefer writes, \u201cValerie Wetlaufer\u2019s debut collection Mysterious Acts by My People is a flirtation, seeped in desire and violence, the two often tangled with one another in a fraught tryst. ... somehow, the bulk of the poems ring as absolute truths, while donning personas and flights of fancy.\u201d \u00a0 Wetlaufer is the editor of Adrienne: A Poetry Journal of Queer Women, and her writing has appeared in Word Riot, Codex Journal, Drunken Boat, and elsewhere. In 2010, she received a fellowship to attend the Lambda Literary Foundation Emerging Writers Retreat.
