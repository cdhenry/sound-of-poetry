Since 1975, his work\u2014both poetry and criticism\u2014has regularly appeared in major journals and publications such as the New Yorker, the New York Times, the Paris Review, Poetry, and the New Criterion. He is the author of numerous books of poetry, including Sad-Faced Men (1982), Sullen Weedy Lakes (1988), Vain Empires (1998), Poetry and the Age (2000), Strange Flesh (2008), Madame X (2012), and Rift of Light (2017).\n\r\nLogan\u2019s poetry is distinguished by its intricate formal structures; his work frequently uses traditional forms such as the sonnet, and rhyme and meter schemes, to explore concepts of truth and art as well as various ironies of the human condition. G.E. Murray, in a review for Chicago Tribune Books, characterized Logan\u2019s work as \u201ca poetry of terse and tense structures of language attempting to comprehend complex physical and emotional interweavings of events, place, and person.\u201d Logan\u2019s poems draw on landscape, history, art, and English literary history, and his work has been praised for its erudition and scope. Richard Tillinghast, writing in the New York Times Book Review, declared that \u201cwhen he manages to avoid obscurity, Mr. Logan writes with vigor, almost classical restraint and a fine sense of musicality.\u201d Bruce Bennett in the New York Times Book Review lauded Logan\u2019s ability to use \u201csaving devices of wit\u201d in various poems to relieve the dark tone of the collections. Reviewers have elsewhere characterized Logan\u2019s \u201cdark tone\u201d as acerbic, severe, or even spiky. Yet his short, tensile poems are also praised for their insightfulness. According to Publisher\u2019s Weekly, Logan \u201cbrings, at his best, a sense of human life, of answers ignored and potential squandered. Logan's acrid wisdom offers a sense that he has seen through the facades we perversely maintain.\u201d\n\r\nIn early collections such as Sad-Faced Men, Moorhen (1984), and Sullen Weedy Lakes, Logan developed what one reviewer described as a \u201ctough-minded, authentically adventurous formalism.\u201d Vain Empires (2000) extended that project, and Logan\u2019s recent work has taken on such morally complex subjects as empire and faith, rendering them in elegant, accomplished, and frequently difficult, prosody. Michael Scharf commented in a Poetry magazine review of Hill\u2019s book Night Battle (1999): \u201cWilliam Logan is our Geoffrey Hill: cranky, gifted, and concerned with our unavoidable entanglements with the past\u2019s moral bequests \u2026 this formidable volume takes its place beside Logan\u2019s three prior excursions in to textual unknowns, venturing beyond the alluring dazzle of empire.\u201d\n\r\nYet Logan once told Contemporary Authors: \u201cI\u2019ve never considered my poetry difficult, a word that implies not just impaction, but giddy or indolent pig-headedness. If my poetry seems overly difficult to others, contemporary poetry doesn\u2019t seem difficult enough to me. Perhaps to a slightly greater degree than is now usual, I believe that emotion must lie in language\u2014in the complication and redolence of language\u2014and not in personal incident or the raillery of confession.\u201d\n\r\nLogan has also garnered considerable praise, and notoriety, for his work as a critic. Slate magazine declared him \u201cthe most hated man in American poetry,\u201d alleging that \u201cthe outrageous simile is Logan's weapon of choice, but he\u2019s got an arsenal.\u201d Logan\u2019s books of criticism include All the Rage: Prose on Poetry 1976-1992 (1998), Reputations of the Tongue: Essays on Poets and Poetry (1999), Desperate Measures (2002), The Undiscovered Country: Poetry in the Age of Tin (2005), Our Savage Art (2005), Guilty Knowledge, Guilty Pleasure (2012), and Dickinson\u2019s Nerves, Frost\u2019s Woods: Poetry in the Shadow of the Past (2018). Though Logan has drawn some ire for his criticism\u2019s reliance on exaggerated and at times seemingly personal attacks, few of either his admirers or detractors doubt his incisiveness or vigor. Discussing Reputations of the Tongue: Essays on Poets and Poetry in Library Journal, Ellen Sullivan noted the writer\u2019s typical \u201ccandor and biting wit\u201d and added that Logan shows \u201cfearless honesty\u201d in his analyses. And Christian Wiman declared in a Poetry magazine review: \u201cWilliam Logan is the best practical critic around. I sometimes disagree with his judgements fiercely, but that I so fiercely disagree, that his prose provokes such a response, is what makes him the best. Most criticism is like most poetry: it simply leaves you indifferent. I\u2019ve seen Logan\u2019s name bring bile to the lips of the gentlest spirits \u2026 For breadth of intelligence, an incisive style, and pure passion, I don\u2019t think he can be matched.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nWilliam Logan is a professor of English at the University of Florida, where he teaches in the MFA program. His numerous honors and awards include a Lavan Award from the Academy of American Poets, the J. Howard and Barbara M.J. Wood Prize, the Amy Lowell Poetry Travelling Scholarship, and the inaugural Randall Jarrell Award in Criticism; he is also the recipient of grants and fellowships from the Ingram Merrill Foundation, the Florida Arts Commission, and the National Endowment for the Arts. Logan has received the National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism, as well as their Citation for Excellence in Reviewing.\n", "attrs": {}}
