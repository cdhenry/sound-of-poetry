He has won numerous prestigious literary awards including the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, two Pushcart Prizes, and the Academy of Arts and Letters Award, and has twice been nominated for the National Book Award. The author of ten acclaimed novels, Wagoner\u2019s fiction has been awarded the Sherwood Anderson Foundation Award. Professor emeritus at the University of Washington, Wagoner enjoys an excellent reputation as both a writer and a teacher of writing. He was selected to serve as chancellor of the Academy of American Poets in 1978, replacing Robert Lowell, and was the editor of Poetry Northwest until 2002.\n\r\nBorn in Ohio and raised in Indiana, Midwesterner Wagoner was initially influenced by family ties, ethnic neighborhoods, industrial production and pollution, and the urban environment. His move to the Pacific Northwest in 1954, at Roethke\u2019s urging, changed both his outlook and his poetry. Writing in the Contemporary Authors Autobiography Series, Wagoner recalls: \u201cwhen I drove down out of the Cascades and saw the region that was to become my home territory for the next thirty years, my extreme uneasiness turned into awe. I had never seen or imagined such greenness, such a promise of healing growth. Everything I saw appeared to be living ancestral forms of the dead earth where I\u2019d tried to grow up.\u201d Wagoner\u2019s poetry often mourns the loss of a natural, fertile wilderness, though David K. Robinson, writing in Contemporary Poetry, described the themes of \u201csurvival, anger at those who violate the natural world\u201d and \u201ca Chaucerian delight in human oddity\u201d at work in the poems as well. Critics have also praised Wagoner\u2019s poetry for its crisp descriptive detail and metaphorical bent. However, Paul Breslin in the New York Times Book Review pronounced David Wagoner to be \u201cpredominantly a nature poet\u2026as Frost and Roethke were nature poets.\u201d\n\r\nWagoner\u2019s first books, including Dry Sun, Dry Wind (1953), A Place to Stand (1958), and Poems (1959), demonstrate an early mastery of his chosen subject matter and form. Often comprised of observations of nature, Wagoner links his speakers\u2019 predicaments and estrangement to the larger imperfection of the world. In Wagoner\u2019s second book, A Place to Stand, Roethke\u2019s influence is clear, and the book uses journey poems to represent the poet\u2019s own quest back to his beginnings. Wagoner\u2019s fourth book, The Nesting Ground (1963), reflects his relocation physically, aesthetically and emotionally; the Midwest is abandoned for the lush abundance of the Pacific Northwest, and Wagoner\u2019s style is less concerned with lamentation or complaint and more with cataloguing the bounty around him. James K. Robinson called the title poem from Staying Alive (1966) \u201cone of the best American poems since World War II.\u201d In poems like \u201cThe Words,\u201d Wagoner discovers harmony with nature by learning to be open to all it has to offer: \u201cI take what is: / The light beats on the stones, / the wind over water shines / Like long grass through the trees, / As I set loose, like birds / in a landscape, the old words.\u201d Robert Cording, who called Staying Alive \u201cthe volume where Wagoner comes into his own as a poet,\u201d believed that for Wagoner, taking what is involves \u201can acceptance of our fragmented selves, which through love we are always trying to patch together; an acceptance of our own darkness; and an acceptance of the world around us with which we must reacquaint ourselves.\u201d\n\nCollected Poems 1956-1976 (1976) was nominated for the National Book Award and praised by X. J. Kennedy in Parnassus for offering poems which are \u201cbeautifully clear; not merely comprehensible, but clear in the sense that their contents are quickly visible.\u201d Yet it was Who Shall Be the Sun? (1978), based upon Native American myth and legend, which gained critical attention. Hayden Carruth, writing in Harper\u2019s Magazine, called the book \u201ca remarkable achievement,\u201d not only for its presentation of \u201cthe literalness of shamanistic mysticism\u201d but also for \u201cits true feeling.\u201d Hudson Review\u2019s James Finn Cotter also noted how Wagoner \u201chas not written translations but condensed versions that avoid stereotyped language\u2026.The voice is Wagoner\u2019s own, personal, familiar, concerned. He has achieved a remarkable fusion of nature, legend and psyche in these poems.\u201d\n\nIn Broken Country (1979), also nominated for the National Book Award, shows Wagoner honing the instructional backpacking poems he had first used in Staying Alive. Leonard Neufeldt, writing in New England Review, called \u201cthe love lyrics\u201d of the first section \u201camong the finest since Williams\u2019 \u2018Asphodel.\u2019\u201d Wagoner has been accused of using staid pastoral conventions in book after book, as well as writing less well about human subjects. However, his books have continued to receive critical attention, often recognized for the ways in which they use encounters with nature as metaphors for encounters with the self. First Light (1983), Wagoner\u2019s \u201cmost intense\u201d collection, according to James K. Robinson, reflects Wagoner\u2019s third marriage to poet Robin Seyfried. And Publishers Weekly celebrated Walt Whitman Bathing (1996) for its use of \u201cplainspoken formal virtuosity\u201d which allows for \u201ca pragmatic clarity of perception.\u201d A volume of new and collected poems, Traveling Light, was released in 1999. Sampling Wagoner\u2019s work through the years, many reviewers found the strongest poems to also be the newest. Rachelle Ratner in Library Journal noted \u201csince many of the best are in the \u2018New Poems\u2019 section, it might make sense to wait for his next volume.\u201d That next volume, The House of Song (2002) won high praise for its variety of subject matter and pitch-perfect craft. Christina Pugh in Poetry declared \u201cThe House of Song boasts a superb architecture, and each one of its rooms (or in Italian, stanzas) affords a pleasure that enhances the last.\u201d In 2008 Wagoner published his twenty-third collection of verse, A Map of the Night. Reviewing the book for the Seattle Times, Sheila Farr found many poems shot through with nostalgia, adding \u201cthe book feels like a summing-up.\u201d Conceding that \u201cnot all the work reaches the high plane of Wagoner\u2019s reputation,\u201d Farr described its \u201cfinest moments\u201d as those which \u201cresonate with the title, venturing into darkness and helping us recognize its familiar places.\u201d\nIn addition to his numerous books of poetry, David Wagoner also is a successful novelist, writing both mainstream fiction and regional Western fiction. Offering a steady mix of drama seasoned with occasional comedy, Wagoner\u2019s tales often involve a naive central character\u2019s encounter with and acceptance of human failing and social corruption. In the Contemporary Authors Autobiography Series, Wagoner described his first novel, The Man in the Middle (1954), as \u201ca thriller with some Graham Greene overtones about a railroad crossing watchmen in violent political trouble in Chicago,\u201d his second novel, Money, Money, Money (1955), as a story about \u201ca young tree surgeon who can\u2019t touch, look at, or even think about money, though he has a lot of it,\u201d his third novel, Rock (1958) as a tale of \u201cteenage Chicago delinquents,\u201d and his fifth novel, Baby, Come On Inside (1968) as a story \u201cabout an aging popular singer who\u2019d lost his voice.\u201d As a popular novelist, however, Wagoner is best known for The Escape Artist (1965), the story of an amateur magician and the unscrupulous adults who attempt to exploit him, which was adapted as a film in 1981. Wagoner has produced four successful novels as a Western \u201cregional\u201d writer. Structurally and thematically, they bear similarities to his other novels. David W. Madden noted in Twentieth-Century Western Writers: \u201cCentral to each of these [Western] works is a young protagonist\u2019s movement from innocence to experience as he journeys across the American frontier encountering an often debased and corrupted world. However, unlike those he meets, the hero retains his fundamental optimism and incorruptibility.\u201d\n\r\nAlthough Wagoner has written numerous novels, his reputation rests on his numerous, exquisitely crafted poetry collections, and his dedication as a teacher. Harold Bloom said of Wagoner: \u201cHis study of American nostalgias is as eloquent as that of James Wright, and like Wright\u2019s poetry carries on some of the deepest currents in American verse.\u201d And Leonard Neufeldt called Wagoner \u201csimply, one of the most accomplished poets currently at work in and with America\u2026His range and mastery of subjects, voices, and modes, his ability to work with ease in any of the modes (narrative, descriptive, dramatic, lyric, anecdotal) and with any number of species (elegy, satirical portraiture, verse editorial, apostrophe, jeremiad, and childlike song, to name a few) and his frequent combinations of a number of these into astonishingly compelling orchestrations provide us with an intelligent and convincing definition of genius.\u201d\n\u00a0\n[Updated 2010]\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
