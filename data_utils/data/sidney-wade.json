She earned her PhD in English from the University of Houston, an MEd in counseling from the University of Vermont, and a BA in philosophy from the University of Vermont. Wade\u2019s books of poetry include Bird Book (2017), Straits & Narrows (2013), Stroke (2008), Celestial Bodies (2002), Green (1998), From Istanbul (1998)\u2014published in Istanbul where Wade was a Fulbright scholar\u2014and Empty Sleeves (1991). Her work is known for its elegant wordplay and interest in beauty and the sublime. Jordon Davis in Slate called Wade\u2019s imagination \u201cas powerful as any American poet\u2019s since Wallace Stevens,\u201d noting that her \u201cpoems always yield to paraphrase, pointing to something recognizable in the real world or the news. Her project\u2014to remain sane despite the gloom these words point to\u2014requires that she reassure herself and the reader that while we really are seeing what we\u2019re seeing, the consolations of light and love still exist.\u201d Wade\u2019s poetry has also earned praise for its intelligence and scope. Writing in the Rumpus, Randall Mann described Wade\u2019s unique place in contemporary poetry: \u201cIn our hyperaware age, Wade is highly unusual because she is neither interested in the airy sublime nor the backhanded glib gesture; she knows that things are tough all over; she believes that the best way to make one\u2019s way is to trust, in a gloriously mistrustful way, language.\u201d\nA professor of English at the University of Florida, Wade also edits the journal Subtropics and is a former president of the Association of Writers and Writing Programs. Wade spoke about her life as a poet, teacher, and editor to the online journal 32 Poems: \u201cIt\u2019s nerve-wracking work, writing poems, but when the work gets good and gets going, there\u2019s nothing better in the world,\u201d Wade acknowledged. \u201cSo that\u2019s probably the most challenging and rewarding at once. Editing Subtropics is easily the most simply rewarding, as I get to see, every week, every month, what very fine poems are being written around this country these days. And being able to tell people you\u2019d like to publish their work elicits marvelously joyful responses. Who couldn\u2019t love a regular influx of extremely happy emails? And teaching has its own pleasures and difficulties, the former fantastically outweighing the latter, thank goodness.\u201d\n", "attrs": {}}
