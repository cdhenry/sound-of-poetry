She studied first at Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, and later at Columbia University and the New School for Social Research in New York City. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Clampitt held various jobs at publishers and organizations such as Oxford University Press and the Audubon Society. In the 1960s, she turned her attention to poetry. In 1974 she published a small volume of poetry titled Multitudes, Multitudes; thereafter her work appeared frequently in the New Yorker. Upon the publication of her book of poems The Kingfisher in 1983, she became one of the most highly regarded poets in America. Her other collections include A Silence Opens\u00a0(1994), Westward\u00a0(1990), What the Light Was Like\u00a0(1985),\u00a0and\u00a0Archaic Figure\u00a0(1987). Clampitt received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Academy of American Poets. A member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Clampitt taught at the College of William and Mary, Amherst College, and Smith College.\nJoseph Parisi, a Chicago Tribune Book World reviewer, called the poet\u2019s sudden success after the publication of The Kingfisher \u201cone of the most stunning debuts in recent memory.\u201d Parisi continued, \u201cthroughout this bountiful book, her wit, sensibility and stylish wordplay seldom disappoint.\u201d In one of the first articles to appear after The Kingfisher\u2019s debut, New York Review of Books critic Helen Vendler wrote that \u201cAmy Clampitt writes a beautiful, taxing poetry. In it, thinking uncoils and coils again, embodying its perpetua argument with itself.\u201d Georgia Review contributor Peter Stitt also felt that \u201cThe Kingfisher is \u2026 in many ways an almost dazzling performance.\u201d In the Observer, Peter Porter described Clampitt as \u201ca virtuoso of the here and the palpable.\u201d Porter ranked her with the likes of Emily Dickinson and Elizabeth Bishop.\nCritics praised the allusive richness and syntactical sophistication of Clampitt\u2019s verse. Her poetry is characterized by a \u201cbaroque profusion, the romance of the adjective, labyrinthine syntax, a festival lexicon,\u201d said New York Times Book Review contributor Alfred Corn in an article about Clampitt\u2019s second important collection, What the Light Was Like (1985). Indeed, the poet\u2019s use of vocabulary and syntax is elaborate. \u201cWhen you read Amy Clampitt,\u201d suggests Richard Tillinghast in the New York Times Book Review, \u201chave a dictionary or two at your elbow.\u201d The poet has, Tillinghast continues, a \u201cvirtuoso command of vocabulary, [a] gift for playing the English language like a musical instrument and [a] startling and delightful ability to create metaphor.\u201d Her ability as a poet quickly gained Clampitt recognition as \u201cthe most refreshing new American poet to appear in many years,\u201d according to one Times Literary Supplement reviewer.\nClampitt\u2019s work is also characterized by erudite allusions, for which she provides detailed footnotes. Times Literary Supplement critic Lachlan Mackinnon compared her \u201cfinical accuracy of description and the provision of copious notes at the end of a volume,\u201d to a similar tendency in the work of Marianne Moore. \u201cShe is as \u2018literary\u2019 and allusive as Eliot and Pound, as filled with grubby realia as William Carlos Williams, as ornamented as Wallace Stevens and as descriptive as Marianne Moore,\u201d observed Corn. Washington Post reviewer Joel Conarroe added Walt Whitman and Hart Crane to this list of comparable poets: \u201cLike Whitman, she is attracted to proliferating lists as well as to \u2018the old thought of likenesses,\u2019\u201d wrote Conarroe. \u201cAnd as in Crane her compressed images create multiple resonances of sound and sense.\u201d\n\nWhat the Light Was Like centers around images of light and darkness. This book is \u201cmore chastely restrained than The Kingfisher,\u201d according to Times Literary Supplement contributor Neil Corcoran. Conarroe believed that the poet\u2019s \u201cown imagery throughout [the book] is sensuous (even lush) and specific\u2014in short, Keatsian.\u201d Corn similarly commented that \u201cthere are stirring moments in each poem, and an authentic sense of Keats\u2019 psychology.\u201d He opined, however, that \u201cher sequence [\u2018Voyages: A Homage to John Keats\u2018] isn\u2019t effective throughout, the reason no doubt being that her high-lyric mode\u201d does not suit narrative as well as a plainer style would.\n\r\nClampitt\u2019s Archaic Figure (1987) maintains her \u201cidiosyncratic style,\u201d as William Logan called it in the Chicago Tribune. New York Times Book Review contributor Mark Rudman noted the poet\u2019s \u201cspontaneity and humor; she is quick to react, hasty, impulsive, responsive to place\u2014and to space.\u201d In the London Sunday Times, David Profumo further praised Archaic Figure. Taking the example of the poem \u201cHippocrene,\u201d the critic asserted that this work \u201cdemonstrates her new powers of economy, the sureness of her rhythmic touch and the sheer readability of her magnificent narrative skills.\u201d \u201cAmy Clampitt,\u201d concluded Logan, \u201chas become one of our poetry\u2019s necessary imaginations.\u201d\nClampitt died in Lenox, Massachusetts in 1994.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
