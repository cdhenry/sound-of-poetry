He served as the Poetry Foundation\u2019s Children\u2019s Poet Laureate from 2006 to 2008. Prelutsky grew up in the Bronx, and when he was young he studied classical music; though he decided to concentrate on writing instead of\u00a0pursuing a career as an opera singer, he continues to sing.\nIn a Scholastic.com interview, when asked where his ideas come from, Prelutsky said, \u201cEverywhere! Everything I see or hear can become a poem. Several toys in my studio have turned into poems. I remember things that happened when I was a kid \u2026 Or I write about things I like or don\u2019t like. I love spaghetti and wrote a poem about it.\u201d Fabulous creatures and people inhabit his poems: the umbrellaphant, Uggs, and, in Scranimals (2002), banacondas, broccolions, and \u201cthe detested radishark.\u201d\nHe has written more than 70 children\u2019s books, often working with well-known illustrators such as Garth Williams, Arnold Lobel, and Marilyn Hafner. His poetry books include Stardines Swim High Across the Sky: and Other Poems (2013), The Swamps of Sleethe: Poems From Beyond the Solar System (2009), and Be Glad Your Nose Is on Your Facey And Other Poems (2008). He has also edited collections of poetry for children, including The 20th Century Children\u2019s Poetry Treasury (1999).\nPrelutsky lives in Seattle, Washington with his wife, Carolyn.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
