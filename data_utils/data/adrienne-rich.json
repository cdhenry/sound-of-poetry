Widely read and hugely influential, Rich\u2019s career spanned seven decades and has hewed closely to the story of post-war American poetry itself. Her earliest work, including\u00a0A Change of World\u00a0(1951) which won the prestigious Yale Younger Poets Award, was formally exact and decorous, while her work of the late 1960s and 70s became increasingly radical in both its free-verse form and feminist and political content. Rich\u2019s metamorphosis was summed up by Carol Muske-Dukes in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review; Muske wrote that Rich began as a \u201cpolite copyist of Yeats and Auden, wife and mother. She has progressed in life (and in her poems \u2026) from young widow and disenchanted formalist, to spiritual and rhetorical convalescent, to feminist leader ... and\u00a0doyenne\u00a0of a newly-defined female literature.\u201d Her poetry of the 1970s and 1980s serve as central texts for the second-wave feminist movement. When she died in 2012, she was one of the most respected American poets.\n\u00a0Beginning with\u00a0Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law: Poems 1954-1962\u00a0(1963), Rich\u2019s work has explored issues of identity, sexuality, and politics; her formally ambitious poetics have reflected her continued search for social justice, her role in the anti-war movement, and her radical feminism. Using the cadences of everyday speech, enjambment, and irregular line and stanza lengths, Rich\u2019s open forms have sought to include ostensibly \u201cnon-poetic\u201d language into poetry. Best known for her politically-engaged verse from the tumultuous Vietnam War period, Rich\u2019s collection\u00a0Diving into the Wreck: Poems 1971-1972\u00a0(1973) won the National Book Award. Rich accepted it with fellow-nominees Audre Lorde and Alice Walker on behalf of all women. Rich\u2019s numerous essay collections, including\u00a0A Human Eye: Essays on Art in Society\u00a0(2009) also secured her place as one of America\u2019s preeminent feminist thinkers. In addition to the National Book Award, Rich received many awards and commendations for her work, including the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, the Lannan Lifetime Achievement Award, the Bollingen Prize, the Academy of American Poets Fellowship, and a MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d Award. She made headlines in 1997 when she refused the National Medal of Arts for political reasons. \u201cI could not accept such an award from President Clinton or this White House,\u201d she wrote in a letter published in the\u00a0New York Times, \u201cbecause the very meaning of art as I understand it is incompatible with the cynical politics of this administration.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAdrienne Rich was born in 1929 in Baltimore, Maryland. Her father was a renowned pathologist and professor at Johns Hopkins. Her mother was a former concert pianist. Rich\u2019s upbringing was dominated by the intellectual ambitions her father had for her, and Rich excelled at academics, earning her degree from Radcliffe University. In 1953 she married Alfred Conrad, an economics professor at Harvard. She had three children with him, but their relationship began to fray in the 1960s as Rich became politically aware\u2014she later said that \u201cthe experience of motherhood was eventually to radicalize me.\u201d Rich\u2019s work of the 1960s and 70s begins to show the signs of that radicalization. Moving her family to New York in 1966, Rich\u2019s collections from this period include\u00a0Necessities of Life\u00a0(1966),\u00a0Leaflets\u00a0(1969), and\u00a0The Will to Change\u00a0(1971), all of which feature looser lines and radical political content. David Zuger, in\u00a0Poet and Critic,\u00a0described the changes in Rich\u2019s work: \u201cThe twenty-year-old author of painstaking, decorous poems that are eager to \u2018maturely\u2019 accept the world they are given becomes a ... poet of prophetic intensity and \u2018visionary anger\u2019 bitterly unable to feel at home in a world \u2018that gives no room / to be what we dreamt of being.\u2019\u201d\n\r\nConrad died in 1970 and six years later Rich moved in with her long-term partner Michelle Cliff. That same year she published her controversial, influential collection of essays\u00a0Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Institution and Experience\u00a0(1976). The volume, following on the heels of her masterpiece\u00a0Diving into the Wreck, ensured Rich\u2019s place in the feminist pantheon. Rich was criticized by some for her harsh depictions of men; however, the work she produced during this period is often seen as her finest. In\u00a0Ms.\u00a0Erica Jong noted that \u201cRich is one of the few poets who can deal with political issues in her poems without letting them degenerate into social realism.\u201d Focusing on the title poem, Jong also denies that Rich is anti-male. A portion of the poem reads: \u201cAnd I am here, the mermaid whose dark hair / streams black, the merman in his armored body. / We circle silently / about the wreck. / We dive into the hold. / I am she: I am he.\u201d Jong commented, \u201cThis stranger-poet-survivor carries \u2018a book of myths\u2019 in which her/his \u2018names do not appear.\u2019 These are the old myths ... that perpetuate the battle between the sexes. Implicit in Rich\u2019s image of the androgyne is the idea that we must write new myths, create new definitions of humanity which will not glorify this angry chasm but heal it.\u201d\n\r\nRich\u2019s prose collections are widely acclaimed for their erudite, lucid, and poetic treatment of politics, feminism, history, racism, and many other topics.\u00a0On Lies, Secrets, and Silence: Selected Prose, 1966-1978\u00a0(1979),\u00a0continues Rich\u2019s feminist intellectual project and contains one of Rich\u2019s most celebrated essays, \u201cWhen We Dead Awaken: Writing as Re-Vision,\u201d in which Rich clarifies the need for female self-definition. Publishing a new collection every few years, in 2009 Rich released\u00a0A Human Eye: Essays on Art in Society. Rich again explored the intersection of poetry and the political in essays and reviews.\u00a0San Francisco Gate\u00a0contributor Michael Roth noted that in the book \u201cRich continues to refuse to separate the artistic from the political, and she articulates in powerful ways how a truly radical political agenda can draw upon an aesthetic vision.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nRich\u2019s poetry has maintained its overtly political, feminist edge throughout the decades since the Vietnam War and the social activism of the 1960s and 70s. In collections like\u00a0Your Native Land, Your Life\u00a0(1986), Time\u2019s Power: Poems, 1985-1988\u00a0(1988),\u00a0and\u00a0An Atlas of the Difficult World: Poems, 1988-1991\u00a0(1991),\u00a0Rich begins to address the Jewish heritage that she was forced to hide during her early life. Throughout all three books, Rich uses personal experience, first-person narratives, and rich and varied language. Rich\u2019s later poetry engages the personal and political in ambitious ways. Though\u00a0Midnight Salvage, Poems, 1995-1998\u00a0(1999) is a quieter collection that focuses on \u201cthe quest for personal happiness,\u201d according to Rafael Campo who reviewed the volume for the\u00a0Progressive, it also circles \u201cthe problem of defining \u2018happiness\u2019\u2014in an American society that continues to exploit its most defenseless citizens, and in the face of a larger world where contempt for human rights leads to nightmare.\u201d Such an emphasis on the social conditions of private lives has been a mainstay in Rich\u2019s later work, which often explores the influence of contemporary world events.\u00a0The School among the Ruins: Poems, 2000-2004\u00a0(2004), which won the National Book Critics Circle Award, attempts to capture the myriad events that have defined the beginning of the 21st century. The predominantly short prose poems in\u00a0The School Among the Ruins\u00a0are free verse meditations on \u201cthe displacement of exiles, the encroachment of modernity on human dignity, and the effects of America\u2019s war against terror on the stateside psyche,\u201d wrote Meghan O'Rourke in\u00a0Artforum.\u00a0Although O'Rourke felt the collection veered too much into \u201crhetoric,\u201d other critics found the juxtaposition of cellphone and television dialogue stunningly effective.\r\n\u00a0\r\nRich\u2019s 2007 collection\u00a0Telephone Ringing in the Labyrinth\u00a0was her 24th; however, since the mid-50s, Rich has conceived of her poetry as a long process, rather than a series of separate books.\u00a0Telephone Ringing in the Labyrinth\u00a0continues to use open forms, including notebook-like fragments. The book as whole, noted Lee Sharkey in the\u00a0Beloit Poetry Journal,\u00a0is concerned with \u201cdissolution and disappearance\u2026The Rich persona who for half a century has been engaged in a continual process of undoing her own certainties owns up to how those certainties have blinded her.\u201d Layering images and utilizing a stripped-down line help contribute to \u201cthe new, still more difficult perspective she has achieved,\u201d Sharkey noted, though Rich \u201callows no point of resolution in the poem beyond juxtaposed images of cultural, environmental, and personal dissolution.\u201d\n\r\nThrough over 60 years of public introspection and examination of society and self, Adrienne Rich has chronicled her journey in poetry and prose. \u201cI began as an American optimist,\u201d she commented in\u00a0Credo of a Passionate Skeptic, \u201calbeit a critical one, formed by our racial legacy and by the Vietnam War ... I became an American Skeptic, not as to the long search for justice and dignity, which is part of all human history, but in the light of my nation\u2019s leading role in demoralizing and destabilizing that search, here at home and around the world. Perhaps just such a passionate skepticism, neither cynical nor nihilistic, is the ground for continuing.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
