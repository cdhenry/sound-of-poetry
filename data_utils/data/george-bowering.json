He served as an aerial photographer for the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1954 to 1957. Bowering\u2019s unadorned lyric poems often engage the matter of daily and literary life. In a 2007 interview with Rachel Loden for Jacket Magazine, Bowering discussed how his approach to writing shifts based on the form he is working in, stating, \u201cThe different forms offer somewhat different good feelings. I like the dance of syllables when poetry is the thing. I squirm in my chair. I like the daily advance of the story or novel or essay. Writing an essay is a lot like writing a story. The sentence is what you want, the sentence that is very clear but mysterious at the same time.\u201d On shortlisting Changing on the Fly for the 2005 Griffin Poetry Prize, the judge\u2019s citation notes, \u201cIn George Bowering\u2019s flight changes, lyric takes to the air \u2013 with spareness, resiliency and irrepressible humour. \u2026 Bowering is the poet of delight in earthly matters, of bemusement at the self. His lyrics turn out the streetlights (who needs them!) and light up the stars. And his lines try to understand what it is to exist, in the face of fears we all have, \u2018fears that I may cease to be.\u2019\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nBowering has published more than 80 books. His poetry collections include Urban Snow (1991), George Bowering Selected: Poems 1961\u20131992 (1993), Blonds on Bikes (1997), Changing on the Fly: The Best Lyric Poems of George Bowering (2004), and Teeth (2013).
