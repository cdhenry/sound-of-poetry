Collins was born in 1941 in New York City. He earned a BA from the College of the Holy Cross, and both an MA and PhD from the University of California-Riverside. In 1975 he cofounded the Mid-Atlantic Review with Michael Shannon. He has received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the New York Foundation for the Arts and has taught at Columbia University, Sarah Lawrence, and Lehman College, City University of New York, where he is a Distinguished Professor. He is also Senior Distinguished Fellow of the Winter Park Institute in Florida, and a faculty member at the State University of New York-Stonybrook.\nCollins\u2019s level of fame is almost unprecedented in the world of contemporary poetry: his readings regularly sell out, and he received a six-figure advance when he moved publishers in the late 1990s. He served two terms as the US poet laureate, from 2001-2003, was New York State poet laureate from 2004-2006, and is a regular guest on National Public Radio programs. In 2002, as US poet laureate, Collins was asked to write a poem commemorating the first anniversary of the fall of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center on September 11. The reading was in front of a joint session of Congress held outside of Washington, DC.\nThough Collins published throughout the 1980s, it was his fourth book, Questions about Angels (1991), that propelled him into the literary spotlight. The collection was selected by poet Ed Hirsch for the 1990 National Poetry Series. Collins\u2019s subsequent work has been regularly lauded for its ability to connect with readers. Discussing Picnic, Lightning (1998) and its predecessor, The Art of Drowning (1995), John Taylor noted that Collins\u2019s skillful, smooth style and inventive subject matter \u201chelps us feel the mystery of being alive.\u201d Taylor added: \u201cRarely has anyone written poems that appear so transparent on the surface yet become so ambiguous, thought-provoking, or simply wise once the reader has peered into the depths.\u201d\nTaking off Emily Dickinson\u2019s Clothes (2000) was the first Collins collection published outside the US. It selected work from his previous four books and was met with great acclaim in the UK. Poet and critic Michael Donaghy called Collins a \u201crare amalgam of accessibility and intelligence,\u201d and A.L. Kennedy described the volume as containing \u201cgreat verse, moving, intelligent and darkly funny.\u201d Sailing Alone Around the Room: New and Selected Poems (2001), the US version of Collins\u2019s selected, had a tumultuous journey to print. The story, which garnered a front-page slot in the New York Times, originally cast Collins\u2019s first publishers, the University of Pittsburgh Press, in an unfair light, accusing them of refusing to grant rights for poems requested by Random House for inclusion in Sailing Alone Around the Room. However, it later emerged that Random House had begun to produce the book without first securing rights from Pitt Poetry Press, a highly unusual move for a major publishing house to make. Dennis Loy Johnson reported on the controversy for Salon, noting that \u201cultimately it was Random House, not Pitt, that chose to delay the publication of Collins\u2019s selected volume.\u201d \u00a0The battle between Random House and the University of Pittsburgh Press was public and uncharacteristic of the world of poetry publishing. When Sailing Alone Around the Room was finally published, in 2001, it was met with enthusiastic reviews and brisk sales.\nCollins\u2019s next books Nine Horses: Poems (2002), The Trouble with Poetry (2005), Ballistics (2008), Horoscopes for the Dead (2011), Aimless Love (2013), and The Rain in Portugal (2016) have continued to offer poems that mix humor with insight. Reviewing Nine Horses for the New York Times, Mary Jo Salter commented that Collins\u2019s \u201coriginality derives, it seems, from the marriage of a loopy, occasionally surreal imagination \u2026 to an ordinary life observed in just a few ordinary words.\u201d She added that \u201cone appeal of the typical Collins poem is that it\u2019s less able to help you memorize it than to help you to remember, for a little while anyway, your own life.\u201d But Collins\u2019s emphasis on writing\u2014and writing \u201cordinary life\u201d at that\u2014can, for some critics, make his poetry seem pedestrian or one-note. However, many readers find Collins a source of warmth, wit, and surprisingly sure technique, and reviewers have consistently noted how Collins\u2019s poems manifest a literal concern for their readers. John Deming in Cold Front Mag has discussed Collins\u2019s concern for those reading his poems because \u201cthe transmission of poem to head takes place always elsewhere and in silence, in the mysterious space where poems live\u2026Collins lets us access this place with alarming graciousness, and the openness of his voice probably helps account for his popularity.\u201d\nPoet-critic Richard Howard has said of Collins: \u201cHe has a remarkably American voice\u2026that one recognizes immediately as being of the moment and yet has real validity besides, reaching very far into what verse can do.\u201d Collins has described himself as \u201creader conscious\u201d: \u201cI have one reader in mind, someone who is in the room with me, and who I\u2019m talking to, and I want to make sure I don\u2019t talk too fast, or too glibly. Usually I try to create a hospitable tone at the beginning of a poem. Stepping from the title to the first lines is like stepping into a canoe. A lot of things can go wrong.\u201d Collins further related: \u201cI think my work has to do with a sense that we are attempting, all the time, to create a logical, rational path through the day. To the left and right there are an amazing set of distractions that we usually can\u2019t afford to follow. But the poet is willing to stop anywhere.\u201d\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
