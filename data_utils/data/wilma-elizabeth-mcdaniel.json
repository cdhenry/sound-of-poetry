A sharecropper\u2019s daughter and one of eight children, she and her family moved to California during the Great Depression. In California, she picked fruit, worked in retail, and was a housekeeper, completing her high school diploma through correspondence study while reading widely on her own.  \u00a0 McDaniel didn\u2019t begin publishing her work until she was in her mid-fifties. She self-published her first book The Carousel Would Haunt Me (1973); by then her work was appearing regularly in the Tulare Advance-Register, and she was named the official Bicentennial Poet and Poet Laureate of Tulare. McDaniel published over 51 chapbooks in her lifetime. Known for its eyewitness accounts of the migrant and Okie experience, McDaniel\u2019s work is valued for its unique ability to convey the lives and perceptions of working class children, youth, and adults. According to scholar Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, McDaniel was \u201ca storyteller, too. And her speech was exactly like her writing. \u2026 People learned language from her.\u201d Dunbar-Ortiz included McDaniel\u2019s writing in her anthology Red Dirt: Growing Up Okie (1996; reissued 2006).  \u00a0 McDaniel received wide recognition in California\u2019s Central Valley as a chronicler of Okie experience. She was the subject of the documentary Down an Old Road: The Poetic Life of Wilma Elizabeth McDaniel (2001), and in 2008 Oklahoma State University created the oral history project Remembering Wilma Elizabeth McDaniel: Poet and Oklahoma Dust Bowl Emigrant to record stories from those who knew McDaniel. Oklahoma State University Library has also established the Wilma McDaniel Collection to preserve and house her archive. McDaniel\u2019s letters, memorabilia, photos, and books are in libraries both in Oklahoma and California.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
