She is the author of the full-length collection The Nomenclature of Small Things (2016) and the chapbooks Tiktaalik, Adieu (2014) and Theories of Rain (2009). The Nomenclature of Small Things braids vocabularies of science and grief together; in an interview, Pedersen states, \u201cI was interested in the patterns of grief I recognized during years of fertility issues, and I felt compelled to try to express those experiences\u2014though there isn\u2019t a good vocabulary for grief in today\u2019s English language. The controlling hypothesis or goal\u2014if I can call it that\u2014was to see if the language of science can be used as a filter for grief.\u201d\nPedersen has been a Pushcart Prize and Georgia Author of the Year nominee. A playwright as well, she is a member of the Dramatists Guild of America and a cofounder of the Atlanta Women\u2019s Poetry Collective. She lives in Atlanta, Georgia.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"]}}
