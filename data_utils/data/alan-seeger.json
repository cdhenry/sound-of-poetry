He is best known for his war poem, \u201cI Have a Rendezvous with Death,\u201d and has often been compared with Rupert Brooke, a contemporary English soldier-poet who also died in World War I. Seeger has been criticized for his impersonal, conventional, and idealizing verses, but critics acknowledge these as being the weaknesses of youth. James Hart in the Dictionary of Literary Biography explained, \u201cHe needed more time to move from a stock and outmoded romanticism to a more distinctive and original style, from a style full of abstractions to one more concrete and personal.\u201d\nThe son of Charles Louis Seeger, a businessman with sugar refining concerns in Mexico, Alan Seeger was born in New York City, and grew up in a wealthy and cultured home in Staten Island. His sister, Elizabeth, and brother, Charles (who became a noted musicologist), were close in age. Seeger attended the Staten Island Academy and then the Horace Mann School in Manhattan until the age of 12. His family then moved to Mexico City; in 1902 Alan returned with his brother Charles to New York to attend the Hackley School, in Tarrytown. Following his graduation from the Hackley School, Seeger attended Harvard University, where, as a budding poet, he was influenced by the Romantic poets while other poets at Harvard, such as T.S. Eliot, were experimenting with more modern verse. He also translated Dante Alighieri\u00a0and Ludovico Ariosto and helped edit the Harvard Monthly, in which he published many of his poems. He graduated from Harvard with a BA in 1910.\nAfter graduating, Seeger moved to Greenwich Village in New York City. There he attempted to live out his romanticized notion of bohemian life, living wholly through the senses (as opposed to the mind). His father was not pleased with his decision to evade the pursuit of a responsible career in favor of the pursuit of beauty. Still, Seeger continued writing poetry and slept on the couch of his classmate and notorious revolutionary, John Reed. After two years Seeger decided New York did not live up to his ideals so, with funding from admiring friends, he left for Paris, France.\nIn Paris, Seeger reveled in his new friendships among the artists in the Latin Quarter. He found his ideals of beauty embodied by the city. There is also evidence that he fell in love in the poems \u201cDo You Remember Once\u201d and \u201cThe Rendezvous,\u201d and also in a telegram to his father. When war broke out between France and Germany in 1914, Seeger enlisted in the French Foreign Legion to defend his beloved France.\nApparently seeking the utmost of excitement in life, Seeger also had a fatalistic streak, and seemed attracted to the possibility of his death. Victor Chapman, in Victor Chapman\u2019s Letters from France, questioned Seeger\u2019s emotional state before joining the Legion: \u201cSeeger was an appalling wreck before the war.\u201d In his letters, Seeger told of crowded quarters, filth, cold and misery; but only his romantic views of the war make their way into his poetry, unlike that of more realistic and anti-war poets such as Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. His admiration for Sir Philip Sidney and familiarity with the age of chivalry caused him to cast his comrades as mediaeval crusaders. Ever a fatalist, the outcome of the war was of less interest to Seeger than the glory of comradeship and adventure.\nSeeger\u2019s poem \u201cI Have a Rendezvous with Death\u201d tells of an expected meeting between the narrator and Death himself. Though the narrator of the poem regrets leaving behind life\u2019s pleasures and love, he does not fear or abhor death. Instead he is stoic, making the rendezvous a matter of honor. Hart described the curious relationship between the narrator and Death: \u201cThe union of fallen soldier and Death is, unfortunately, not based upon any profound philosophical or religious belief, but upon a vague romantic fusion of nature\u2019s beauty, sexual love, and life in some undefined other realm.\u201d His \u201cOde in Memory of the American Volunteers Fallen for France\u201d is considered less aggrandizing and egocentric, and therefore a stronger work, but \u201cRendezvous\u201d was still more famous. In 1916, Seeger died (ironically on July 4th) in the attack on Belloy-en-Santerre, where he was shot in the stomach. Following his death, the French military awarded him the Croix de Guerre and the M\u00e9daille militaire. He was buried in a mass grave.\nSeeger\u2019s collected Poems were published in 1917 to mixed reviews. Critics often find that Seeger had not yet matured as an artist, displaying too much of his enthusiasm for the Romantic poets. Hart wrote that Seeger\u2019s \u201cview of the rightful behavior for an aesthete and poet filtered and colored his recording of his experiences.\u201d F.F. Kelley in Bookman found in Seeger\u2019s poems \u201cImaginative beauty and much nobility of expression,\u201d but still considered the poems limited in scope: \u201cTheir viewpoint is always that of the conventionally romantic and, fine in spirit and pleasing in form although the poems are, one looks in them in vain for any glimpse of forward shining light.\u201d H.F. Armstrong, in Dial, compared Seeger to his contemporary Rupert Brooke, and laments that the two poets did not live long enough to realize their potential: \u201cA large part of the poems in this volume can reasonably well stand on their strictly literary merits. \u2026 We like to think that if Rupert Brooke had lived he would have eliminated from his final volume some of the unnecessary gaucheries of expression, as well as some of the unworthy compositions which were rushed into print under the impulse of the sudden fame brought about by his death. The same thought occurs in the case of Alan Seeger.\u201d Still, Seeger\u2019s poetry remained popular throughout the war with soldiers in the trenches and with supporters at home.\nSeeger\u2019s Letters and Diary\u00a0(1917) met with criticism for its impersonal tone, although some reviewers also found the book of historical interest and relevance.\u00a0A critic at the Boston Transcript wrote, \u201cIt is for America as well as for France that these letters speak. They come to the public eye at a most propitious moment.\u201d A critic writing for the Independent found the writing vivid and literary, but \u201ccuriously impersonal. There is hardly an anecdote, hardly a mention of an individual. Idiosyncrasies of character, incidents of trench life were not his interest and yet you live trench life with him, and you breathe the very spirit of the war.\u201d\nThe French have particularly honored Seeger as a poet who memorialized the fighting that took place in their country during World War I, and they have published numerous tributes to him since his death. A street in Biarritz, France, was named after Seeger in the 1970s. Although, as Hart writes, \u201cmany of [Seeger\u2019s] poems are now, with justice, labeled second rate,\u201d they are still valuable, \u201cas a manifestation of the idealism that swept over his generation.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
