Her father was a Palestinian refugee and her mother an American of German and Swiss descent, and Nye spent her adolescence in both Jerusalem and San Antonio, Texas. She earned her BA from Trinity University in San Antonio. Nye is the recipient of numerous honors and awards for her work, including the Ivan Sandrof Award for Lifetime Achievement from the National Book Critics Circle, the Lavan Award, the Paterson Poetry Prize, the Carity Randall Prize, the Isabella Gardner Poetry Award, the Lee Bennett Hopkins Poetry award, the Robert Creeley Prize, and many Pushcart Prizes. She has received fellowships from the Lannan Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, and she was a Witter Bynner Fellow. From 2010 to 2015 she served as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. In 2018 she was awarded the Lon Tinkle Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Texas Institute of Letters. Nye is the Poetry Foundation's Young People's Poet Laureate.\nNye\u2019s experience of both cultural difference and different cultures has influenced much of her work. Known for poetry that lends a fresh perspective to ordinary events, people, and objects, Nye has said that, for her, \u201cthe primary source of poetry has always been local life, random characters met on the streets, our own ancestry sifting down to us through small essential daily tasks.\u201d In her work, according to Jane Tanner in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, \u201cNye observes the business of living and the continuity among all the world\u2019s inhabitants \u2026 She is international in scope and internal in focus.\u201d Nye is also considered one of the leading female poets of the American Southwest. A contributor to Contemporary Poets wrote that she \u201cbrings attention to the female as a humorous, wry creature with brisk, hard intelligence and a sense of personal freedom unheard of\u201d in the history of pioneer women.\n\r\nNye continues to live and work in San Antonio, Texas. \u201cMy poems and stories often begin with the voices of our neighbors, mostly Mexican American, always inventive and surprising,\u201d Nye wrote for Four Winds Press. \u201cI never get tired of mixtures.\u201d A contributor to Contemporary Southern Writers wrote that Nye\u2019s poetry \u201cis playfully and imaginatively instructive, borrows from Eastern and Middle Eastern and Native American religions, and resembles the meditative poetry of William Stafford, Wallace Stevens, and Gary Snyder.\u201d Nye\u2019s first two chapbooks were published in the 1970s. Both Tattooed Feet (1977) and Eye-to-Eye (1978) are written in free verse and structured around the theme of a journey or quest. They announced Nye as a \u201cwandering poet,\u201d one interested in travel, place, and cultural exchange. In her first full-length collection, Different Ways to Pray (1980), Nye explores the differences between, and shared experiences of, cultures from California to Texas, from South America to Mexico. In \u201cGrandfather\u2019s Heaven,\u201d a child declares: \u201cGrandma liked me even though my daddy was a Moslem.\u201d As Tanner observed, \u201cwith her acceptance of different \u2018ways to pray\u2019 is also Nye\u2019s growing awareness that living in the world can sometimes be difficult.\u201d\nNye\u2019s next books include On the Edge of the Sky (1981), Hugging the Jukebox (1982), a full-length collection that also won the Voertman Poetry Prize, and Yellow Glove (1986). In Hugging the Jukebox, Nye emphasized the ordinary connections between diverse peoples and the perspectives of those in other lands. She writes: \u201cWe move forward, / confident we were born into a large family, / our brothers cover the earth.\u201d Reviewers praised the book, noting Nye\u2019s warmth and celebratory tone. Writing in the Village Voice, Mary Logue commented that in Nye\u2019s poems about daily life, \u201cNye often pulls gold from the ordinary.\u201d The poems in Yellow Glove presented a perspective tempered by tragedy and sorrow. In \u201cBlood\u201d Nye considers the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. She describes a caf\u00e9 in combat-weary Beirut, bemoans \u201ca world where no one saves anyone,\u201d and observes \u201cThe Gardener\u201d for whom \u201ceverything she planted gave up under the ground.\u201d Georgia Review contributor Philip Booth declared that Nye brings \u201chome to readers both how variously and how similarly all people live.\u201d In Red Suitcase (1994), Nye continued to explore the effect of on-going violence on everyday life in the Middle East. Writing for Booklist, Pat Monaghan explained that \u201csome of her most powerful poems deal with her native land\u2019s continuing search for peace and the echoes of that search that resound in an individual life. Nye is a fluid poet, and her poems are also full of the urgency of spoken language. Her direct, unadorned vocabulary serves her well: \u2018A boy filled a bottle with water. / He let it sit. / Three days later it held the power / of three days.\u2019 Such directness has its own mystery, its own depth and power, which Nye exploits to great effect.\u201d\nNye\u2019s next book, Fuel (1998), received wide acclaim. The poems range over a variety of subjects, settings and scenes. Reviewing the book for Ploughshares, Victoria Clausi regarded it as, above all, an attempt at connection: \u201cNye\u2019s best poems often act as conduits between opposing or distant forces. Yet these are not didactic poems that lead to forced epiphanic moments. Rather, the carefully crafted connections offer bridges on which readers might find their own stable footing, enabling them to peek over the railings at the lush scenery.\u201d Like her mentor, William Stafford, Nye again and again manifests her \u201cbelief in the value of the overlooked, the half-forgotten,\u201d wrote Clausi, as well as investigating global concerns like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A reviewer for Publisher\u2019s Weekly found that \u201cNye\u2019s witnessings of everyday life and strife never quite acquire collective force, yet they convey a delicate sense of moral concern and a necessary sense of urgency.\u201d\nAfter the World Trade Center attacks in 2001, Nye became an active voice for Arab Americans, speaking out against both terrorism and prejudice. The lack of understanding between Americans and Arabs led her to collect poems she had written which dealt with the Middle East and her experiences as an Arab American into one volume. 19 Varieties of Gazelle: Poems of the Middle East (2002) was a finalist for the National Book Award. Publisher\u2019s Weekly declared that it was \u201can excellent way to invite exploration and discussion of events far away and their impact here at home.\u201d Nye\u2019s next book, You and Yours (2005), continued to explore the Middle East and the possibilities of poetic response. Divided into two sections, the first deals with Nye\u2019s personal experiences as a mother and traveler and intersperses Nye\u2019s typical free-verse with prose poems. Part two examines the Middle East with \u201cindignity and compassion,\u201d according to Publisher\u2019s Weekly. Donna Seaman wrote that the book is \u201ctender yet forceful, funny and commonsensical, reflective and empathic,\u201d adding, \u201cNye writes radiant poems of nature and piercing poems of war, always touching base with homey details and radiant portraits of family and neighbors. Nye\u2019s clarion condemnation of prejudice and injustice reminds readers that most Americans have ties to other lands and that all concerns truly are universal.\u201d The book received the Isabel Gardner Poetry Award. Nye\u2019s recent collections of poetry include Transfer (2011), Voices in the Air: Poems for Listeners (2018), and The Tiny Journalist (2019).\nIn addition to poetry, Nye has written fiction for children, poetry and song recordings, and poetry translations. She has also published a book of essays, Never in a Hurry (1996), and edited several anthologies, including the award-winning This Same Sky (1992), which represents 129 poets from sixty-eight countries. In her introduction to the anthology Nye writes, \u201cWhenever someone suggests \u2018how much is lost in translation!\u2019 I want to say, \u2018Perhaps\u2014but how much is gained!\u2019\u201d Booklist critic Hazel Rochman called it \u201can extraordinary anthology, not only in its global range \u2026 but also in the quality of the selections and the immediacy of their appeal.\u201d Nye also compiled and edited a bilingual anthology of Mexican poetry, The Tree Is Older Than You Are (1995), and she edited the collection I Feel a Little Jumpy around You (1996), which combines 194 \u201chis and her\u201d poems, pairing a poem written by a man with one written by a woman. Nye\u2019s anthology The Space between Our Footsteps (1998) is a collection of the work of 127 contemporary Middle Eastern poets and artists representing nineteen countries.\nAs a children\u2019s writer, Nye is acclaimed for her sensitivity and cultural awareness. Her book Sitti\u2019s Secrets (1994) concerns an Arab American child\u2019s relationship with her sitti\u2014Arabic for grandmother\u2014who lives in a Palestinian village. Booklist, praised Nye for capturing the emotions of the \u201cchild who longs for a distant grandparent\u201d as well as for writing a narrative that deals personally with Arabs and Arab Americans. In 1997 Nye published Habibi, her first young-adult novel. Readers meet Liyana Abboud, an Arab American teen who moves with her family to her Palestinian father\u2019s native country during the 1970s, only to discover that the violence in Jerusalem has not yet abated. As Liyana notes, \u201cin Jerusalem, so much old anger floated around \u2026 [that] the air felt stacked with weeping and raging and praying to God by all the different names.\u201d Autobiographical in its focus, Habibi was praised by Karen Leggett, who noted in the New York Times Book Review that the novel magnifies through the lens of adolescence \u201cthe joys and anxieties of growing up\u201d and that Nye is \u201cmeticulously sensitive to this rainbow of emotion.\u201d Nye sees her writing for children as part of her larger goals as a writer. As Nye explained to a Children\u2019s Literature Review contributor, \u201cto counteract negative images conveyed by blazing headlines, writers must steadily transmit simple stories closer to heart and more common to everyday life. Then we will be doing our job.\u201d Nye has since published poetry for young adults, including Come With Me: Poems for a Journey (2000) and A Maze Me: Poems for Girls (2005). Nye has received many awards for her writing for children, including the NSK Neustadt Award for Children\u2019s Literature and the 2018 May Hill Arbuthnot Honor Lecture Award from the American Library Association.\n\r\nNye has been affiliated with the Michener Center for writers at the University of Texas and poetry editor for the Texas Observer for over 20 years. She is a professor of creative writing at Texas State University. Nye told Contemporary Authors: \u201cI have always loved the gaps, the spaces between things, as much as the things. I love staring, pondering, mulling, puttering. I love the times when someone or something is late\u2014there\u2019s that rich possibility of noticing more, in the meantime \u2026 Poetry calls us to pause. There is so much we overlook, while the abundance around us continues to shimmer, on its own.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
