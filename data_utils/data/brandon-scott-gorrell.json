His involvement with online social networking sites and blogging can be seen as an extension of his postmodern confessional work.\nIn a 2009 interview with Emily Nonko for Bomblog, Gorrell spoke of the inspiration behind the poems in his debut collection, during my nervous breakdown i want to have a biographer present (2009), stating, \u201cI was probably inspired by feeling bad, or kind of beautiful, or lonely, or \u2018introspective,\u2019 or \u2018like I wanted to write something to make people like me,\u2019 or some other feeling/emotion.\u201d\nGorrell lives in Seattle, where he works as a freelance writer.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
