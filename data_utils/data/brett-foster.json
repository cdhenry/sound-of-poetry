His first collection of poetry, The Garbage Eater (2011), was a finalist for a Drake University Emerging Writer Award and was selected for the Debut Poets feature in Poets & Writers magazine. He also published the chapbook Fall Run Road (2011). In an interview, Foster noted the role of the spiritual or religious in his work: \u201cpoetry is for me \u2026 a place to work out ideas, sure, but more centrally the heart\u2019s matters, the cries of the heart\u2014those things that the mind would deign to ponder, or might be confounded by. That\u2019s poetry\u2019s forge, and when it\u2019s most exciting and satisfying (on poetry\u2019s own terms, I mean), it\u2019s a place that is free, open, safe, and surprising. Poems aren\u2019t catechisms. They are, in their insights and vulnerabilities, better than that.\u201d  \u00a0 Foster\u2019s creative work frequently includes references to his scholarly pursuits; he has written on Donne, Shakespeare, and Renaissance-period Rome. His editing projects and works of scholarship included\u00a0Shakespeare\u2019s Life (2012), Shakespeare Through the Ages: The Sonnets (2009), Shakespeare Through the Ages: Hamlet (2008), and Rome (2005). Foster was a Wallace Stegner Fellow at Stanford University and taught at Wheaton College in Illinois. He died in 2015 at the age of 42.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
