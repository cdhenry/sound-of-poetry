His poverty and untimely suicide represented the martyrdom of the poet by the materialistic society of his time. William Wordsworth, listing in \u201cResolution and Independence\u201d (1807) those poets to whom he owed most, describes Chatterton as \u201cthe marvellous Boy, // The sleepless Soul that perished in his pride.\u201d Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote a monody on Chatterton; Robert Southey edited his poems (1803); John Keats dedicated Endymion (1817) to him; in \u201cAdonais\u201d (1821) Percy Bysshe Shelley ranks Chatterton with Sir Philip Sidney as \u201cinheritors of unfulfilled renown\u201d:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chatterton\r\nRose pale,\u2014his solemn agony had not\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Yet faded from him ...\r\nOblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reproved.\nAlfred de Vigny, Robert Browning, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Francis Thompson wrote about him; George Meredith posed for Henry Wallis\u2019s painting of his death.\nChatterton, for a variety of reasons to a large extent relating to the state of letters in his time, achieved the status of a myth. This is not to discount his formidable influence on English, French, and German literature through his \u201cRowley\u201d poems, which he attributed to a 15th-century Bristol priest, Thomas Rowley. His acknowledged satires and periodical essays were too scurrilous or too close to the work of fashionable contemporaries to attract much attention after his death. In literary history, Chatterton\u2019s invention of Rowley coincides with other famous \u201cforgeries\u201d: James Macpherson\u2019s Ossian, which preceded him, and William Henry Ireland\u2019s Shakespeare, which followed.\nChatterton\u2019s suicide in a London garret at the age of 17, the victim of starvation and despair, enhanced his social and literary significance to an archetypal level. The life and death of Chatterton coincided with new widespread awareness of political ideas, individual potentialities, class differences, and the stultifying narrowness of provincial life. In contrast to the ephemerality and shoddiness of commercial practice and political maneuver, to an age suffused with a revolutionary spirit Chatterton\u2019s peculiar vigor of imagination and apparent martyrdom seemed purer and more spiritual. Thus he came to represent to the Romantics and their successors a kind of idealism in the face of the rationalizing materialism of the 18th century. William Blake\u2019s rejection of Isaac Newton and John Locke was anticipated by the Bristol youngster who plunged into the world of the 15th century to release his creative energy. The life of his own time provided him with a subject for satire; that of the past left him uninhibited, free to explore the possibilities of poetry.\nChatterton was born on November 20, 1752 in Bristol, the posthumous son of a schoolmaster\u2014also named Thomas\u2014of an eccentric disposition but with strong musical and antiquarian interests. The elder Thomas Chatterton\u2019s ancestors had been sextons of the church of Saint Mary in the parish of Redcliff for generations. His wife, Sarah Young Chatterton, was only 17 and already the mother of their young daughter when they married in 1749. Chatterton grew up in a household of women (his father\u2019s mother lived with them) precariously maintained by his mother\u2019s work as a needlewoman. Stories of Chatterton\u2019s apparent early inability to learn to read and being in consequence judged stupid; his falling in love with an illuminated manuscript at the age of six, after which he did little but read and demonstrate his precocity; his haunting of bookshops; his passion for fame; and his sense that the loss of his father deprived both himself and his family of the standing they might have otherwise had in the community all add color and poignancy to his story. The constant proximity of the old and beautiful church, however, with whose fabric his ancestors had been so closely connected, nurtured his extraordinary sensibility and sheltered his strong ego from the rebuffs which a thriving commercial and maritime community dealt to the growth of his wayward temperament.\nAt the age of eight Chatterton was sent to Colston\u2019s charitable foundation, where his education was geared to the vocational requirements of his community\u2014commerce and law\u2014rather than to encouraging the development of his imagination through classical training. At the end of his schooling he was indentured to a local lawyer, John Lambert, as a scrivener or copy clerk. His employer beat him on finding out that he wrote poetry in his spare time, and, tearing up what he had written, forbade him to continue. There were like-minded young men with whom he gossiped and for whom he produced verse exercises of various kinds. Thomas Phillips, the usher at Colston\u2019s, had been regarded as a remarkable versifier, but Phillips died in 1769; Chatterton\u2019s three elegies to Phillips show he had been to some extent a fellow spirit.\nChatterton\u2019s earliest recollections were of the Gothic beauty of the church of Saint Mary Redcliff. It had been founded in the 15th century by William Canning, mayor of Bristol and a romantic figure of enormous wealth and property. Rather than obey King Edward\u2019s command to marry a second wife after the death of his first, he had entered a monastery. Among his contemporaries had been Thomas Rowley, at one time sheriff of Bristol; for Chatterton, Canning was to become enshrined in the role of patron to Rowley, who was cast by the boy as priest, poet, and chronicler. The strategic role of Bristol as gateway to the West Country and the men who ventured from Bristol to fight in patriotic struggles against the invaders who threatened the independence of England and the liberty of its people were to be \u201cRowley\u2019s\u201d themes.\nCanning\u2019s name had been featured in leases, heraldry, buildings, grants of property, and bequests in documents housed in chests in the muniment room of Saint Mary Redcliff. Chatterton\u2019s father had used old parchments left in disorder to cover his pupils\u2019 books, and after his death his widow used strips of the parchments for thread papers. Chatterton collected all the remnants of parchment he could find and took them to a lumber room which he appropriated for his own use. There his solitary brooding, combined with the unsatisfactory nature of his daily life, encouraged the surrealistic dreamlike quality of his narratives, the vigorous dramatic evocativeness of his poems, and the passionate outpourings of his heroes and heroines.\nIn his reading Chatterton encountered the Ossian fragments and epics of Macpherson, which had become the rage of the polite world in the 1760s. He also read Thomas Percy\u2019s three-volume Reliques of Ancient English Poetry (1765), with Percy\u2019s \u201cEssay on the Ancient Minstrels,\u201d where differences between ancient and modern ballads were discussed. Equally important, as Bertrand Bronson has shown, was Elizabeth Cooper\u2019s The Muses Library (1737), a 400-page account of such older English poets as Edward the Confessor, Samuel Daniel, William Langland, John Gower, Geoffrey Chaucer, Thomas Occleve, Alexander Barclay, and the earl of Surrey. If one adds to these the collection Old Plays (1744) by Robert Dodsley; the works of the antiquarians of the previous century; the dictionaries and encyclopedias of the 18th century; Thomas Speght\u2019s edition of the works of Chaucer (1598); and the poetry of Edmund Spenser, Thomas Gray, William Collins, and William Shakespeare, one can see that Chatterton\u2019s imaginative resources were rich indeed.\nBristol was the second largest city in England and was growing fast in commerce. Its historic role as a strategic gateway to the West Country, and consequently in the warlike struggles of the remote past, enabled Chatterton to cast it in a mythical role. Its origin was swathed in legend; its fortunes were intertwined with the fate of the nation; it had played its part in the lives and deaths of the Saxon monarchs; its men had fought against foreign invaders; its citizens and poets had been munificent and learned. The present reality of the town for anyone who was poor and lacked social connections, however, was dire. If influential friends did not exist, they had to be made. The caliber of friends that might be made in Bristol did not seem promising, an irritating state of affairs for so proud and sensitive an adolescent as Chatterton.\nChatterton\u2019s first attempt to confront present-day Bristol with its past came with his successful submission to the local newspaper, Felix Farley\u2019s Bristol Journal, of a piece on the opening of the Old Bridge over the river Severn so that it might be compared with the opening of the new in 1768. Civic pride and a sense of occasion, pageantry, and history combine in Chatterton\u2019s piece, which re-creates ancient Bristol for the 18th-century reader. It attracted the attention of William Barrett, a surgeon and local antiquary, whose History of Bristol (1789) was to include much Rowley material as genuine and of George Catcott, a local pewterer, who questioned Chatterton on his sources for the fifteenth-century account (as it had been represented) of the Old Bridge. At this point the existence of the manuscripts in the muniment room and in Mrs. Chatterton\u2019s house became public. Barrett\u2019s own collection of such manuscripts was augmented by Rowleian productions handed to him by Chatterton. Following the publication of the Old Bridge piece on October 1, 1768 Chatterton gave Barrett Rowley\u2019s \u201cMemoirs,\u201d \u201cEpitaph on Robert Canynge,\u201d \u201cSonge to \u00c6lla,\u201d \u201cYellow Roll,\u201d \u201cBristow Tragedy,\u201d the first part of \u201cThe Battle of Hastings,\u201d \u201cThe Parliament of Sprytes,\u201d \u201cThree Eclogues,\u201d and the \u201cTragedy of Godwynn,\u201d as well as a \u201cHistory of Bristol,\u201d supposedly by the 11th-century prior of Durham, Turgot, with Rowley\u2019s emendations (Chatterton cunningly offered material which would attract an antiquary and reinforced the forgery with pedantry, also forged, to enhance its supposed authenticity). So it was to impress the somewhat opaque intelligence of his Bristol acquaintances that Chatterton entrusted to them a great part of his richest and most spontaneously produced Rowley material. Consequently, not only was none of the Rowley poetry published during Chatterton\u2019s lifetime but his \u201cfriends\u201d were among the most adamant after his death in asserting that the boy they had known could not possibly have written the Rowley poems.\nIf Chatterton compiled history to catch Barrett, he prepared a pedigree to catch Henry Burgum, Catcott\u2019s partner. The \u201cAccount of the De Berghams from the Norman Conquest to this time\u201d was exposed when Burgum checked the fabrication with the College of Heralds and discovered the hoax. But in the meantime he had parted with a small sum of money which Chatterton might have scorned but certainly needed. It was clear that he must fly higher to catch a worthwhile patron. He wrote to James Dodsley, a London publisher, who may have given him moderate encouragement. His next target was suggested by success in the same field. Horace Walpole, who had acknowledged his authorship of The Castle of Otranto (1764) only in its second edition, having at first pretended he had found the manuscript in an old chest, had recently had a new edition of the first volume of his Anecdotes of Painting in England (1762) published. What better ploy than to have Canning send Rowley to catalogue the paintings of the 15th century in a journey around Britain in order to whet Walpole\u2019s appetite for unknown artists? Walpole had already been taken in by Macpherson and was inclined to be a little wary; at first, however, he was enthusiastic enough and welcomed Chatterton\u2019s opening gambit, a piece titled \u201cThe Rise of Peyncteynge yn Englande, wroten bie T. Rowleie, 1469 for Mastre Canynge.\u201d Walpole gave courteous encouragement: \u201cGive me leave to ask you where Rowley\u2019s poems are to be found. I should not be sorry to print them, or at least a specimen of them, if they have never been printed.\u201d\n\r\nChatterton not only sent poems but disclosed the truth of his own situation\u2014that he was the son of a poor widow and wished to be released from his drudgery as an attorney\u2019s apprentice. The obviously modern tone of the specimens Walpole received (particularly of the Pastorals) and his vulnerability to imposture and consequent ridicule resulted at first in neglect of the correspondence, then in the brusque dismissal of any hopes Chatterton might have had from this particular great man.\n\r\nAfter Chatterton\u2019s suicide Walpole was cast in the role of persecutor of the indigent and youthful genius. For more than 20 years Walpole battled to rescue his reputation from this slur, but the neatness of the opposition between the rich dilettante and the poverty-stricken and tragic youth was too intriguing to be laid completely to rest. The immediate difficulty for Chatterton was Walpole\u2019s delay in returning the manuscripts. Walpole had pointed out that the harmoniousness of the verses was too modern, as well as the improbability of their surviving from Anglo-Saxon times. Chatterton rebuts this criticism in a letter to Walpole of April 14, 1769:\n\r\nThe Harmony is not so extraordinary:\u2014as Joseph Iscan is altogether as harmonious\u2014\r\nThe Stanza Rowley wrote in, instead of being introduc\u2019d by Spencer was in use 300 Years before ... by Rowley\u2014tho\u2019 I have seen some Poetry of that Age\u2014exceeding Alliterations without Rhyme\u2014\n\r\nI shall not defend Rowleys Pastoral: its merit can stand its own defence\u2014\r\nRowley was employ\u2019d by Canynge to go to the Principal Monasterys in the Kingdom to Collect drawings, Paintings & all MSS relating to Architecture\u2014is it then so very extraordinary he should meet with the few remains of Saxon Learning\u2014\u2019Tis allow\u2019d by every Historian of Credit, that the Normans destroy\u2019d all the Saxon MSS, Paintings &c that fell in their Way; endeavoring to suppress the very Language\u2014the want of knowing what they were, is all the Foundation you can have for stiling them a barbarous Nation.\nThe last sentence asserts an older identity than that which had provided England with its civilized veneer since the Restoration. All invaders, whether French fashions or Norman soldiers, had been set on the obliteration of an indigenous culture. The first history of English poetry (1774\u20131781), by Thomas Warton, was to chart the same awareness of an older tradition. Warton\u2019s understanding of this tradition, however, was an academic one in comparison with that of Chatterton, whose Rowley poems he learned of too late. The episode with Walpole is clearly a clash between lord and low-born apprentice; it reveals the antagonism of cosmopolitan sophistication versus provincial authenticity. Chatterton\u2019s last letter to Walpole, on July 24, 1769, at last elicited the manuscripts: \u201cI think myself injured, sir; and, did not you know my circumstances, you would not dare to treat me thus. I have sent twice for a copy of the MS.:\u2014No answer from you. An explanation or excuse for your silence would oblige.\u201d\nAlthough the situation, like the contention between Samuel Johnson and Lord Chesterfield over the patronage for Johnson\u2019s Dictionary (1755), sets low against high in true folk fashion, Chatterton, as his dedicated biographer, E.H.W. Meyerstein, points out, had merely not succeeded in imposing on Walpole. His verses that were not sent to Walpole because \u201cmy Sister persuaded me out of it\u201d affirm his fixed purpose:\nScorn I will repay with Scorn, & Pride with Pride.\nStill Walpole, still, thy Prosy Chapters write\nAnd twaddling Letters to some fair indite,\nLaud all above thee,\u2014Fawn and Cringe to those\nWho, for thy fame, were better Friends than Foes...\nHad I the Gifts of Wealth and Luxury shar\u2019d\nNot poor & Mean\u2014Walpole! thou hadst not dared\nThus to insult. But I shall live and stand\nBy Rowley\u2019s side\u2014when Thou are dead and damned.\n\r\nThe Town and Country Magazine published Rowley\u2019s \u201cElinor and Juga\u201d in June 1769, but from this time Chatterton seems to have written in propria persona, producing only a few more pieces by Rowley in the remaining months of his life. Among the poems written in Chatterton\u2019s own name are several elegies, notably on Phillips, in which dramatic life is given to the evocation of his friend\u2019s poetic power. The stanza echoes Gray, the imagery Collins, yet the characteristic Chatterton registering of the impact of light and movement foreshadows Keats:\nWhen golden Autumn, wreathed in riped\u2019d corn,\nFrom purple clusters prest the foamy wine,\nThy genius did his sallow brows adorn,\nAnd made the beauties of the season thine.\nPale rugged Winter bending o\u2019er his tread,\nHis grizzled hair bedropt with icy dew;\nHis eyes, a dusky light congeal\u2019d and dead,\nHis robe, a tinge of bright ethereal blue;\n\u00a0\nHis train a motley\u2019d sanguine sable cloud,\nHe limps along the russet dreary moor;\nWhilst rising whirlwinds, blasting keen and loud,\nRoll the white surges to the sounding shore.\n\r\nChatterton\u2019s state of mind in his last autumn months suggests that of William Cowper. \u201cElegy II\u201d concludes,\n\u00a0A dreary stillness broods o\u2019er all the vale,\n\u00a0\u00a0 The clouded Moon emits a feeble glare;\nJoyless I seek the darkling hill and dale,\n\u00a0\u00a0 Where\u2019er I wander Sorrow still is there.\n\r\nBut a Promethean figure expresses a self-sustaining pride in the fragment the editors Donald S. Taylor and Benjamin B. Hoover title \u201cHeroic Fragment\u201d in The Complete Works of Thomas Chatterton (1971):\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He fled\nEternal Vengeance flaming o\u2019er his head\nHe clash\u2019d the Clouds bade swelling Thunders sound\nAnd rapid whirls the forky Lightnings round\nA Triune Substance of etherial Smoke\nThe Godhead stood confest and thus he spoke.\n\r\nThe sheer variety of his output at this time exhibits both fluency and determination to succeed. From August to November he wrote burlesques; a burletta, Amphitryon; elegies; an antique piece, \u201cThe Hirlas\u201d; satires on the themes of Interest, Happiness, and Conversation; a \u201cJournal\u201d in Hudibrastics; and \u201cEpistle to Catcott.\u201d At this time, too, he wrote \u201cElegy, Written at Stanton Drew,\u201d on a Maria who had departed from him. Chatterton\u2019s female acquaintances were numerous: there is evidence of a Rochester-like dismissal of those who had served their turn. A letter from one Esther Saunders, written on April 3, 1770, offers to meet him \u201cin the morning for ... we shant be seen a bout 6 a Clock But we must wait with patient for there is a Time for all Things.\u201d Chatterton adds a note: \u201cThere is a time for all things\u2014Except Marriage my Dear And so your hbl Servt. T. Chatterton, April 9th.\u201d\nHe freely satirized figures in the town, and his attacks on provincial life offer continuing evidence of the precocity and cynicism of his attitudes. In \u201cHappiness\u201d he declaims:\nConscience, the Soul-Camelion\u2019s varying hue\nReflects all Notions to no Notion true\nThe bloody Son of Jesse when he saw\nThe mystic Priesthood kept the Jews in awe\nHe made himself an Ephod to his Mind\nAnd sought the Lord and always found him kind\nIn Murder, horrid Cruelty and Lust\nThe Lord was with him, and his Actions just....\nContent is Happiness as Sages say\nBut what\u2019s Content? The Trifle of a Day\nThen Friend let Inclination be thy Guide\nNor be by Superstition led aside\nThe Saint and Sinner Fool and Wise attain\nAn equal Share of Easiness and Pain.\n\r\nIf in public he were to go from cynic to calumniator in his satires on the developing political crisis, his home life remained close and affectionate. \u201cThe Antiquity of Christmas Games,\u201d published in the Town and Country Magazine in December 1769, probably helped with the family finances. \u201cThe Copernican System,\u201d published in the same month, indicates a resolve to make his living by writing, as Richard Savage, a fellow poet, had tried but failed to do. But he was bound to his master, Lambert, and could not get away to London and literary life. He had become a free-thinker and wrote out his \u201cArticles of Belief,\u201d which were not published until 1842 (in C.B. Willcox\u2019s edition of The Poetical Works of Thomas Chatterton): \u201cThat God being incomprehensible: it is not required of us, to know the mysterys of the Trinity &c. &c. &c. &c.\u201d He goes on:\nThat it matters not whether a Man is a pagan Turk Jew or Christian\nif he acts according to the Religion he professes\nThat if a man leads a good moral Life he is a Christian\nThat the Stage is the best School of Morality\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and\nThe Church of Rome (some Tricks of Priestcraft expected) is\ncertainly the true Church.\n\r\nChatterton admired the satiric point and flair of Charles Churchill and the patriotic stance of John Wilkes against the party of the Dowager Princess of Wales and her reputed lover, Lord Bute. The manipulation of the king by the princess and Bute in the interests of the Scottish party drew Chatterton\u2019s fire. He addressed the duke of Grafton on the occasion of his resignation from the prime ministership: \u201cyour whole administration has been derogatory to the honour and dignity of the crown; for the honour of the crown is the liberty of the subject.\u201d This piece appeared in the Monthly Journal for February 24, 1770. His next major piece, \u201cThe Whore of Babylon\u201d\u2014the title refers to the Dowager Princess of Wales\u2014remained unpublished until 1803 (in Robert Southey and Joseph Cottle\u2019s edition of The Works of Thomas Chatterton), \u201cResignation\u201d appeared in the Freeholder\u2019s Magazine in April and May 1770; Bute is one of the targets:\nFir\u2019d by Ambition he resolved to roam\nFar from the famine of his native home...\nClad in his native many-colour\u2019d Suit\nForth struts the walking Majesty of Bute ...\nA joy prophetic untill then unknown\nAssur\u2019d him all he view\u2019d would be his own ...\nFate beheld him as he trudg\u2019d the Street\nBare was his buttocks and unshod his feet. ...\n\r\nThe strains of John Dryden and Alexander Pope have collapsed into the burlesque mockery of Churchill.\nWith the Wilkes furor reaching its climax\u2014Wilkes was again elected to the House of Commons and again expelled by the government\u2014Chatterton had a fortune to seek through the press, where new periodicals such as the Freeholder\u2019s Magazine had been founded to voice the sentiments of those opposed to the government. So ripe must the time have seemed for his new life to begin that Chatterton found a way to extricate himself from his apprenticeship. On 14 April he devised a last will and testament, which begins, \u201cAll this wrote bet 11 & 2 oclock Saturday in the utmost Distress of Mind.\u201d He addresses Burgum:\nIf ever obligated to thy Purse\nRowley discharges all; my first chief Curse\nFor had I never known the antique Lore\nI ne\u2019er had ventured from my peaceful Shore\nTo be ye wreck of promises and hopes\nA Boy of Learning and a Bard of Tropes\nBut happy in my humbler Sphere had mov\u2019d\nUntroubled unrespected unbelov\u2019d.\n\r\nAfter specifying memorials to be placed on the tombs of his ancestors he devises his own:\nTo the Memory of Thomas Chatterton. Reader Judge not;\nif thou art a Christian, believe that he shall be Judged by a\nSuperior Power, to that Power only is he now answerable\u2014\n\r\nListing his (ironic) bequests, he includes Moderation \u201cto the Politicians on both Sides the Question\u201d and Abstinence \u201cto the Company at the Sheriffs annual feast in General more particularly to the Aldermen.\u201d He leaves his \u201cDebts in the whole not five Pounds to the Payment of the Charitable and generous Chamber of Bristol\u201d; he leaves his mother and sister to \u201cthe protection of my Friends if I have any,\u201d and ends with arrangements for the printing of the will. The clear delight in his own inventiveness and the satiric mischief in the document do not conceal the real desperation and wretchedness of his plight. His scheme succeeded: the largely factitious emotions were assumed to be authentic, and Lambert released him from his apprenticeship. Chatterton was free to go to London to make his fortune. He left Bristol on April 17, for the first and last time. He had already written to booksellers and publishers in London, and he visited them promptly on the evening of his arrival.\nFrom then on the pace of his life and the hectic qualities of his letter writing increased. At first he took lodgings in a house in Shoreditch with one of his relatives. From there he wrote glowing accounts of his fashionable acquaintance and of his influence with London publishers. He had already established connections with the editors of the Town and Country Magazine, the Middlesex Journal, and the Freeholder\u2019s Magazine. For the most part his work was taken by editors who favored the populist causes of Wilkes, so that when the government clamped down on their activities and imprisoned the editor of the Freeholder\u2019s Magazine in July Chatterton\u2019s market became constricted. It was reduced, too, by the sudden death of a potential patron, William Beckford, Lord Mayor of London. The controversy over Wilkes\u2019s election to the House of Commons and his expulsion therefrom by the government raged throughout April and May; it was fanned on May 23 by the lord mayor\u2019s \u201chumble remonstrance\u201d to the king at his rejection of London\u2019s petition that Wilkes should be restored to his seat. Beckford had violated decorum and was hailed as a hero by the Wilkes party. Chatterton wrote his characteristically portentous letters to the lord mayor, addressing him as \u201cProbus.\u201d He received some reward and hoped for more, but on June 21, Beckford died. A celebrated anecdote concerns a letter written to one of his Bristol friends giving an account of what he had gained through writing essays and elegies and lost in patronage by the lord mayor\u2019s death, ending with \u201cam glad he is dead by [\u00a3] 3 13 6.\u201d\nMost of his works at this time\u2014the long satire \u201cKew Gardens,\u201d referring to the establishment there of the Dowager Princess of Wales; \u201cThe Candidate\u201d; and the contributions by \u201cDecimus\u201d and \u201cMenemus\u201d to the Middlesex Journal\u2014are politically partisan. \u201cAn Exhibition of Sign Paintings\u201d appeared on May 26 (the success of the Wilkes group had been connected with its anti-Hogarth Exhibition of Sign Paintings, in which the authors pilloried the government). He earned a little money from periodical stories such as \u201cLetter of Maria Friendless,\u201d which was published in the Town and Country Magazine of June 15, 1770, and \u201cMemoirs of a Sad Dog,\u201d published in the same magazine in July and August. Lyric pieces were published in the London Magazine in June 1770 and in the Court and City Magazine in July. These poems mark a new venture into exotic themes and images. The perspectives are cosmic in grandeur: the fiery imagination of Rowley is transposed into a world of more universalized mythology. The description of the river in \u201cThe Death of Nicou an African Eclogue\u201d previews that by Coleridge in \u201cKubla Khan\u201d (1797): \u201cFiercely propell\u2019d the whiten\u2019d billows rise / Break from the cavern and ascend the skies. ...\u201d The prowess of Nicou exceeds in splendor and spaciousness the motions of Keats\u2019s Titans:\nStrong were the warriors, as the ghost of Cawn,\nWho threw the hill of archers to the lawn:\nWhen the soft earth at his appearance fled;\nAnd rising billows played around his head:\nWhen a strong tempest rising from the main,\nDash\u2019d the full clouds, unbroken, on the plain.\nNicou, immortal in the sacred song,\nHeld the red sword of war, and led the strong;\nFrom his own tribe the sable warriors came,\nWell try\u2019d in battle, and well known in Fame.\nNicou, descended from the god of war,\nWho liv\u2019d coeval with the morning star....\n\r\nIn the later piece \u201cAn African Song\u201d a slighter vein of lyric luxury is still characteristic:\nHaste, ye purple gleams of light,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Haste and gild the spacious skies;\nHaste, ye eagles, take your flight,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Haste and bid the morning rise.\n\u00a0\nNow the eastern curtain draws;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now the red\u2019ning splendor gleams;\nNow the purple plum\u2019d maccaws,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Skim along the silver streams.\n\u00a0\nNow the fragrant-scented thorn,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trembles with the gummy dew;\nNow the pleasures of the morn,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Swell upon the eager view.\n\r\nThe musical units are still sure; the delicacy of sensation is remarkable, and the capacity to startle with a freshness of association is characteristically Chatterton\u2019s. Although his predominantly satiric work is similar to that of Lloyd and Churchill, there are signs that his temperament is seeking new and imaginative means of lyric expression.\nIn June Chatterton moved from Shoreditch to the house of Mrs. Angel, a sacque-maker in Brooke Street. About this time he must have written, or more likely improved, his \u201cExcelente Balade of Charitie,\u201d the only poem of this period written in the Rowleian style. It was not accepted for publication by the Town and Country Magazine, which merely printed an acknowledgement of its receipt. The poem describes how Charity and Love are not found \u201caminge highe elves\u201d for \u201cKnights and Barons live for pleasure and themselves.\u201d The poor man of the poem is assailed by bad weather:\nListe! now the thunder\u2019s rattling clymminge [noisy] sound\nCheves [moves] slowlie on, and then, embollen [swelled], clangs,\nShakes the hie spyre, and losst, dispended, drown\u2019d,\nStill on the gallard [frighted] eare of terroure hanges;\nThe windes are up; the lofty elmen swanges;\nAgaine the levynne and the thunder poures,\nAnd the full cloudes are braste [burst] attenes [at once] in stonen showers.\n\r\nAn abbot refuses to give alms; a priest takes pity on him. The poem ends:\nVirgynne and hallie Seyncte, who sitte yn gloure [glory],\nOr give the mittee [mighty, rich] will, or give the gode man power.\nThe sentiments of the poem have long been supposed those of Chatterton himself as his fortunes sank even lower. He wrote to his old Bristol acquaintance William Barrett for support in gaining a position as a ship\u2019s surgeon, but, since Chatterton had no medical training, Barrett could hardly do other than refuse. The openings for his work were reduced by the measures taken by the government against its opponents; in any case, the Town and Country Magazine had already accepted as much material as it could publish. The doldrums of August had descended on the town. In \u201cMemoirs of a Sad Dog\u201d Chatterton traces the decline in fortune of a wealthy young man poetically left at leisure to reflect on Ossianic landscapes: \u201cThe man who sits down to write his own history, has no very agreeable task to execute.\u201d Left 5,000 pounds which he squanders on women, employed by a booby who is visited by a certain \u201cBaron Otranto, who has spent his whole life in conjectures,\u201d and fooled by an inscription on a stone in much the same way as the Pickwickians in Dickens\u2019s novel, his fortunes are briefly rescued by luck in gambling; but the Sad Dog loses his money again in an unlucky love adventure and returns to London to work for the magazines: \u201cas I know the art of Curlism pretty well, I make a tolerable hand of it. But, Mr Printer, the late prosecutions against the booksellers having frightened them all out of their patriotism, I am necessitated either to write for the entertainment of the public, or in defence of the ministry. As I have some little remains of conscience the latter is not very agreeable ... \u201d\u2014nor, perhaps, at this juncture, very practicable. The story is close to Chatterton\u2019s own.\nThe last presents for home were sent with confident and affectionate letters to his mother and sister, the two women who remained the center of his emotional concern. He promised more gifts and future good fortune, but in fact he was being beset by the ironically named Mrs. Angel. On July 20 he wrote to his sister, \u201cI have an universal acquaintance: my company is courted every where; and could I humble myself to go into a compter, could have had twenty places before me now; but I must be among the great: State matters suit me better than commercial. The ladies are not out of my acquaintance.\u201d The last statement, at least, was true. In a letter to George Catcott in Bristol, dated August 12, he wrote: \u201cAngels, according to the Orthodox Doctrine, are Creatures of the Epicene Gender, like the Temple Beaux: the Angel here, is of no such materials; for staggering home one Night from the Jellyhouse, I made bold to advance my hand under her covered way, and found her a very very Woman. She is not only an Angel, but an arch Angel; for finding I had Connection with one of her Assistants, she has advanced her demands from 6s to 8s 6 per Week, assured that I should rather comply than leave my Dulcinea, & her soft embraces.\u201d At this date he was still hoping that Barrett might help him to the post of ship\u2019s surgeon. The near 50 percent increase in his rent must have been the final blow to his finances. Chatterton\u2019s \u201cA Hunter of Oddities,\u201d published in September in the Town and Country Magazine, includes an exchange in which a lodger asks his landlady what he may be given for dinner, and it concludes \u201cYour score is now seven and thirty shillings; and I think it is time it should be cleared.\u201d Mrs. Angel told a neighbor that, knowing Chatterton had not eaten for two or three days, she begged him to take a meal with her on August 24, but that he refused. The same day he was reputed to have tried to beg a loaf from a baker he knew. A neighboring chemist, Mr. Cross, suggested after Chatterton\u2019s death that he was using vitriol to cure himself of venereal disease, which seems a likely hazard of his life-style at this time. In the course of the night of August 24, he committed suicide by swallowing opium and then arsenic in water. At the time he died, an Oxford scholar, Dr. Thomas Fry, had started to inquire about the Rowley poems.\nIn terms of Chatterton\u2019s literary achievement there seemed to be a total opposition between the political and often scabrous satires comprising the bulk of his acknowledged work and the Rowley productions that had been left in Bristol. Catcott had amassed a large number of the Rowley poems, and Barrett possessed those apparently relating to the history of Bristol. Fascination with the Rowley material grew as doubts were expressed about its authenticity. In 1776 Thomas Tyrwhitt, the eminent scholar and editor of Chaucer, undertook to edit the Rowley poems, and his edition appeared in 1777. He became convinced they were Chatterton\u2019s forgeries. In 1778 Chatterton\u2019s Miscellanies in Prose and Verse appeared, and the debate raged, with voluminous attacks, rebuttals, and massive periodical coverage for the next 15 years. The age of the parchments, Chatterton\u2019s lack of opportunity and knowledge, and his desire for the fame the poems might have brought him were the arguments of the Rowleians; that forgeries had previously been fabricated on edges and scraps of old parchment used for deeds and other documents, that most of the poems were transcripts, that they contained historical inaccuracies, and other evidence of modern composition were those of their opponents. In the third edition of the Rowley poems in 1778 Tyrwhitt included an appendix proving that their language showed them Chatterton\u2019s, and in the same year Warton reached the same conclusion in the second volume of his History of English Poetry. At this time other threads of the Chatterton web were being explored by men who were more interested in his life than in his poetry. Herbert Croft\u2019s Love and Madness (1780) printed Chatterton\u2019s letters to his mother and sister (bought by Croft for a trifling sum) for the first time and also enhanced the sensational aspects of his death. What Meyerstein calls the \u201cponderous obscurantism\u201d of Dean Jeremiah Milles of Exeter and of Dr. Robert Glynn of King\u2019s College, Cambridge, coincided with these developments, and the battle in periodicals and pamphlets raged from 1780 onward, with Warton, Edmund Malone, and even the queen\u2019s solicitor general, George Hardinge, joining in. And fresh Rowley and Chatterton material continued to be brought out of obscurity. In 1797, to alleviate the poverty of Chatterton\u2019s sister and niece, Southey and Joseph Cottle decided to edit Chatterton\u2019s works, including the Rowley material, and to publish them by subscription. This edition appeared in three volumes in 1803.\nJohn Dix\u2019s The Life of Thomas Chatterton (1837) included the \u201cLast Lines\u201d for the first time. David Masson provided an exemplary account of the political maelstrom into which Chatterton entered in the novel Chatterton: A Story of the Year 1770 (1874), which was emended and published as a biography in 1899. In France and Germany the revolutionary feelings of the early 18th century found affinities in the story of Chatterton; in Alfred de Vigny\u2019s drama Chatterton (1835) the poet\u2019s ghost saves the destitute Francis Thompson from a similar fate. His triumphs as a poet are the theme of Daniel Wilson\u2019s Chatterton (1869) and Charles Edward Russell\u2019s Thomas Chatterton: The Marvellous Boy (1908). His most formidable biographer, Meyerstein, was surely haunted by him, as his lines written on Chatterton show. Peter Ackroyd\u2019s best-selling novel Chatterton (1987) is a contemporary witness to his magic. Linda Kelly describes him in The Marvellous Boy (1971) as a mythical figure evoking something beyond his achievement, a haunting reminder of the fascination and power of the imagination.\nThe admiration of the Romantic poets for Rowley extended from Coleridge through Browning to Rossetti, who assisted in the preparation of the next notable edition of the poems, that of the Reverend Walter W. Skeat in 1871. It is this edition which offered conclusive evidence of the forgery by identifying the sources of Chatterton\u2019s Rowleyese (chiefly the dictionaries of John Kersey [1708] and Nathan Bailey [1736]). Skeat also translated the Rowley poems into modern English. In this exercise he was assisted by the enthusiastic Rossetti, who wrote to Skeat on May 13, 1880: \u201cI keep some archaisms to give colour, but not many.\u201d Rossetti was not unaware, however, of the \u201cRowley rhythm,\u201d and referred to Malone\u2019s suggestion that the true test to establish whether Rowley was written by Chatterton would be \u201cto run the 3 \u2018African Eclogues\u2019 (the only ones which are poetry proper among the \u2018acknowledged\u2019 class) into Rowleian idiom, and that the common and even equal parentage will then be at once apparent.\u201d Rossetti also points out that Christopher Smart\u2019s Song to David (1763) has \u201cfar more sterling English pith than anything else so early in that era\u201d; both Smart and Chatterton, he says, were revivifying older native strains of poetry. For Rossetti, \u201cNot to know Chatterton is to be ignorant of the true day-spring of modern romantic poetry.\u201d At arguably the most crucial stage in his poetic development, Keats wrote to John Hamilton Reynolds on September 22, 1819: \u201cChatterton ... is the purest writer in the English Language ... \u2018tis genuine English idiom in English words. I have given up Hyperion\u2014there were too many Miltonic inversions in it.\u201d Skeat\u2019s translation of Rowley, whatever it did for the intelligibility of Chatterton\u2019s work, alerted readers to the musicality of his construction. However outlandish some of his coinages might seem, the sheer fluidity and versatility of his poetry induced a fresh awareness of the possibilities open to the poet.\nChatterton\u2019s Rowley uses language to convey a reality not of cognition but of the imagination. His verse, whether dramatic or lyric, excels in its sense of occasion, physicality, color, and incantation. There is the sense of the event, of the poetic utterance, to charm the reader\u2014or, better still, the listener\u2014as in \u201cThe Parlement of Sprytes\u201d:\nSoon as the Morn but newlie wake,\nSpyed Nyghte ystorven Lye;\nOn herre Corse dyd dewedroppes shake\u2014\nThen fore the Sonne upgotten was I\u2014\nThe Rampynge lyon, felle tygere,\nThe bocke that skyppes from place to place;\nThe olyphaunt and rhynocere,\nBefore mee throughe the greene woode I dyd chace\u2014\nNymrodde as Scryptures hyght mie Name,\nBaalle as jetted Stories saie.\n\r\nBlake\u2019s comment is clearly apposite: \u201cI believe both Macpherson and Chatterton that what they say is ancient, is so.\u201d\n\r\nThe displacement of reality as presented in history or social narrative is in the interests of a subtle modulation of tone and feeling, as in \u00c6lla: A Tragycal Enterlude:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The soldyers stoode uponne the hillis side,\nLyke yonge enlefed trees whyche yn a forreste byde.\n\r\nManhood\u2019s promise, described thus, holds a hint of its wasting by war. Birtha\u2019s much anthologized song, \u201cO! synge untoe mie roundlaie / O! droppe the brynie teare wythe mee,\u201d not only echoes Ophelia; it is a plangently dramatized lament set in the shocks of a ruthless war in which the Danish enemy exhibits his own sense of physical force:\n\u00a0\u00a0 Whene swefte-fote tyme doe rolle the daie alonge,\n\u00a0\u00a0 Some hamlette scalle onto oure fhuyrie brende;\n\u00a0\u00a0 Brastynge alyche a rocke, or mountayne stronge,\n\u00a0\u00a0 The talle chyrch-spyre apon the grene shalle bende;\n\u00a0\u00a0 Wee wylle the walles, and auntyante tourettes rende,\n\u00a0\u00a0 Pete everych tree whych golden fruyte doe beere,\n\u00a0\u00a0 Down to the goddes the owners dhereof sende,\nBesprengynge all abrode sadde warre and bloddie weere.\n\r\nIn Goddwyn: A Tragedie the conceptualization of an ancient patriotism takes on a modern note in the personification of Freedom. It is a Freedom envisaged in the context of emotion, overpowering opposition, and warlike death in the face of insuperable odds. The courage, fluency, and spellbinding musicality of metaphor and stress insist on the physical force and energy of the confrontation:\nWhan Freedom dreste, yn blodde steyned Veste,\n\u00a0 To everie Knyghte her Warre Songe sunge;\nUponne her hedde, wylde Wedes were spredde,\n\u00a0 A gorie Anlace bye her honge.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She daunced onne the Heathe,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She hearde the Voice of Deathe;\n\u00a0\nPale-eyned Affryghte hys harte of Sylver hue,\nIn vayne assayled [endeavored] her bosomme to acale [graze];\nShe hearde onflemed [undismayed] the shriekynge Voice of Woe,\nAnd Sadnesse ynne Owlette shake the Dale.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She shooke the burled [pointed] Speere,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On hie she jeste [hoisted] her Sheelde,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Her Foemen all appere,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And flizze [fly] alonge the feelde\u2014\nPower, wythe his Heafod [head] straughte [stretched] ynto the Skyes,\nHis Speere a Sonne beame, and his Sheelde a Starre;\nAlyche twaie brendynge Gonfyres [two flaming meteors] rolls hys Eyes,\nChaftes [stamps] with hys Yronne feete, and soundes to War\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She syttes upon a Rocke,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She bendes before hys Speere;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She ryses from the Shocke\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wieldynge her owne in Ayre.\nHard as the Thonder, dothe she drive ytte on,\nWytte scillye wympled gies [closely mantled guides] ytte to hys Crowne,\nHys longe sharpe Speere, hys spreddynge Sheelde ys gon\nHe falles and fallynge rolleth thousandes down\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 War, goare faced War, bie Envie burld [armed], arist [arose],\nHis feerie Heaulme [helmet] noddynge to the Ayre;\nTenne bloddie Arrowes ynne hys streynynge fyste ...\n\r\nThe momentum, power, and\u2014for all its dramatic action and charged atmosphere\u2014the barren rhythms of Chatterton\u2019s vision are distinctive still. His antique world gave him a freedom denied him elsewhere; in its terms he experienced the emotions and creative energies of a doomed yearning for a fulfillment that conditions of the modern world inhibited. There is the promise of the primitive, the unspoiled, in his sweetest lyrical phrases, where a still golden world beckons. In isolation he can listen to the illuminations of past lives with their color, idealism, and fulfillment. In \u201cThe Course of a Particular\u201d Wallace Stevens wrote:\nI hear the motions of the spirit and the sound\nOf what is secret becomes, for me, a voice\nThat is my own voice speaking in my ear.\n\r\nIt is still worth straining one\u2019s ears to listen to the voice of Chatterton.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Augustan"]}}
