By 1915, he was in Chicago, where he worked for the Evening Post until 1929,photographing disasters such as the Eastland capsizing, notorious celebrities such as Al Capone, and U.S. presidents. As one of the only Japanese American photographers working in the United States at the time, Fujita was commissioned to photograph federal works projects between the wars. He co-owned a cabin on a remote island near Rainer, Minnesota, and spent long periods there, painting and writing poetry, mostly haiku and tanka. His first book of poems was called Tanka: Poems in Exile (1923).\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Art Institute of Chicago holds some of Fujita\u2019s color photographs of natural landscapes.
