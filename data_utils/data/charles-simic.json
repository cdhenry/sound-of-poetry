His work has won numerous awards, among them the 1990 Pulitzer Prize, a MacArthur Foundation \u201cgenius grant,\u201d the Griffin International Poetry Prize, the\u00a0Wallace Stevens\u00a0Award, and the appointment as US poet laureate. He taught English and creative writing for over 30 years at the University of New Hampshire. Although he emigrated to the US from Yugoslavia as a teenager, Simic writes in English, drawing upon his own experiences of war-torn Belgrade to compose poems about the physical and spiritual poverty of modern life. Liam Rector, writing for the\u00a0Hudson Review,\u00a0has noted that the author\u2019s work \u201chas about it a purity, an originality unmatched by many of his contemporaries.\u201d Though Simic\u2019s popularity and profile may have increased dramatically over the two decades, his work has always enjoyed critical praise. In the\u00a0Chicago Review,\u00a0Victor Contoski characterized Simic\u2019s work as \u201csome of the most strikingly original poetry of our time, a poetry shockingly stark in its concepts, imagery, and language.\u201d\u00a0Georgia Review\u00a0correspondent Peter Stitt wrote: \u201cThe fact that [Simic] spent his first eleven years surviving World War II as a resident of Eastern Europe makes him a going-away-from-home writer in an especially profound way. \u2026 He is one of the wisest poets of his generation, and one of the best.\u201d\nSimic spent his formative years in Belgrade. His early childhood coincided with World War II and his family was forced to evacuate their home several times to escape indiscriminate bombing; as he has put it,\u00a0\u201cMy travel agents were Hitler and Stalin.\u201d The atmosphere of violence and desperation continued after the war. Simic\u2019s father left the country for work in Italy, and his mother tried several times to follow, only to be turned back by authorities. When Simic was 15, his mother finally arranged for the family to travel to Paris. After a year, Simic sailed for America and a reunion with his father. The family moved to Chicago, where Simic attended high school and began to take a serious interest in poetry.\n\r\nSimic\u2019s first poems were published in 1959, when he was 21. Simic began college at the University of Chicago, but was drafted into the armed service in 1961. Simic finally earned his bachelor\u2019s degree from New York University in 1966. His first full-length collection of poems,\u00a0What the Grass Says,\u00a0was published the following year. In a very short time, Simic\u2019s work, including original poetry in English and translations of important Yugoslavian poets, began to attract critical attention. In\u00a0The American Moment: American Poetry in the Mid-Century,\u00a0Geoffrey Thurley noted that the substance of Simic\u2019s earliest verse\u2014its material referents\u2014\u201care European and rural rather than American and urban \u2026 The world his poetry creates\u2014or rather with its brilliant semantic evacuation decreates\u2014is that of central Europe\u2014woods, ponds, peasant furniture.\u201d The\u00a0Voice Literary Supplement\u00a0reviewer Matthew Flamm contended that Simic was writing \u201cabout bewilderment, about being part of history\u2019s comedy act, in which he grew up half-abandoned in Belgrade and then became, with his Slavic accent, an American poet.\u201d\n\r\nSimic\u2019s work defies easy categorization. Some poems reflect a surreal, metaphysical bent and others offer grimly realistic portraits of violence and despair. The\u00a0Hudson Review\u00a0contributor Vernon Young maintained that memory is the common source of all of Simic\u2019s poetry. \u201cSimic, a graduate of NYU, married and a father in pragmatic America, turns, when he composes poems, to his unconscious and to earlier pools of memory,\u201d the critic wrote. \u201cWithin microcosmic verses which may be impish, sardonic, quasirealistic or utterly outrageous, he succinctly implies an historical montage.\u201d Young elaborated: \u201cHis Yugoslavia is a peninsula of the mind...He speaks by the fable; his method is to transpose historical actuality into a surreal key \u2026[Simic] feels the European yesterday on his pulses.\u201d\n\r\nSome of Simic\u2019s best-known works challenge the dividing line between the ordinary and extraordinary. He animates and gives substance to inanimate objects, discerning the strangeness in household items as ordinary as a knife or a spoon.\u00a0Robert Shaw\u00a0wrote in the\u00a0New Republic\u00a0that the most striking perception of the author\u2019s early poems was that \u201cinanimate objects pursue a life of their own and present, at times, a dark parody of human existence.\u201d Childhood experiences of war, poverty, and hunger also lie behind a number of poems. In the\u00a0Georgia Review, Peter Stitt claimed that Simic\u2019s most persistent concern \u201cis with the effect of cruel political structures upon ordinary human life. \u2026 The world of Simic\u2019s poems is frightening, mysterious, hostile, dangerous.\u201d However, Stitt noted, Simic tempers this perception of horror with gallows humor and an ironic self-awareness: \u201cEven the most somber poems \u2026 exhibit a liveliness of style and imagination that seems to re-create, before our eyes, the possibility of light upon the earth. Perhaps a better way of expressing this would be to say that Simic counters the darkness of political structures with the sanctifying light of art.\u201d\n\r\nSimic\u2019s style has been the subject of much critical discussion. As Benjamin Paloff noted in his\u00a0Boston Review\u00a0piece on\u00a0The Voice at 3:00 A.M.: Selected Late and New Poems\u00a0(2008), Simic\u2019s work has been repeatedly described by a handful of adjectives: \u201cWords like \u2018inimitable,\u2019 \u2018surreal,\u2019 and \u2018nightmarish\u2019 have followed him around in countless reviews and articles.\u201d And though Simic\u2019s subjects are often surreal, evoking a dark Eastern Europe of the mind, his language is frank and accessible. As Paloff put it, \u201c[Simic\u2019s] predilection for brief, unembellished utterances lends an air of honesty and authority to otherwise perplexing or outrageous scenes.\u201d\u00a0Adam Kirsch, writing in the\u00a0New York Sun\u00a0described the remarkable assemblage of influences that has produced Simic\u2019s style: \u201cHe draws on the dark satire of Central Europe, the sensual rhapsody of Latin America, and the fraught juxtapositions of French Surrealism, to create a style like nothing else in American literature. Yet Mr. Simic\u2019s verse remains recognizably American\u2014not just in its grainy, hard-boiled textures, straight out of 1940s film noir, but in the very confidence of its eclecticism.\u201d\nInstantly recognizable, Simic\u2019s poetic style has changed little throughout the course of his career. For some critics, this opens his work to charges of stasis and, increasingly, self-imitation; but, as Ian Sampson noted in his\u00a0Guardian\u00a0review of\u00a0Selected Poems 1963-2003, Simic\u2019s \u201cwork reads like one big poem or project, a vast Simic-scape of \u2018eternal November.\u2019\u201d And\u00a0David Orr, reviewing\u00a0The Voice at 3:00 A.M.\u00a0in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review, agreed that \u201cthough many of the new poems here are interesting, almost all of them could easily have appeared 20 years ago.\u201d As with many readers and critics, however, this wasn\u2019t necessarily a problem for Orr: Simic\u2019s \u201crepetitiveness is a complicated matter,\u201d Orr wrote, \u201cbecause it\u2019s intimately related to the themes around which his poetry revolves. Simic can\u2019t quite believe in anything, and he can\u2019t quite not believe in anything; as a result, his irony and his romanticism can grind against each other in a tortured stasis. The sameness of some of his poetry can be explained, if not always excused, by this tendency.\u201d\nSimic has been incredibly prolific as a poet, translator, editor and essayist. He has translated the work of French, Serbian, Croatian, Macedonian and Slovenian poets, including\u00a0Tomaz Salamun\u00a0and Vasko Popa. He translated and edited the anthology\u00a0The Horse Has Six Legs: An Anthology of Serbian Poetry\u00a0(1992), regarded as the premier introduction to that country\u2019s contemporary poetry. In addition to poetry and prose poems, Simic has also written several works of prose nonfiction, including 1992\u2019s\u00a0Dime-Store Alchemy: The Art of Joseph Cornell.\u00a0A paean to one of the most innovative visual artists of the twentieth century, Simic\u2019s book highlights Cornell\u2019s work\u2014which included minimalist sculptures using found objects to create intriguing surrealist collages\u2014by creating verbal collages that are themselves composed of still smaller units of prose. \u201cAs in his poems, Simic\u2019s style in\u00a0Dime-Store Alchemy\u00a0is deceptively offhand and playful,\u201d noted\u00a0Edward Hirsch\u00a0in the\u00a0New Yorker,\u00a0\u201cmoving fluently between the frontal statement and the indirect suggestion, the ordinary and the metaphysical.\u201d Among Simic\u2019s essay collections are\u00a0Orphan Factory\u00a0(1997)\u00a0and the memoir A Fly in the Soup\u00a0(2000), which collected previously published autobiographical essays and fragments. Kirsch recommended the last, along with Simic\u2019s Selected Poems 1963-1983\u00a0(1984), to new readers for showing Simic\u2019s \u201cdark illuminations and acrid comedy in their most concentrated form.\u201d\nThough Simic\u2019s poetry has always been well received, his collections over the past 20 years have garnered even wider critical acclaim. His book of prose poems, The World Doesn't End, won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1990;\u00a0Walking the Black Cat\u00a0(1996) was a finalist for the National Book Award;\u00a0Jackstraws\u00a0(1999) was a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0Notable Book of the year and was glowingly reviewed; and Simic\u2019s\u00a0Selected Poems 1963-2003\u00a0(2004)\u00a0won the prestigious Griffin International Poetry Award. Other collections from this period like\u00a0Hotel Insomnia\u00a0(1992), Night Picnic: Poems\u00a0(2001),\u00a0and My Noiseless Entourage\u00a0(2005)\u00a0are also considered to be some of Simic\u2019s finest work. Reviewing\u00a0That Little Something: Poems\u00a0(2008)\u00a0for the\u00a0New York Times Book Review,\u00a0Katha Pollitt\u00a0noted that, though the collection was the poet\u2019s 19th, it included poems full of his \u201ccharacteristic ingredients, and they are as fresh as ever.\u201d Pollitt also pointed to the poems\u2019 continued \u201cestrangement from place, from the present moment,\u201d connecting it to \u201cpart of a more general sense of estrangement between the self and its circumstances.\u201d Pollitt, like Diana Engelmann of the\u00a0Antioch Review\u00a0and many others, saw Simic\u2019s personal history behind his project. Engelmann observed, \u201cWhile it is true that the experiences of Charles Simic, the \u2018American poet,\u2019 provide a uniquely cohesive force in his verse, it is also true that the voices of the foreign and of the mother tongue memory still echo in many poems.\u201d Engelmann concluded, \u201cSimic\u2019s poems convey the characteristic duality of exile: they are at once authentic statements of the contemporary American sensibility and vessels of internal translation, offering a passage to what is silent and foreign.\u201d\nDiscussing his creative process, Simic has said:\u00a0\u201cWhen you start putting words on the page, an associative process takes over. And, all of a sudden, there are surprises. All of a sudden you say to yourself, \u2018My God, how did this come into your head? Why is this on the page?\u2019 I just simply go where it takes me.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
