His father, an Italian immigrant, had shortened the family name upon arrival in America. When Ferlinghetti discovered the lengthier name as an adult, he took it as his own. He had a tumultuous youth, parts of which were spent in France, an orphanage in Chappaqua, New York, and in the mansion of the wealthy Bisland family in Bronxville, New York. He attended the elite Riverdale Country Day School, Mount Hermon, a preparatory academy in Massachusetts, and the University of North Carolina, where he majored in journalism.\u00a0Upon graduating, he joined the US\u00a0Navy. After his discharge, Ferlinghetti took advantage of the G.I. Bill to continue his education. He earned his MA from Columbia University in 1948, and completed his PhD at the University of Paris in 1951. He then moved to San Francisco, California, where played a key role in sparking the San Francisco literary renaissance of the 1950s and was essential to the establishment of the subsequent Beat movement. In 1998, he was named the first poet laureate of San Francisco.\nFerlinghetti\u2019s most famous collection, A Coney Island of the Mind (1958),\u00a0has sold well over one million copies in America and abroad. He is the author of over 30 other collections of poetry, including Time of Useful Consciousness (2012), Poetry as Insurgent Art\u00a0(2005), San Francisco Poems (2001), How to Paint Sunlight: Lyric Poems and Others, 1997\u20132000, A Far Rockaway of the Heart (1997), These Are My Rivers: New and Selected Poems, 1955\u20131993, and Endless Life: Selected Poems\u00a0(1981). Ferlinghetti\u2019s numerous awards and honors include the National Book Critics Circle\u2019s Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award, the Robert Frost Memorial Medal, and the National Book Foundation\u2019s Literarian Award, among others. He was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2003, and in 2007, he was named commandeur of the French Order of Arts and Letters.\nThroughout his career, Ferlinghetti has consistently challenged the status quo, asserting that art should be accessible to all people, not just a handful of highly educated intellectuals. His poetry engages readers, defies popular political movements, and reflects the influence of American idiom and modern jazz. In\u00a0Lawrence Ferlinghetti: Poet-at-Large,\u00a0Larry Smith noted that the author \u201cwrites truly memorable poetry, poems that lodge themselves in the consciousness of the reader and generate awareness and change. And his writing sings, with the sad and comic music of the streets.\u201d Smith observed that, from his earliest poems onward, Ferlinghetti writes as \u201cthe contemporary man of the streets speaking out the truths of common experience, often to the reflective beat of the jazz musician.\u201d Such sentiments found an appreciative audience among young people of the mid-20th century who were agonizing over the arms race and Cold War politics. New Pages\u00a0contributor John Gill asserted that reading a work by Ferlinghetti \u201cwill make you feel good about poetry and about the world\u2014no matter how mucked-up the world may be.\u201d\nIn 1953, two years after his arrival in San Francisco, Ferlinghetti partnered with Peter D. Martin to publish a magazine,\u00a0City Lights. In order to subsidize the publication, Martin and Ferlinghetti opened the City Lights Pocket Book Shop in a neighborhood on the edge of Chinatown. It became a popular gathering place for San Francisco\u2019s avant-garde writers, poets, and painters. The bookstore\u2019s publishing arm, the City Lights Pocket Poets series, offered a forum for Beat writers like\u00a0Allen Ginsberg,\u00a0Kenneth Patchen\u00a0and\u00a0Gregory Corso. Ferlinghetti\u2019s slim volume Pictures of the Gone World (1955) was the first publication in the series. By 1955, Ferlinghetti counted among his friends poets such as Kenneth Rexroth, Allen Ginsberg, and\u00a0Philip Whalen, as well as the novelist Jack Kerouac. Ferlinghetti was in the audience at the watershed 1955 poetry reading \u201cSix Poets at the Six Gallery,\u201d at which Ginsberg unveiled his poem \u201cHowl.\u201d Ferlinghetti immediately recognized it as a classic, and in 1956, he published the first edition of\u00a0Howl and Other Poems\u00a0in the Pocket Poets series. The collection sold out quickly, and the second shipment of the book\u2014seized by U.S. customs, then released\u2014occasioned the infamous Howl trial. The San Francisco Police Department arrested Ferlinghetti on charges of printing and selling lewd and indecent material. Ferlinghetti engaged the American Civil Liberties Union for his defense and welcomed his court case as a test of freedom of speech. He won the suit on October 3, 1957. The publicity generated by the case energized the San Francisco renaissance and Beat cause, and was vital in establishing definite principles to the various movements\u2019 often disparate aims.\nFerlinghetti aimed to redeem poetry from the ivory towers of academia and offer it as a shared experience with ordinary people. In an interview with the\u00a0San Francisco Chronicle\u00a0reporter Heidi Benson, Ferlinghetti explains why he prefers the use of the term \u201cwide-open\u201d to \u201cBeat\u201d in characterizations of his own work: \u201cWide-open poetry refers to what\u00a0Pablo Neruda\u00a0told me in Cuba in 1950 at the beginning of the Fidelista revolution: Neruda said, \u2018I love your wide-open poetry.\u2019 He was either referring to the wide-ranging content of my poetry, or, in a different mode, to the poetry of the Beats.\u201d\nIn 1958, New Directions press published Ferlinghetti\u2019s\u00a0A Coney Island of the Mind. In\u00a0Lawrence Ferlinghetti,\u00a0Smith suggested that, in\u00a0this collection, Ferlinghetti \u201cenlarged his stance and developed major themes of anarchy, mass corruption, engagement, and a belief in the surreality and wonder of life. \u2026 It was a revolutionary art of dissent and contemporary application which jointly drew a lyric poetry into new realms of social\u2014and self-expression. It sparkles, sings, goes flat, and generates anger or love out of that flatness as it follows a basic motive of getting down to reality and making of it what we can.\u201d\nTwo other collections of Ferlinghetti\u2019s poetry provide insight into the development of the writer\u2019s overarching style and thematic approach:\u00a0Endless Life: Selected Poems\u00a0(1981) and\u00a0These Are My Rivers: New and Selected Poems, 1955-1993.\u00a0The poems in\u00a0Endless Life\u00a0reflect the influences of E.E. Cummings, Kenneth Rexroth, and Kenneth Patchen, and are concerned with contemporary themes, such as the antiwar and antinuclear movements. In Western American Literature, John Trimbur noted that Ferlinghetti writes a \u201cpublic poetry to challenge the guardians of the political and social status quo for the souls of his fellow citizens.\u201d\u00a0Joel Oppenheimer\u00a0praised him in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review,\u00a0contending that he \u201clearned to write poems, in ways that those who see poetry as the province of the few and the educated had never imagined.\u201d Ferlinghetti focuses on current political and sexual matters in\u00a0These Are My Rivers\u00a0(1993).\u00a0As Rochelle Ratner noted in\u00a0Library Journal,\u00a0the poems are experimental in technique, often lacking common poetic devices such as stanza breaks, and they appear in unusual ways on the page, \u201cwith short lines at the left margin or moving across the page as hand follows eye.\u201d Ashley Brown, who, in\u00a0World Literature Today, called Ferlinghetti \u201cthe foremost chronicler of our times,\u201d commented,\u00a0\u201cFerlinghetti writes in a very accessible idiom; he draws on pop culture and sports as much as the modern poets whom he celebrates.\u201d\nFerlinghetti has also published acclaimed fiction. His most recent novel is Little Boy (2019), which Ron Charles describes as \u201ca volcanic explosion of personal memories, political rants, social commentary, environmental jeremiads and cultural analysis\u201d in the Washington Post. Ferlinghetti\u2019s widely celebrated novel\u00a0Love in the Days of Rage\u00a0(1988) takes place in Paris in 1968, during the student revolution; it chronicles a love affair between an expatriate American painter and a Portuguese banker and anarchist. Alex Raksin, discussing\u00a0Love in the Days of Rage\u00a0in the\u00a0Los Angeles Times Book Review,\u00a0praised the work as an \u201coriginal, intense novel\u201d in which Ferlinghetti\u2019s \u201csensitivity as a painter \u2026 is most apparent.\u201d Patrick Burson, critiquing it for the\u00a0San Francisco Review of Books,\u00a0explained that the book \u201cchallenges the reader on several stylistic levels as it attempts to mirror the anarchistic uprising of \u201968 which briefly united intellectuals, artists, and proletariats in common cause.\u201d Ferlinghetti\u2019s first novel,\u00a0Her\u00a0(1960), is an autobiographical, experimental work that focuses on the narrator\u2019s pursuit of a woman.\nFerlinghetti\u2019s often short, surrealistic plays have been performed in theaters in San Francisco, and he has exhibited paintings and drawings in numerous galleries.\nHe lives in San Francisco, where a street is named in his honor.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"], "School/Period:": ["Beat"]}}
