Maas earned a BA from Long Island University and received Poetry magazine\u2019s Guarantors Prize in 1938. He published two collections of poetry: Fire Testament (1935) and Concerning the Young (1938) before beginning a career as an experimental film maker with a series of \u201cfilm poems.\u201d During World War II, Maas served as a private in the U.S. Army, and afterward returned to live in New York City, where he was active in the art scene. It is possible that Maas and his wife, filmmaker Marie Menken, may have been a part of the inspiration for the married couple in Edward Albee's play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1962).\u00a0\nMaas was considered by filmmaker Jonas Mekas to be \u201cone of the important pioneers of the avant-garde film\u201d and artist Andy Warhol\u2014who was friends with Maas\u2014considered him to be \u201cthe last of the great bohemians.\u201d After a career teaching English at Wagner College, Maas died in 1971.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
