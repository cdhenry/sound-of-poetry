While Baudelaire\u2019s contemporary Victor Hugo\u00a0is generally\u2014and sometimes regretfully\u2014acknowledged as the greatest of 19th-century French poets, Baudelaire excels in his unprecedented expression of a complex sensibility and of modern themes within structures of classical rigor and technical artistry. Baudelaire is distinctive in French literature also in that his skills as a prose writer virtually equal his ability as a poet. His body of work includes a novella, influential translations of the American writer Edgar Allan Poe, highly perceptive criticism of contemporary art, provocative journal entries, and critical essays on a variety of subjects. Baudelaire\u2019s work has had a tremendous influence on modernism, and his relatively slim production of poetry in particular has had a significant impact on later poets. More than a talent of 19th-century France, Baudelaire is one of the major figures in the literary history of the world.\nThe extent of the influence of Baudelaire\u2019s family background on his life and work has been the subject of some interest to critics. In his life-story there are classic ingredients for neurosis, and his adult life was shaped by a triangle of family relations that some believe explains his complicated psyche. Baudelaire\u2019s father, Fran\u00e7ois Baudelaire (1759\u20131827), came from a family of woodworkers, winegrowers, farm laborers, and craftsmen who had lived near the Argonne forest since the 17th century. He went to Paris on a scholarship and in the course of a long career there became a priest; worked as a tutor for the children of Count Antoine de Choiseul-Praslin, even composing a manual to teach Latin; resigned his priesthood during the Reign of Terror; married Rosalie Janin, a painter, and had a son, Alphonse Baudelaire (1805\u20131862); earned a living as a painter; and from the age of thirty-eight until retirement worked his way up the ranks of the civil service.\nFran\u00e7ois Baudelaire was 60 when he married the 26-year-old Caroline Dufayis (1793\u20131871) in 1819; Charles was their only child, born in Paris on April 9, 1821. Caroline was an orphan: her mother, who came from a family of solicitors from the same part of France as the Baudelaires, died in England, where she had emigrated for unknown reasons; little is known about Caroline\u2019s father except that his name was Charles Dufayis and that he was supposed to have died in July 1795 at Quiberon Bay in southern Brittany when Revolutionary forces put down a peasant revolt aided by \u00e9migr\u00e9s. It is not known whether or not the difference in his parents\u2019 ages affected their son, but Baudelaire was just six when his father died, so he had no opportunity to know his father well. The death of Fran\u00e7ois Baudelaire, though, set the scene for several major dramas in Baudelaire\u2019s life: his inheritance at 21 of a respectable fortune; the establishment of a board of guardians that was to control Baudelaire\u2019s financial fortunes for most of his adult life; and the remarriage of his mother to Jacques Aupick, a man with whom Baudelaire could not get along.\nAupick (1779?\u20131857), like Caroline Dufayis, was an orphan. His father was an Irishman who died in the military service in France; his mother, who might or might not have been his father\u2019s legal wife, died shortly afterward. The young Aupick made his way successfully in the military: with no real family advantages, he was a general by the end of his life, and he had served as the head of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique (Polytechnic School) in Paris, as ambassador to Constantinople as well as to Spain, and as a senator. Caroline Dufayis Baudelaire met Aupick at the beginning of 1828, a year into her widowhood, and they were married rather precipitously on November 8, 1828, probably because of the stillborn child born a month later. Aupick was transferred to Lyon in December 1831, and in January 1836 he was transferred back to Paris, where he stayed until 1848, when he was sent as a diplomat to Constantinople.\nIt is understandable that Baudelaire might be jealous of his mother\u2019s new husband, as he was deeply attached to his mother both materially and emotionally. Their close relationship was of enduring significance, for during the course of his life he borrowed from his mother an estimated total of 20,473 francs and much of what is known of his later life comes from his extended correspondence with her. Although quite possibly Baudelaire\u2019s attachment to his mother did lead to his resentment and dislike of his stepfather, it is interesting to note that he did not manifest resentment early on. As a schoolboy in Lyons from 1832 to 1836 Baudelaire\u2019s letters to his parents were mostly affectionate and he referred to Aupick as his father. Easy relations within the family persisted through Baudelaire\u2019s high-school years at Louis-le-Grand in Paris, where Colonel Aupick had been transferred. Far from being \u201cmaudit\u201d (cursed) in the tradition of his later legend, Baudelaire was actually a prize student of whom both parents were proud. Even when he was expelled from Louis-le-Grand in 1839 for refusing to give up a note passed him by a classmate, stepfather and stepson appeared to be on good terms.\nBaudelaire began referring to his stepfather as \u201cthe General\u201d (Aupick had been promoted in 1839) in 1841, around the time his family contrived to send the young man on a voyage to the Indian Ocean. After passing the \u201cbac,\u201d or baccalaur\u00e9at (high-school degree), in 1839, several months after his expulsion from the lyc\u00e9e, Baudelaire spent two years in the Latin Quarter pursuing a literary career and, of particular concern to Aupick, accumulating debts. To save Baudelaire from his debts, a family council was called in which it was decided to send him on a long voyage in June of 1841, paid for from his future inheritance (the parents later agreed to pay for it themselves as a gesture of goodwill). Baudelaire did not want to go, and in fact he jumped ship at the Ile Bourbon, returning to Paris in February of 1842. If the stiff forms of address in his letters of this time are any indication, Baudelaire resented his family\u2019s intervention in his way of life and held his stepfather responsible for it.\nFamilial censure only became more institutionalized. By June of 1844 Baudelaire had spent nearly half of the capital of the 99,568 francs he had inherited two years before. The family decided that it was necessary to seek a conseil judiciaire (legal adviser) to protect the capital from Baudelaire, and on September 21, 1844 the court made Narcisse D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Ancelle, a lawyer, legally responsible for managing Baudelaire\u2019s fortune and for paying him his \u201callowance.\u201d The sum paid him was enough for a single young man to live on comfortably, but Baudelaire had expensive tastes and he was bitter about this intervention for the rest of his life. Relations among family members soured. Baudelaire could no longer bear to be around \u201cthe General\u201d and there were long periods of time when Mme Aupick was not permitted to see her son. For the next 15 years Baudelaire\u2019s letters to his mother are laced with reproach, affection, and requests for money, and it was only after her husband\u2019s death\u2014in 1857, the year of the publication of Les Fleurs du mal (The Flowers of Evil)\u2014that relations between mother and son began to improve.\nFinancial constraint, alienation, and complex emotions defined Baudelaire\u2019s life, and it is against this backdrop of complicated family relations that some of the best poetry in the French language was written. Though Baudelaire\u2019s interest in verse was manifest as early as his days in the lyc\u00e9e, his public emergence as a poet was slow and complicated by many sideline activities through the early 1850s.\nBaudelaire began making literary connections as soon as he passed the bac, at the same time that he was amassing debts. From 1839 to 1841, while he was living in the Latin Quarter, he became associated with the \u00c9cole Normande (Norman School), a group of student-poets centered around Gustave Levavasseur, Philippe de Chennevi\u00e8res, and Ernest Prarond. None of these people became major poets, but they were involved in Baudelaire\u2019s first ventures with poetry. Prarond claims to have heard Baudelaire recite as early as 1842 some of the poems that were later published in Les Fleurs du mal. Baudelaire considered participating in a collective publication with Levavasseur, Prarond, and another person named Dozon. He withdrew his contribution, however, because Levavasseur wanted to correct the \u201cidiosyncrasies\u201d in his work. Baudelaire was never without literary acquaintances. His professional social activity continued throughout his life, and in the course of his literary career he became acquainted with writers such as Victor Hugo,\u00a0Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve, and Th\u00e9ophile Gautier. As his rejection of Levavasseur\u2019s corrections suggested, though, Baudelaire\u2014like the speakers in his poetry\u2014was always an individual within the crowd.\nBaudelaire\u2019s first publications of poetry were probably disguised, for reasons known only to himself. 11 poems published between 1844 and 1847 in L\u2019Artiste under the name of Privat d\u2019Anglemont\u2014another friend in Baudelaire\u2019s literary circle\u2014have been attributed to Baudelaire, and in fact nine of these poems have been included in the definitive Pl\u00e9iade edition of Baudelaire\u2019s collected works published 1975\u20131979. The first poem published under Baudelaire\u2019s own name appeared in L\u2019Artiste on May 25, 1845; Baudelaire probably wrote the sonnet \u201cA Une Dame Cr\u00e9ole\u201d (To a Creole Lady), which celebrates the \u201cpale\u201d and \u201chot\u201d coloring of the lovely Mme Autard de Bragard, on his trip to the Indian Ocean. The poem is not a prodigious showing for someone who was already establishing a reputation for himself in Parisian circles as a poet, and Baudelaire\u2019s next official publication of verse did not take place until a full six years later, in 1851.\nIn De quelques \u00e9crivains nouveaux (On Some New Writers, 1852) Prarond described Baudelaire as a poet who had achieved a certain reputation without having published a verse. Although the statement was not technically accurate in 1852, it illustrates a facet of Baudelaire\u2019s reputation. Even though he had no record of solid achievements, Baudelaire, with his compelling personality, had the ability to impress others, and he was already deliberately cultivating his image with eccentric stories designed to shock and test his acquaintances. For example, he liked to recite to friends his poem \u201cNightmare,\u201d which features a man who witnesses the rape of his mistress by an entire army.\nEarly in his career Baudelaire\u2019s reputation was more solidly based on his nonpoetic publications. In 1847 he published his only novella, La Fanfarlo, an autobiographically based work that features a tortured hero named Samuel Cramer. He wrote a handful of essays and reviews for various journals, notably Le Corsaire Satan; these works\u2014including Le Mus\u00e9e classique du bazar Bonne-Nouvelle (The Classical Museum of the Bonne-Nouvelle Bazaar) and Comment on paie ses dettes quand on du g\u00e9nie (How to Pay Your Debts When You\u2019re a Genius)\u2014were collected in Curiosit\u00e9s esth\u00e9tiques (Esthetic Curiosities, 1868) as well as L\u2019Art romantique (Romantic Art, 1868), the second and third volumes in the posthumously published Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes (Complete Works, 1868\u20131873). Baudelaire also wrote two of the Salons that contribute to his reputation as a discerning, sometimes prophetic, and often amusing critic. Although Salon de 1845 (1845) went unnoticed by critics, the next year his Salon de 1846 made a good impression on a small circle.\nAlthough he does not develop an aesthetic theory in Salon de 1845, Baudelaire does launch his idea that heroism can exist in life\u2019s ordinary details. The essay notably displays a particularly charming feature of Baudelaire\u2019s critical writing: the sharp and colorful illustration of points. The works of one painter, for example, are witheringly dismissed: \u201cchaque ann\u00e9e les ram\u00e8ne avec leurs m\u00eames d\u00e9sesp\u00e9rantes perfections\u201d (each year brings them back with the same depressing perfections); another painter\u2019s works, writes Baudelaire, recall the pictures of travel brochures and evoke a China \u201co\u00f9 le vent lui-m\u00eame, dit H. Heine, prend un son comique en passant par les clochettes;\u2014et o\u00f9 la nature et l\u2019homme ne peuvent pas se regarder sans rire\u201d (where the wind itself, says H. Heine, sounds comical as it blows through bells; and where nature and man cannot look at each other without laughing).\nIn the important Salon de 1846 Baudelaire critiques particular artists and in a more general way lays the groundwork for the ideas about art that he continued to develop in his \u201cSalon de 1859,\u201d first published in Revue fran\u00e7aise in June and July of that year, and up until his essay \u201cLe Peintre de la vie moderne\u201d (The Painter of Modern Life), which appeared in Le Figaro in November and December of 1863. As Baudelaire defines it in Salon de 1846, art represents an ideal for Baudelaire: \u201cL\u2019art est un bien infiniment pr\u00e9cieux, un breuvage rafra\u00eechissant et r\u00e9chauffant, qui r\u00e9tablit l\u2019estomac et l\u2019esprit dans l\u2019\u00e9quilibre naturel de l\u2019id\u00e9al\u201d (Art is an infinitely precious thing, a warming and refreshing drink which reestablishes stomach and spirit in the natural equilibrium of the ideal). Although art leads to an abstraction, \u201cl\u2019id\u00e9al,\u201d the references to stomach and drink indicate that for Baudelaire the ideal is built on concrete particulars. Indeed, as he goes on to explain in Salon de 1846 \u201cAinsi l\u2019id\u00e9al n\u2019est pas cette chose vague, ce r\u00eave ennuyeux et impalpable qui nage au plafond des acad\u00e9mies; un id\u00e9al, c\u2019est l\u2019individu redress\u00e9 par l\u2019individu, rconstruit et rendu par le pinceau ou le ciseau \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9clatante v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de son harmonie native\u201d (Thus the ideal is not the vague thing, that boring and intangible dream which swims on the ceilings of academies; an ideal is the individual taken up by the individual, reconstructed and returned by brush or scissors to the brilliant truth of its native harmony).\nAt the time he wrote Salon de 1846 Baudelaire believed that Romanticism represented the ideal, and he presents the painter Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix as the best artist in that tradition. Baudelaire, though, also articulates principles that later took him beyond Romanticism to a more radical view of art. He propounds that beauty must contain the absolute and the particular, the eternal and the transitory, and in a section of Salon de 1846 titled \u201cDe l\u2019H\u00e9ro\u00efsme de la Vie Moderne,\u201d (The Heroism of Modern Life) he elaborates that the \u201cparticulier\u201d can be found in contemporary and ordinary urban life: \u201cLe spectacle de la vie \u00e9l\u00e9gante et des milliers d\u2019existences flottantes qui circulent dans les souterrains d\u2019une grande ville,\u2014criminels et filles entretenues,\u2014la Gazette des Tribuneaux et le Moniteur nous prouvent que nous n\u2019avons qu\u2019\u00e0 ouvrir les yeux pour conna\u00eetre notre h\u00e9ro\u00efsme\u201d (The spectacle of elegant life and of the thousands of existences which float in the underground of a big city\u2014criminals and kept women\u2014the Gazette des Tribuneaux and the Moniteur prove that we have only to open our eyes in order to recognize our heroism). Modern life as inspiration for art is an idea that Baudelaire develops in \u201cLe Peintre de la vie moderne\u201d with reference to the artist Constantin Guys. As Baudelaire observes in 1846, Delacroix works in the grand tradition, and a new tradition has not yet come into being.\nDespite several halfhearted attempts to indulge his parents\u2019 desire for his settled employment, throughout the 1840s Baudelaire was committed to his vocation as a poet, and as an artist he did his best to absorb the \u201cspectacle\u201d of Parisian life by living the life of a bohemian and a dandy. After the naming of the conseil judiciaire he affirmed a new identity by changing his name to Baudelaire-Dufayis, adding his mother\u2019s maiden name to his father\u2019s family name (this gesture lasted until the Revolution of 1848). He was particular about his dress, and virtually every contemporary description of him describes his changing hairstyles, from flowing locks to a shaved head to short, clipped hair. Early in the decade he took up with Jeanne Duval, the mulatto mistress with whom he had a long and complicated affair; in the late 1840s he met Marie Daubrun, the second inspiration for the three love cycles of his poetry. He had already had a bout with gonorrhea by this time and had picked up syphilis, the disease that was probably the cause of his death. Baudelaire attempted suicide once, on June 30, 1845. He cultivated an interest in art and painting, which fueled his continued accumulation of debts\u2014he was a generally unlucky but enthusiastic collector. He began a pattern of moving from hotel to hotel to escape creditors and was well acquainted with the seamy side of Paris, a familiarity that is evident in his poems.\nThe year 1848 marked the beginning of a strange period in Baudelaire\u2019s life, one that does not quite fit with his life as a dandy, and which he himself later labeled \u201cMon ivresse de 1848\u201d (My frenzy in 1848) in his Journaux intimes (Intimate Journals, 1909). Baudelaire\u2014the product of a bourgeois household, the elitist poet of refined and elegant dress, the man who in the 1850s embraced Count Joseph de Maistre, an ultra-royalist aristocrat, and who had already expressed admiration for the aristocratic views of Edgar Allan Poe\u2014participated in the French Revolution of 1848 that lead to the overthrow of the constitutional monarchy.\nAs Richard Burton documents extensively in Baudelaire and the Second Republic: Writing and Revolution (1988), Baudelaire did have strong revolutionary sympathies during this period. He was influenced by thinkers such as Fran\u00e7ois Marie Charles Fourier, F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Lamennais, and Emanuel Swedenborg. His dedication of Salon de 1846 to the \u201cbourgeois\u201d may well have been intended as ironic. Baudelaire wrote a positive and approving preface for Pierre Dupont\u2019s Chant des ouvriers (Song of the Workers, 1851), which praises the working man. He sought out Pierre-Joseph Prudhon, one of the great writers and thinkers of the 1848 revolution. With Champfleury, a journalist, novelist, and theoretician of the realist movement, he started a short-lived revolutionary newspaper after the provisional government was established. Most dramatically, he physically participated in the revolutions of February and June, actually fighting on a barricade and, according to some contemporaries\u2019 accounts, apparently shouting, \u201cIl faut aller fusiller le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Aupick\u201d (We must go shoot General Aupick).\nAlthough a school of criticism has grown up in which Baudelaire is labeled a revolutionary, it would be a mistake to reduce the life and thought of this complex man to political dogma. Baudelaire was undeniably fervent, but this fervor must be seen in the spirit of the times: the 19th-century Romantic leaned toward social justice because of the ideal of universal harmony but was not driven by the same impulse that fires the Marxist egalitarian. It is also possible, given Baudelaire\u2019s relationship with his stepfather and his famous cry on the barricades, that at least part of his zeal was motivated by personal feelings. Furthermore, even during this heady period Baudelaire never lost his critical acumen and spirit of contradiction. He rose repeatedly during speeches for the May 4 elections to interrupt idealistic speakers with pointed, embarrassing questions. In Mon coeur mis \u00e0 nu et Fus\u00e9es; journaux intimes (My Heart Laid Bare and Fus\u00e9es; Intimate Journals, 1909) he elaborates on the \u201civresse de 1848\u201d: \u201cDe quelle nature \u00e9tait cette ivresse? Go\u00fbt de la vengeance. Plaisir naturel de la d\u00e9molition (What was the nature of this drunkenness? A desire for vengeance. A natural pleasure in destruction).\nAfter Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in 1851, Baudelaire ceased all political activity. To the extent that he considered politics in his later years, his outlook was anti-egalitarian and anti-activist\u2014reminiscent of the aristrocratic conservatism represented by Poe and de Maistre, in other words: \u201cThere is no form of rational and assured government save an aristocracy. ... A monarchy or a republic based upon democracy are equally absurd and feeble.\u201d For the most part, though, Baudelaire\u2019s Intimate Journals reveal his relative lack of interest in politics, his disillusionment with mankind and all of its institutions, and his ultimate faith in the classless aristocracy of the \u201cDandy.\u201d\nAfter a long period of incubation, of familial reproaches that he had wasted his life, and of a reputation based on potential, a few publications, and force of personality, Baudelaire came into his own as a literary personage in the 1850s. On 9 April 1851 eleven poems were published in the Messager de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e under the title \u201cLes Limbes\u201d (Limbo); these poems were later included in Les Fleurs du mal. In March and April 1852 Baudelaire\u2019s first major study of Poe was published in Revue de Paris. In \u201cEdgar Allan Poe, sa vie et ses ouvrages\u201d (Edgar Allan Poe, His Life and His Works) Baudelaire notes views that were probably influenced by de Maistre as well as brought out by Poe: belief in original sin; faith in the imagination, which Baudelaire called \u201cla reine des facult\u00e9s\u201d (the queen of faculties); approval of the cult of Beauty and of poetry for its own sake; and hatred for progress and nature.\nIn 1854 and 1855 Baudelaire\u2019s first translations of Poe\u2019s writings were published in Le Pays. A meticulous translator, Baudelaire was known to hunt down English-speaking sailors for maritime vocabulary. His translations of Poe culminated in Histoires extraordinaires (1856; Tales of Mystery and Imagination), which included \u201cEdgar Allan Poe, sa vie et ses ouvrages\u201d as a preface; Nouvelles Histoires extraordinaires (1856; New Tales of Mystery and Imagination); Aventures d\u2019Arthur Gordon Pym (1858; originally published as The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, 1838); Eureka (1863; originally published 1848); and Histoires grotesques et s\u00e9rieuses (1865; originally published as Tales of Grotesque and Arabesque, 1840).\nAlso in 1855 the Revue des deux mondes published eighteen poems with the title of Les Fleurs du mal. Two of Baudelaire\u2019s prose poems were published for the first time that same year in a festschrift, \u201cHommage \u00e0 C. F. Denecourt.\u201d The festschrift publication is particularly interesting because the prose poems were published alongside two poems in verse, so that \u201cCr\u00e9puscule du Soir\u201d (Dusk) appeared in verse and in prose.\nIn June of 1857 the first edition of Les Fleurs du mal was published by the fine letter press of Auguste Poulet-Malassis. Although Baudelaire considered publishing Les Fleurs du mal with the large printing house of Michel L\u00e9vy, which published his translations of Poe, he chose the smaller press of Poulet-Malassis out of a concern for quality. A tyrannical author, Baudelaire took rooms near the offices of his publishers so that he could better supervise the placement of every comma. The press was solicitous of Baudelaire\u2019s corrections, and Poulet-Malassis became a devoted friend: he lent Baudelaire large sums of money though he himself eventually went bankrupt and to debtor\u2019s prison for his own debts; he tended to Baudelaire during his last days in Brussels, though the writer had signed over Poulet-Malassis\u2019s legal rights on some works to the publisher Hetzel; and when on his deathbed Baudelaire chose L\u00e9vy to publish his Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes , Poulet-Malassis loyally rallied to the cause, ceding his legally exclusive rights to Baudelaire\u2019s works and doing what he could to help produce a satisfactory edition.\nAbout one month after Les Fleurs du mal went on sale in July 1857, a report was drawn up by the S\u00fbret\u00e9 Publique (Public Safety) section of the Ministry of the Interior stating that the collection was in contempt of the laws that safeguard religion and morality. Thirteen poems were singled out and put on trial. In contrast with the last time he went to court, when he acquiesced to the imposition of a conseil judiciaire, Baudelaire fought this battle to the last. The proceeding betrays some of the misunderstandings that have infected views of his poetry ever since.\nTo intercede with the government on his behalf Baudelaire made the unfortunate choice of Agla\u00e9 Sabatier, \u201cla Pr\u00e9sidente,\u201d a woman to whom he had been sending anonymous and admiring poems since 1852. The third muse for the trilogy of love cycles in Les Fleurs du mal, \u201cApollonie\u201d (as she was also known) was without great political influence, and her dubious social standing probably did not lend credibility to Baudelaire\u2019s claims for morality. Baudelaire\u2019s defense at the trial was threefold: that he had presented vice in such a way as to render it repellent to the reader; that if the poems are read as part of the larger collection, in a certain order, their moral context is revealed; and that his predecessors\u2014Alfred de Musset, Pierre-Jean B\u00e9ranger, George Sand, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac\u2014had written far more scandalously and gotten away with it. Baudelaire\u2019s lawyer unwisely emphasized the last point, which was easily dismissed: that others have gotten away with transgression does not justify one\u2019s own. Six of the poems were condemned\u2014the ban on them was not lifted until after World War II, on 31 May 1949\u2014and both Baudelaire and his editors were fined.\nThough the trial was an ordeal and certainly did not help improve the poet\u2019s relations with his mother (General Aupick was dead by this time), the trial was not ultimately detrimental to Baudelaire. The condemned poems were excised, and the book went back on sale. Baudelaire subsequently achieved a certain notoriety, for better and for worse. For the better, Les Fleurs du mal got good reviews from critics that counted. Emile Deschamps, a founding father of 1830s Romanticism, published a poem in praise of the collection in Le Pr\u00e9sent . Gustave Flaubert, who had endured a similar trial for Madame Bovary (1857), wrote to Baudelaire on 13 July 1858 that \u201cVous avez trouv\u00e9 moyen de rajeunir le romantisme. Vous ne ressemblez \u00e0 personne (ce qui est la premi\u00e8re de toutes les qualit\u00e9s). ... Vous \u00eates r\u00e9sistant comme le marbre et p\u00e9n\u00e9trant comme un brouillard d\u2019Angleterre\u201d (You have found a way to inject new life into Romanticism. You are unlike anyone else [which is the most important quality]. ... You are as resistant as marble and as penetrating as an English fog). On 30 August 1887 Hugo wrote to Baudelaire that his flowers of evil were as \u201cradiant\u201d and \u201cdazzling\u201d as stars. In contrast, the influential Sainte-Beuve maintained a significant silence. There were many negative reviews by lesser critics, but none that affected Baudelaire\u2019s reputation.\nFor the worse, Baudelaire\u2019s legend as a po\u00e8te maudit (cursed poet) exploded at this time, and Baudelaire, as always, contributed to this reputation by shocking people with elaborate eccentricities. He invited people over to see riding breeches supposedly cut from his father\u2019s hide, for example, or in the middle of a conversation casually asked a friend, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be agreeable to take a bath with me?\u201d It is difficult to sort out which stories about Baudelaire are true and which are fictive\u2014later on someone apparently thought that Baudelaire had actually gotten unreasonably angry with a poor window-glazier, misconstruing the prose poem \u201cLe Mauvais Vitrier\u201d (The Bad Glazier) as reality. Baudelaire\u2019s legend as a po\u00e8te maudit obscured his profound complexity, and Charles Asselineau\u2019s preface to Charles Baudelaire, sa vie et son oeuvre (Charles Baudelaire, His Life and Work, 1869), the first biography of the poet, only sealed his notorious image by passing on the more infamous anecdotes.\nAnother effect of the condemnation of Les Fleurs du mal is that the excision of six poems probably prompted Baudelaire to write the new and wonderful poems published in the collection\u2019s second edition of 1861. After the trial he experienced a surge of creative activity. In Baudelaire in 1859 (1988) Burton posits that this rebirth of energy had to do with a reconciliation with his mother. General Aupick had died in April of 1857, and in 1858 Baudelaire switched from the formal vous to the more intimate tu in addressing his mother. He wrote several of the important poems in the second edition\u2014including \u201cLe Voyage\u201d (The Voyage) and \u201cLa Chevelure\u201d (The Head of Hair)\u2014in 1859, during a long stay at Honfleur in the \u201cMaison Joujou\u201d (Playhouse) of his mother. Whatever the reason for this literary activity, Baudelaire wrote thirty-five new poems between 1857 and 1861, adding \u201cTableaux Parisiens\u201d to the already existing sections of Les Fleurs du mal and creating more or less the definitive version of the collection.\nBaudelaire\u2019s only collection of verse is composed of six sections: \u201cSpleen et Id\u00e9al\u201d (Spleen and the Ideal), \u201cTableaux Parisiens\u201d (Parisian Tableaus), \u201cLe Vin\u201d (Wine), \u201cFleurs du mal\u201d (Flowers of Evil), \u201cR\u00e9volte\u201d (Revolt), and \u201cLa Mort\u201d (Death). In the trial of his poems Baudelaire had argued that there was an \u201carchitecture\u201d that organized the meaning of his work, and this organizing principle has been the subject of debate among critics. There is certainly a progression from \u201cAu lecteur\u201d (To the Reader), the poem that serves as the frontispiece, to \u201cLe Voyage,\u201d the final poem.\n\u201cAu lecteur\u201d invites the reader into the collection by portraying regretful yet irresistible corruption and ennui while forcing the reader into complicity with its well-known conclusion: \u201c\u2014Hypocrite lecteur,\u2014mon semblable,\u2014mon fr\u00e8re!\u201d (Hypocritical reader, my mirror-image, my brother!). Intervening poems explore various facets of the poet\u2019s experience, many of which represent struggles with what Blaise Pascal called the \u201cgouffre\u201d (the abyss). \u201cLe Voyage\u201d surveys the disappointed hopes of speakers who have traveled far and wide only to find what \u201cAu lecteur\u201d had promised, \u201cUne oasis d\u2019horreur dans un d\u00e9sert d\u2019ennui\u201d (An oasis of horror in a desert of tedium). The final cry of this poem, \u201cNous voulons ... / Plonger ... / Au fond de l\u2019Inconnu pour trouver du nouveau\u201d (We want ... / To plunge ... / To the bottom of the Unknown in order to find something new), is addressed to death and is ambiguous: it either launches the collection\u2019s journey on a new course from that set in \u201cAu lecteur,\u201d thus possibly concluding Les Fleurs du mal on a note of optimism, or it ends the poem\u2019s quest in death. In either case, there is clearly a movement toward closure, and perhaps resolution, in Les Fleurs du mal. Reading the poems by following too rigorous a system would do injustice to them, however. Although there is a general sense of progression in Les Fleurs du mal, individual works do not always fit the pattern assigned to their part in the collection.\nIn similar fashion, though Baudelaire\u2019s legend glossed him as the satanic poet of ennui, sordid details, and forbidden sensuality, in fact his poetry treats a variety of themes with a range of perspectives. He does deal with topics that fueled his scandalous reputation. As \u201cAu lecteur\u201d promised, the collection is dominated by the poet\u2019s Catholic sense of original sin. \u201cLe Mauvais Moine\u201d (The Bad Monk), in the section \u201cSpleen et Id\u00e9al,\u201d describes the poet as a \u201cmauvais c\u00e9nobite\u201d (a bad monk) who is trapped in the \u201codious\u201d grave of his soul. Redemption, given this situation, appears hopeless: \u201c\u2018 moine fain\u00e9ant! Quand saurai-je donc faire / Du spectacle vivant de ma triste mis\u00e8re / Le travail de mes mains et l\u2019amour de mes yeux? (O lazy monk! When will I ever know how to turn / the living spectacle of my sad misery / into the work of my hands and love of my eyes?) Many poems echo this expression of futility for man\u2019s spiritual condition, especially in \u201cSpleen et Id\u00e9al\u201d and notably in the four \u201cSpleen\u201d poems (LXXV, LXXVI, LXXVII, LXXVIII) within that section. While some poems end without hope, however\u2014\u201cSpleen LXXVIII\u201d concludes with \u201catrocious\u201d Anxiety staking the poet\u2019s skull with a black flag\u2014others betray the desire to break out of imprisonment in sin. \u201cLe Mauvais Moine\u201d concludes by expressing that wish (\u201cWhen will I ever know how ... ?\u201d), though it is in the tenuous form of a question.\nFor Baudelaire, the love of Beauty and sensual love are two specific examples of man\u2019s capacity for original sin. In Les Fleurs du mal Beauty is a compelling but often terrible phenomenon described in terms of hard, lifeless matter. Even the woman of \u201cLe Serpent qui danse\u201d (The Snake Which Dances), a poem about movement, has eyes that are \u201cdeux bijoux froids o\u00f9 se m\u00eale / L\u2019or avec le fer\u201d (two cold jewels where / Gold mixes with iron), and Beauty of \u201cLa Beaut\u00e9\u201d (Beauty) is like \u201cun r\u00eave de pierre\u201d (a dream of stone) that inspires love \u201c\u00e9ternel et muet ainsi que la mati\u00e8re\u201d (as eternal and mute as matter). The power of this inhuman Beauty is terrible. \u201cLa Beaut\u00e9\u201d reduces the poet to a \u201cdocile\u201d lover who is virtually chained to his idol. \u201cHymne \u00e0 la Beaut\u00e9\u201d (Hymn to Beauty) concludes with the same helpless devotion to Beauty\u2019s powers of distraction and more explicitly articulates Beauty\u2019s dual nature: her look is \u201cinfernal et divin\u201d (infernal and divine), and the poet is so addicted that he does not care whether She comes from Heaven, Hell, or both.\nBaudelaire does not just treat Beauty as an abstract phenomenon; he also writes about individual women. Baudelaire\u2019s three love cycles reflect his experiences with three different women\u2014Duval, Daubrun, and Mme Sabatier\u2014and discussions of his love poems are often organized around the poems associated with each woman. It is not always clear, however, which poems are associated with whom.\nJeanne Duval was a mulatto and a sometime actress who, according to Baudelaire, did not understand and in fact undermined his poetry and whose attraction was powerfully physical. Baudelaire met Duval in the early 1840s and lived with her periodically, but by the late 1840s he was writing to his mother that life with her had become a duty and a torment. Nonetheless, it was not until 1856 that they broke up; the rupture was at her instigation, and even afterward Baudelaire continued to support her financially: as usual, his was not the conventional response to a situation.\nBaudelaire\u2019s relations with Marie Daubrun were less extended. She was a blonde, Rubenesque actress who seems never seriously to have reciprocated Baudelaire\u2019s fascination for her. Baudelaire had met her in the late 1840s or early 1850s but probably did not become intimately involved with her until around 1854. Their sporadic connection ended when Marie left Baudelaire to go back to Th\u00e9odore de Banville.\nApollonie Sabatier represented a different sort of attraction from that of Jeanne and Marie. \u201cLa Pr\u00e9sidente\u201d had been a model and the mistress of various men, one of whom left her a stipend that secured her independence. Her position as an independent woman who had a history with men placed her in the demimonde, the \u201chalf-world\u201d that is neither part of \u201cle monde,\u201d the world of social acceptability and prominence, nor part of the underworld of prostitutes. She was much admired as a tasteful, witty, intelligent woman, and her social evenings were attended by artists such as Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, Maxime Du Camp, Ernest Feydeau, and Flaubert. Baudelaire\u2019s feelings for Mme Sabatier started as admiration from afar: he sent her anonymous letters accompanied by poems. Eventually he revealed his identity to her. When she finally responded to him, however, he dropped her with a letter in which he tells her that her capitulation, whether it was physical or emotional, had turned her from a Goddess into \u201ca mere woman.\u201d Despite the direct stares of Nadar\u2019s famous photographs, Baudelaire\u2019s was a complex personality. On the one hand he experienced animal love and a sense of duty with Jeanne; on the other hand he felt platonic love for Mme Sabatier and yet he betrayed her. His relations with women were far from entirely pleasant.\nBaudelaire\u2019s complicated experiences with these women and with others undoubtedly shaped his poetry about them. Some readers view Baudelaire as a mere sensualist and in some poems he certainly does celebrate the sensuality of women, of scent, and of sensation, but it is important to note that his poetic descriptions of women are multidimensional. Although there are extremely sensual poems, such as \u201cParfum Exotique\u201d (Exotic Perfume), \u201cLa Chevelure\u201d (The Head of Hair), and \u201cL\u2019Invitation au Voyage\u201d (Invitation to a Voyage), Baudelaire also wrote poems, such as those dedicated to Beauty, in which a woman is admired as a hopelessly unattainable object of art\u2014\u201d Je t\u2019adore \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gal de la vo\u00fbte nocturne\u201d (I Adore You as the Vaulted Night Is High), for example, or \u201cAvec ses v\u00eatements ondoyants et nacr\u00e9s\u201d (With Her Undulating and Pearly Garments).\nIndeed, contrary to the stereotype of Baudelaire as a lustful idolater, in many of his sensual poems he alchemizes the physical elements of the woman into an ethereal substance. The ultimate importance of \u201cla chevelure\u201d is as a source of memories, and in \u201cParfum Exotique\u201d the initial scent of the woman\u2019s breast becomes the exotic perfume of an imaginary island. When Baudelaire idolizes the woman as a form of art, similarly, by the end of most poems the woman\u2019s body is conspicuous by its removal. In \u201cJe t\u2019adore \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gal de la vo\u00fbte nocturne\u201d the speaker tells the woman that he loves her \u201cd\u2019autant plus, belle, que tu me fuis\u201d (all the more, beautiful one, when you flee me). The image of \u201cla froide majest\u00e9 d\u2019une femme st\u00e9rile\u201d (the cold majesty of a sterile woman) in \u201cAvec ses v\u00eatements ondoyants et nacr\u00e9s\u201d does not invite embraces.\nFor Baudelaire, as for the English metaphysical poets, the human struggle starts with the flesh but ultimately takes place on the metaphysical plane. Woman, on this level, represents good or evil. Some poems portray the woman as demonic, in the tradition of \u201cHymne \u00e0 la Beaut\u00e9.\u201d In \u201cSed non Satiata\u201d (But she is Not Satisfied), the speaker cries to the woman: \u201c\u2018 d\u00e9mon sans piti\u00e9! verse-moi moins de flamme\u201d (O pitiless demon! Throw me less fire). \u201cLe Vampire\u201d (The Vampire) is about the symbiosis of the vampire woman and the enslaved poet. Other poems\u2014these are usually the ones associated with Mme Sabatier\u2014represent the woman as a redemptive angel against a somber background. The play between light and dark in these poems ranges from the simple to the complex. In \u201cReversibilit\u00e9\u201d (Reversibility) there is a simple counterpoint between the \u201cAnge plein de bonheur, de joie et de lumi\u00e8res\u201d (Angel full of happiness, of joy, and of lights) and the tortured speaker. A more complex interplay between light and dark occurs in \u201cAube Spirituelle\u201d (Spiritual Dawn) when the monstrance-like memory of the woman shines against a backdrop of the sun drowning in its congealing blood. Such complexity is again evident in \u201cConfession,\u201d when the \u201caimable et douce femme\u201d (amiable and sweet woman) confesses her \u201chorrible\u201d lack of faith in humanity.\nBehind Baudelaire\u2019s struggles with sin and ennui is an articulated awareness of Satan, notably in the section \u201cR\u00e9volte.\u201d \u201cLe Reniement de Saint Pierre\u201d (St. Peter\u2019s Denial) concludes with the speaker congratulating Peter for denying Jesus. In \u201cAbel et Ca\u00efn\u201d the narrative voice urges Cain to ascend to heaven and throw God to earth. \u201cLes Litanies de Satan\u201d (The Litanies of Satan) is addressed to Satan and has the refrain \u201c\u2018 Satan, prends piti\u00e9 de ma triste mis\u00e8re!\u201d (O Satan, have pity on my sad misery!). These are strong poems, understandably shocking to the readers of his day, but Baudelaire\u2019s struggles with evil do not ally him with Satan. In his poetry Baudelaire represents himself as trapped and cries out in a despair that suggests his awareness of sin as a burden. Baudelaire is not a diabolic preacher; with C. S. Lewis, he would point out that Satan is part of the Christian cosmology.\nBaudelaire\u2019s \u201cDoctrine of Correspondences\u201d suggests a belief of sorts in a pattern for the world and in relationships between the physical world and a spiritual one. This view, probably influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg and viewed as an antecedent to symbolism, is presented in the poem \u201cCorrespondances.\u201d Nature is presented as a \u201ctemple\u201d whose living pillars speak to man and whose \u201cforest of symbols\u201d (for\u00eat de symboles) observe him. Baudelaire writes that \u201cLes parfums, les couleurs, et les sons se r\u00e9pondent\u201d (Perfumes, colors, and sounds interact with each other) like echoes in a \u201ct\u00e9n\u00e9breuse et profonde unit\u00e9\u201d (dark and deep unity). Although he does not include a direct expression of faith in God or gods in the poem, Baudelaire\u2019s profoundly mystical belief in the world\u2019s fundamental unity is clear. \u201cCorrespondances\u201d epitomizes Baudelaire\u2019s complicated spirituality.\nIndeed, the subject of Baudelaire\u2019s faith has been much debated. The references to God and to Satan in his poems, letters, and intimate journals have been counted; the validity of his last rites has been weighed; his confession of faith to Nadar has been examined. Most critics agree that Baudelaire\u2019s preoccupations are fundamentally Christian but that in Les Fleurs du mal he fails to embrace entirely Jesus Christ and his power of redemption. Debates about Baudelaire\u2019s Christianity have not resolved the matter, though, nor is a label for Baudelaire\u2019s faith necessarily desirable for reading his poetry. Les Fleurs du mal is best read on its own terms, with a respect for its complexity. The constant thrust of the collection is to impart to the reader an awareness of tension between the physically real and the spiritually ideal, of a hopeless but ever-renewed aspiration toward the infinite from an existence mired in sin on earth. This thrust is evident in poems in which the speaker bemoans enslavement to the soul\u2019s \u201cgouffre\u201d (abyss) or to Beauty\u2019s fascinations, in which he cries out to Satan in rage, in which he delves into the sensual to escape the physical world, and in which he articulates a feeble hope in love\u2019s redemptive capacity and the possibility of unity.\nBaudelaire\u2019s ambiguous relationship with the material world and his desire for another world are evident in his poems about the city of Paris. While some critics, notably Edward Kaplan, have argued that \u201cTableaux Parisiens,\u201d the section added to the edition of 1861, shows a \u201cconversion to the real world as it exists,\u201d critics such as F. W. Leakey have pointed out that in these poems Baudelaire treats the city the way he treats the female body in \u201cJe t\u2019adore \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gal de la vo\u00fbte nocturne,\u201d that is, by moving away from it as a physical presence. \u201cPaysage\u201d (Landscape) invokes concrete details of Paris\u2014\u201dLes tuyaux, les clochers, ces m\u00e2ts de la cit\u00e9\u201d (the pipes, the bells, the masts of the city)\u2014but the poem concludes with the poet behind closed shutters, his head on his desk, resolving to make \u201cde mes pensers br\u00fblants une ti\u00e8de atmosph\u00e8re\u201d (a warm atmosphere from my burning thoughts).\nIn \u201cLe Soleil\u201d (The Sun) the poet walks the streets of Paris, but he appears to see the city as a literary text rather than on its physical terms. He goes \u201cFlairant dans tous les coins les hasards de la rime, / Tr\u00e9buchant sur les mots comme sur les pav\u00e9s\u201d (Seeking out the hazards of rhyme in all corners / Stumbling on words as on cobblestones). \u201cLe Cygne\u201d (The Swan) is a magnificent poem that records the changes wrought in Paris by the Baron Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann. Although he accumulates concrete details, Baudelaire again removes himself from the physical presence he is recording by recasting what he sees: \u201cJe ne vois qu\u2019en esprit tout ce camp de baraques . . .\u201d (I see all these barracks ... only in spirit) and \u201ctout pour moi devient all\u00e9gorie\u201d (everything becomes an allegory for me). Baudelaire\u2019s reputation as the father of modern poetry about cities is largely based on the \u201cTableaux Parisiens,\u201d which describe the streets of Paris in such gritty detail; the importance of these street scenes for the poet, though, is that he usually plunges into them with the desire to transcend them.\nBaudelaire\u2019s theory of correspondences and his introduction of such topics as the city and the ugly side of man\u2019s nature to poetry in verse are responsible for the modern quality of Les Fleurs du mal. Baudelaire also deals with a variety of themes in the Romantic tradition, however, including solitude; the mal de si\u00e8cle, which in Baudelaire\u2019s terms becomes ennui; the special plight of the poet; introspection; yearnings for the infinite; and romance. Furthermore, Baudelaire\u2019s prosody is traditional: his alexandrines are no more loosened than those of the Romantics, and he uses a wide variety of classical forms.\nEven in his treatment of Romantic themes, however, Baudelaire is radical for his time. He imagines solitude not as a state of nature but as it happens in cities, presenting it in counterpoint to city crowds. The person who experiences ennui, as opposed to mal de si\u00e8cle, is mercilessly self-aware and is troubled by original sin and a divided self. For Baudelaire the poet is endowed with special powers but is also a clumsy albatross (\u201cL\u2019Albatros\u201d) or slothful sinner (\u201cLe Mauvais Moine\u201d). No longer mournful meditation in picturesque settings, introspection turns ugly with Baudelaire, a guilty pleasure to be squeezed like \u201cune vieille orange\u201d (an old orange), as Baudelaire asserts in \u201cAu Lecteur.\u201d The infinite is no longer the divine perceived in stars; it is found in the expansiveness of scents, in the imagination, in poetry, in cold-hearted Beauty, in the desire to escape.\nTo traditional forms and traditional themes Baudelaire brought imagery and situations that had never before existed in French poetry. \u201cUne Charogne\u201d (A Cadaver) provides an excellent example of how Baudelaire uses Romantic and even classical themes to go beyond them. The poet takes a walk with his beloved and concludes that, although time passes, his poetry will immortalize her. Unlike Pierre de Ronsard\u2019s poem on that classical theme, \u201cQuand tu seras bien vielle\u201d (When You Are Very Old), however, Baudelaire\u2019s meditation is prompted by a human cadaver whose guts spill across the page, the poem graphically detailing the flies, vermin, and stink. The speaker instructs his beloved that when she, too, is a rotting corpse, she should tell the vermin\u2014who will eat her with kisses\u2014that \u201cj\u2019ai gard\u00e9 la forme et l\u2019essence divine / De mes amours d\u00e9compos\u00e9s!\u201d (I have maintained the form and divine essence / Of my decomposed loves!). Just as he exploits grotesque physical details only to extract from them an \u201cessence divine,\u201d so Baudelaire uses poetic convention while transforming it.\nSimilarly, Baudelaire\u2019s use and mastery of traditional technique revolutionized French poetry by so clearly representing a unique sensibility. In \u201cLe Cygne,\u201d a poem detailing the poet\u2019s thoughts as he walks through a changing Paris, Baudelaire sensitively communicates modern anxiety and a modern sense of displacement. The poem begins with an abrupt exclamation, \u201cAndromaque, je pense \u00e0 vous!\u201d (Andromache, I am thinking of you!). A series of repetitions compounds the initial sense of urgency. The frequent recurrence of the verb je pense \u00e0 (I am thinking about), though, also indicates the meditative nature of the poem; the repetition of words such as l\u00e0 (there)\u2014along with a myriad of sharp descriptions\u2014show that meditation interacts with the speaker\u2019s close observations. Syntax broken across stanzas conveys the reach of the poet\u2019s thoughts and observations as well as a sense of breathless haste.\nThe speaker returns to the same thoughts\u2014notably, a swan escaped from a zoo and Andromache, the wife of the Trojan hero Hector\u2014and the use of exclamation points is heavy: he is obsessed and slightly frantic. The gist of the speaker\u2019s meditations is that he is haunted by absences: by Paris as it is no longer, by the swan who has lost his native soil, by Andromache\u2019s losses. Those absences are present in this poem by virtue of Baudelaire\u2019s prosody. Andromache\u2019s fall into destitution is represented in the space caused by the enjambment between stanzas: \u201c \u2026 et puis [je pense] \u00e0 vous / Andromaque, des bras d\u2019un grand \u00e9poux tomb\u00e9e\u201d (And I think of you, / Andromache, fallen from the arms of a great husband). The lament of all who have suffered losses is emphasized by an enjambment that forces a quick draw of breath right before the end of the sentence and that accents the finality of \u201cjamais\u201d (never) at the beginning of the next sentence:\n\u00a0\n\u201cJe pense . . .\n. . . . . . . . . . . .\n\u00c0 quiconque a perdu ce qui ne se retrouve\nJamais, jamais!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(I think . . .\n. . . . . . . . . . .\nOf whomever has lost that which can\nNever, never be found again!).\n\u00a0\n\nIn Les Fleurs du mal traditional prosody and themes combine with novel thoughts and inspiration to create works of supreme originality.\n\r\nAlthough there were not many reviews of the second edition of Les Fleurs du mal and not all of those published were favorable, Baudelaire became an established poet with its publication. Saint-Beuve\u2014though he never did review Les Fleurs du mal\u2014ranked him grudgingly among the leaders of a new generation of poets as he remarked that poets coming along seemed to be in the style of Hugo, Gautier, Banville, and \u201ceven Baudelaire.\u201d Younger poets started to dedicate poems to Baudelaire. Charles Asselineau in Charles Baudelaire: Sa vie et son oeuvre (1869) describes Baudelaire as accepted and blossoming with success after 1861. On the strength of that success, in fact, Baudelaire attempted an application to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in 1861, seeking\u2014many thought ironically\u2014the place of Henri Lacordaire, a Roman Catholic priest. The taint of the trial and of his reputation was too strong, though, and Baudelaire thought it prudent to let his candidacy drop before he met with certain failure.\nIn the 1860s Baudelaire diversified from poetry in verse to literary activity in several different spheres. He wrote Les Paradis artificiels, Opium et Haschisch (The Artificial Paradise, Opium and Hashish, 1860), in which he resumes the interest in drugs that he had first explored in 1851 with Du Vin et du haschisch (On Wine and Hashish), an article published in Le Messager del\u2019Assembl\u00e9e. He also wrote seven articles for Jacques Cr\u00e9pet\u2019s Les Po\u00e8tes Fran\u00e7ais (French Poets, 1862), including pieces on Hugo, Gautier, and Marceline Desbordes-Valmore. These essays were published later along with others in Curiosit\u00e9s esth\u00e9tiques . The note on Baudelaire in Cr\u00e9pet\u2019s volume, written by Gautier, was fairly positive. This anthology established contact between Baudelaire and his first major biographer, Cr\u00e9pet.\nBaudelaire also continued with essay projects on topics of miscellaneous artistic interest, for example, the expression of his admiration for Wagner in 1861, Richard Wagner et \u201cTannh\u00e4user\u201d \u00e0 Paris, and a valedictory tribute to Delacroix in 1863. The most significant of these essays was his definitive article on modern art. Around 1859 Baudelaire met the sketch artist Constantin Guys and began writing \u201cLe Peintre de la vie moderne\u201d (The Painter of Modern Life). This essay, ultimately published in Le Figaro in 1863, brings to fruition his ideas about \u201cl\u2019h\u00e9ro\u00efsme de la vie moderne\u201d (the heroism of modern life) first expressed in Salon de 1845 and Salon de 1846. Where in the Salon de 1846 Baudelaire discusses the duality of art in general terms, in \u201cLe Peintre de la vie moderne\u201d that duality specifically defines art\u2019s modernity: \u201cLa modernit\u00e9, c\u2019est le transitoire, le fugitif, le contingent, la moiti\u00e9 de l\u2019art, dont l\u2019autre moiti\u00e9 est l\u2019\u00e9ternel et l\u2019immuable\u201d (Modernity is the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, half of art, the other half of which is eternal and immutable). Art is composed of the eternal and the contingent; modernity\u2014which can occur in every historic era\u2014is a function of finite particulars \u201cqui sera, si l\u2019on veut, tour \u00e0 tour ou tout ensemble, l\u2019\u00e9poque, la mode, la morale, la passion\u201d (which, if you like, will be one by one or simultaneously the era, fashion, morals, passion). Baudelaire illustrates these principles by discussing in detail the interests and techniques of \u201cCG,\u201d his designation for the artist who wished to remain anonymous, from his brush stroke to his Crimean War drawings for the Illustrated London News.\nCentral to Baudelaire\u2019s estimation of Guys is that Guys is not an artist but is, rather, a man of the world. For Baudelaire, a broad interest in the world as opposed to the restricted perspective that he associates with most \u201cartistes\u201d is crucial to interesting art. Along with this line of thought Baudelaire elaborates his notion of the dandy, who is not only the elegant dresser of usual associations but also a man of the world who lives according to the highest aesthetic principles. Baudelaire also develops his ideas about \u201cla foule,\u201d the crowd, which is the solitary artist\u2019s domain \u201cas water is for the fish.\u201d He devotes an entire section to the aspects of modern life that the true artist must absorb: military life, the dandy, cars, women, prostitutes, and even makeup.\nIn that last section, \u201cEloge du Maquillage\u201d (In Praise of Makeup), Baudelaire makes explicit two more concepts that are important to his ethos. First, true to the metaphysical import of flesh already described in his poetry, Baudelaire makes it clear that for him there is a spiritual dimension to physical rituals: he speaks of \u201cla haute spiritualit\u00e9 de la toilette\u201d (the high spirituality of the toilet) and states that fashion must be considered \u201cun sympt\u00f4me du go\u00fbt de l\u2019id\u00e9al\u201d (a symptom of a taste for the ideal). Second, as a corollary to the importance he attaches to fashion, makeup, and the codes of the dandy, Baudelaire touches on his unromantic distaste for the natural. Everything beautiful is beautiful by calculation, he opines. Art is necessary to correct the natural state of man, which on the physical level is unattractive and on the spiritual level is a state of original sin. By the early 1860s Baudelaire had found a model for his ideals in the person of Guys, and he gave full expression to his artistic aesthetic in \u201cLe Peintre de la vie moderne.\u201d\nBaudelaire continued with scattered publications of poetry in the 1860s. In 1862 he published 20 prose poems in La Presse . This landmark year marks a shift in his creative endeavors from poetry in verse to poetry in prose: thereafter most of his creative publications are prose poems. Baudelaire managed to write only fifty of the one hundred prose poems he had projected. These poems were posthumously collected in 1869 as Petits po\u00e8mes en prose (Little Poems in Prose) and published with Les Paradis artificiels; later they were published by the better known title Le Spleen de Paris, petits po\u00e8mes en prose (The Spleen of Paris, Little Poems in Prose, 1917). Le Spleen de Paris is, as Baudelaire would say, a \u201csingular\u201d assemblage of works that represents an extremely ambitious literary project. In his correspondence he refers to the prose poems as a \u201cpendant\u201d (a completion of) to Les Fleurs du mal. He explains in what senses Le Spleen de Paris completes Les Fleurs du mal when he articulates his ambitions for the prose poems in \u201cA Ars\u00e8ne Houssaye,\u201d a letter that became the preface to the collection. Houssaye was the editor of L\u2019Artiste and La Presse , which published some of the prose poems individually.\nIn \u201cA Ars\u00e8ne Houssaye\u201d Baudelaire is careful to point out that the main predecessor for the genre of prose poetry was Aloysius Bertrand\u2019s Gaspard de la Nuit (Gaspard of the Night, 1842), a relatively little-known work about gothic scenes in Paris. Bertrand did not label his short pieces \u201cprose poems,\u201d though: Baudelaire is the first poet to make a radical break with the form of verse by identifying nonmetrical compositions as poetry. Baudelaire offered a tantalizing statement about his goals for the new form: \u201cQuel est celui de nous qui n\u2019a pas, dans ses jours d\u2019ambition, r\u00eav\u00e9 le miracle d\u2019une prose po\u00e9tique, musicale sans rythme et sans rime, assez souple et assez heurt\u00e9e pour s\u2019adapter aux mouvements lyriques de l\u2019\u00e2me, aux ondulations de la r\u00eaverie, aux soubresauts de la conscience?\u201d (Who among us has not, in his days of ambition, dreamed the miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm or rhyme, supple and agile enough to adapt to the lyrical movements of the soul, to the undulations of daydreams, to the leaps of consciousness?).\nHaving mastered the forms of traditional verse, Baudelaire wanted to do nothing less than create a new language. Unlike Bertrand\u2019s \u201cpicturesque\u201d topics, Baudelaire associates his new language with the modern topic of the city. In \u201cA Ars\u00e8ne Houssaye\u201d he states that the ideal that obsesses him is born \u201csurtout de la fr\u00e9quentation des villes \u00e9normes, ... du croisement de leurs innombrables rapports\u201d (especially from frequenting large cities, ... from the interconnection of their innumerable points of relationship). In contrast with the \u201carchitecture\u201d of Les Fleurs du mal, these interconnections are presented without order. The work has \u201cni queue ni t\u00eate, puisque tout, au contraire, y est \u00e0 la fois t\u00eate et queue, alternativement et r\u00e9ciproquement\u201d (neither tail nor head because, on the contrary, everything is at once head and tail, alternately and reciprocally). Le Spleen de Paris is modern in that it represents a break with traditional form, is about urban life, and is consciously without order.\nIt is worth noting that in his preface Baudelaire refers to the form of the work as \u201cprose lyrique.\u201d He does not in the collection refer to the works as poems in prose, and the title, Le Spleen de Paris, petits po\u00e8mes en prose was chosen after Baudelaire\u2019s death by editors and critics. It is true that critics chose this title from titles that Baudelaire considered in his correspondence, and that in his correspondence Baudelaire most often refers to his endeavours as \u201cpo\u00e8mes en prose.\u201d Among the most significant challenges posed by Le Spleen de Paris, though, are the questions surrounding its form: is this poetry? Did Baudelaire succeed in his ambition to forge a new poetic language? In her classic tome on prose poetry Le Po\u00e8me en prose du Baudelaire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 nos jours (The Prose Poem from Baudelaire to the Present, 1959) Suzanne Bernard defined the important characteristics of the genre: \u201cl\u2019unit\u00e9, la gratuit\u00e9, la bri\u00e8vet\u00e9 (unity, gratuitousness, and brevity). Most critics have tended to discuss the themes of the poems rather than their form, however, accepting poetry in Baudelaire\u2019s wake as an attitude rather than a set of rules. This collection, which has been growing in popularity among critics, still contains much to be explored.\nBaudelaire\u2019s poems in prose are short anecdotes, bitter satires, and reveries about unusual topics, including dogs, mud, aged tumblers, windows, widows, and poor people standing outside fancy eating establishments. Several critics, notably Pierre Emmanuel, have noted that there is more compassion in these works than in Baudelaire\u2019s poetry in verse. This compassion can take strange forms\u2014the speaker of \u201cLes Yeux des pauvres\u201d (The Eyes of the Poor) is so moved by a family of poor people that he hates the companion he had loved for her lack of sympathy. \u201cAssommons les Pauvres\u201d (Let\u2019s Knock Out the Poor) concludes with the speaker sharing his purse with a beggar, but it is after having beaten him like \u201ccooks who want to tenderize a steak.\u201d\nIt is true, though, that whereas Baudelaire most often offers visions of beauty in Les Fleurs du mal, he commonly and sympathetically treats the poor in Le Spleen de Paris. In fact, the speaker in \u201cMademoiselle Bistouri\u201d concludes by praying to God\u2014as opposed to the devil\u2014to have pity on crazy people. Furthermore, while many of the prose poems are about ugliness, they often accept and possibly even transcend ugliness. \u201cUn cheval de race\u201d (A Thoroughbred) is about a woman well past her prime who is \u201cbien laide\u201d (very ugly) but \u201cd\u00e9licieuse pourtant\u201d (nonetheless beautiful). In \u201cPerte d\u2019aur\u00e9ole\u201d (The Lost Halo) the speaker loses his \u201chalo\u201d in the mud, but concludes that he is better off without it and that the halo is actually much better suited to \u201csome bad poet.\u201d\nWhile the speaker in the poems of Les Fleurs du mal sought escape, in the prose poem \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0!\u201d Baudelaire describes a speaker who had escaped on a boat that then returned to shore. At first he alone among the passengers is regretful, but in the last paragraph of the poem he celebrates \u201cla terre avec ses bruits, ses passions, ses commodit\u00e9s, ses f\u00eates;\u201d (earth with its sounds, its passions, its conveniences, its celebrations). As with Les Fleurs du mal, it would be a mistake to pigeonhole the poems in this collection, which unlike his first has no headings. There are some harsh, disturbing poems in Le Spleen de Paris \u2014\u201cLe G\u00e2teau\u201d (The Cake), for example, which is about a fratricidal war between two natives over a piece of cake. As critics have noticed from the very beginning, however, the prose poems address banalities and travails of life quite differently from Les Fleurs du mal.\nIt is not coincidental that Baudelaire\u2019s departure from traditional form and his exploring new themes occurred in chronological conjunction with \u201cLe Peintre de la vie moderne.\u201d Certainly, Baudelaire\u2019s break with traditional notions of poetry had a far-reaching effect on subsequent poetry, from Arthur Rimbaud\u2019s Les Illuminations (1886) to modernist experimentation with form. In fact, Henri Peyre, an eminent scholar of French poetry, argues in Connaissance de Baudelaire (1951) that Le Spleen de Paris has had a greater influence on poetry than Les Fleurs du mal. This conclusion is surprising because it is only relatively recently that Baudelaire\u2019s prose poetry has attracted critical attention, but few critics have disagreed with Peyre. Le Spleen de Paris undoubtedly has had a significant influence on modern poetry.\nDuring the period in which he was seriously exploring prose poetry, Baudelaire experienced a series of financial disasters. He had sold his writings to Poulet-Malassis, who had gone bankrupt in 1862. La Presse stopped publishing his poetry in prose. He had signed over to Michel L\u00e9vy sole ownership for his translations of Poe for 2,000 francs, so he lost a regular income; furthermore, he could not get Lacroix and Verboeckhoven, another printing house based in Brussels, interested in his work. These circumstances led Baudelaire to travel to Brussels, where he hoped to earn money with a lecture series and to make contact with Victor Hugo\u2019s publisher, Lacroix et Verboeckhoven.\nBaudelaire arrived in Brussels on April 24, 1864 and checked into the Hotel du Grand Miroir, where he stayed, enduring a miserable sojourn, until his stroke in 1866. His lecture series was a failure: he got less money for the lectures than he was expecting, and though his first lecture got a good review, the rest were described by those who attended as disasters because of Baudelaire\u2019s stage fright. Baudelaire describes his last attempt to lecture in excruciating terms: there were three enormous drawing rooms, lit with chandeliers and candelabras, decorated with superb paintings, a \u201cprofusion\u201d of cake and wine\u2014and all for 10 or 12 people. He did not even bother to deliver the entire talk. In addition to the disappointment of the lecture series, Baudelaire did not make contact with Lacroix, who never accepted his invitations. Also, Baudelaire found the culture and climate of Belgium stifling, so stifling that while there he began writing a vitriolic indictment of the country titled \u201cPauvre Belgique!,\u201d which was pubblished in Oeuvres posthumes et correspondances in\u00e9dites (1887).\nDespite his unhappy situation, Baudelaire stayed on in Belgium, perhaps because he was hoping for a satirical book to come out of the stay, perhaps because he did not want to return to France without something to show for the trip, or perhaps because he could not pay his hotel bill. His time in Belgium was not in fact wasted: Poulet-Malassis had emigrated there to escape creditors in France, and with his help Baudelaire published Les \u00c9paves (The Wreckage, 1866), in which he assembled the condemned poems and other pieces left out of the French edition of Les Fleurs du mal. Baudelaire also became acquainted with Mme Hugo, even becoming a regular visitor at her home, and made contacts with local artists, notably with the engraver F\u00e9licien Rops.\nWhile visiting the Rops family, Baudelaire collapsed during a trip to the Eglise Saint-Loup on March 15, 1866. Baudelaire\u2019s health had been deteriorating for some time. There was no effective cure for syphilis in his day, and so although he thought he was cured of it in the early 1840s, his disease erupted in 1849, and again in the spring of 1861. In letters from January 1862 he describes recurrent and distressing symptoms. The doctors never mentioned syphilis in connection with his final illness, but it seems very likely that the cerebral hemorrhage of March 15 was caused by the debilitating effects of the disease.\nThe Rops took Baudelaire back to Brussels, and by March 31 paralysis had set in. He was transported to the Clinique Saint-Jean et Sainte Elisabeth on April 3. By April 4, Baudelaire was incapable of speaking coherently. Madame Aupick arrived in Brussels on April 14 and returned with Baudelaire to Paris at the end of June. Baudelaire was eventually moved into a hydrotherapeutic establishment, and it was there that he died on August 31, 1867.\nThe terrible irony of Baudelaire\u2019s story is that this supremely articulate man spent the last 17 months of his life reduced to incoherent monosyllables. This aphasic state was special torture for him because he seemed to understand what was going on around him but was unable to express himself. A particularly sad example of this situation touches on the publication of Baudelaire\u2019s complete works. He had wanted to find a publisher for them before his stroke, and his friends organized themselves to bring about what had become a last wish. Baudelaire conveyed with signs that he wanted L\u00e9vy as publisher, and this request was arranged. Ever the perfectionist, Baudelaire wanted to oversee the production of the manuscript. He knew, however, that he was in no condition to do so. In the hopes that he would eventually recover, Baudelaire used a calendar and a book published by L\u00e9vy to indicate that he wanted the process to wait until March 31. This date came with no improvement in Baudelaire\u2019s health, and his collected works had to be prepared without his supervision; the seven-volume Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes (Complete Works) were not published until after his death, between 1868 and 1873. Biographies were also quickly available: Asselineau\u2019s anecdotal Charles Baudelaire, sa vie et son oeuvre was published two years after the poet\u2019s death; the first scholarly biography of Baudelaire was written by Jacques Cr\u00e9pet in 1887 and completed by his son Eug\u00e8ne in 1907: Baudelaire. \u00c9tude biographique revue et compl\u00e9t\u00e9e par Jacques Cr\u00e9pet.\nBaudelaire had achieved an important reputation in the literary world by the time of his death; writers such as\u00a0St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9,\u00a0Paul Verlaine, and Rimbaud openly sang his praises. In his correspondence Rimbaud called him a \u201cg\u00e9nie, un voyant\u201d (genius, a visionary). In articles written for the journal L\u2019Art in November and December 1865 Verlaine credited Baudelaire with writing poetry about modern man. Mallarm\u00e9 celebrated Baudelaire in essays and took up many of his themes (Poe, escape from the physical world, and desire for the infinite). Baudelaire\u2019s influence has carried over into the 20th century and to other countries in the work of such writers as Pierre-Jean Jouve, Pierre Emmanuel, and T.S. Eliot.\nThough Baudelaire was accepted as a poet during his lifetime, his status with 19th-century critics was tenuous. Of 1500 books, 700 copies of Cr\u00e9pet\u2019s biographical study remained in 1892. Lurid articles that exaggerated Baudelaire\u2019s legendary eccentricities attended his death. Important scholars such as Ferdinand Bruneti\u00e8re and Gustave Lanson remained relatively ignorant of Baudelaire\u2019s achievements.\nToward the end of the 19th century small magazines began to perceive Baudelaire\u2019s work more clearly and to free him of the myth of decadence that had grown up around him. Baudelaire\u2019s importance was not fully recognized by the world of criticism until the 20th century, though. In 1926 Paul Val\u00e9ry\u2019s \u201cSituation de Baudelaire\u201d (The Situation of Baudelaire) was published as an introduction to Les Fleurs du mal; in 1927 Marcel Proust published the influential \u201cA propos de Baudelaire\u201d (On the Subject of Baudelaire). These essays and others brought about a renaissance for Baudelaire\u2019s fortunes in France, and by World War II his work was regularly anthologized and used in schools.\nBaudelaire\u2019s writings have also come to be greatly appreciated abroad, notably in England, where he was introduced by the critic Arthur Symons\u00a0and where the American poet Eliot subsequently introduced him to American and English modernist poetry. Baudelaire is now an important figure in the literary canon. Critical articles and books about him abound; the W.T. Bandy Center for Baudelaire Studies at Vanderbilt University is devoted to recording all major publications on the author and his work. In the 1980s and 1990s the prose poems seem to have become a particularly appealing topic for scholars of Baudelaire.\nBaudelaire\u2019s poetry has gone beyond what was once selective appreciation on the one hand and widespread notoriety on the other to general acclaim. Unlike Hugo, who cultivated his relationship with the public, Baudelaire in his career set himself apart by cultivating an eccentric image, by living an unconventional life, by writing poetry in verse that used Romantic topoi to upset them, and by launching a new form. While he did seek recognition, Baudelaire and his poetry are defined by their distinct individuality.\nIn Mon coeur mis \u00e0 nu, Baudelaire described a dynamic\u2014\u201cDe la vaporisation et de la centralisation du moi. Tout est l\u00e0.\u201d (The dispersion and the focusing of the self: those two movements are of the essence)\u2014that strongly characterizes his life as well as his work. Willing to outrage public opinion and yet desirous of popular acclaim, he spoke penetratingly on the human condition. From Baudelaire\u2019s personal, dark ruminations come epiphanies that illuminate even the 20th century. His poetry is read for those moments when, as Baudelaire wrote in his notebook, \u201cla profonder de la vie se r\u00e9v\u00e8le tout enti\u00e8re dans le spectacle, si ordinaire qu\u2019il soit, qu\u2019on a sous les yeux. Il en devient le symbole\u201d (the depth of life reveals itself in all its profundity in whatever one is looking at, however ordinary that spectacle might be. That vision becomes the symbol of life\u2019s depth).\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"]}}
