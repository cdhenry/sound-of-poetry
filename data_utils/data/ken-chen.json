His debut collection of poetry, Juvenilia (2010), won the Yale Series of Younger Poets Award. The book traces the development of a poet from child to adulthood and is marked by \u201cthe inability to communicate, an affliction that spans across generations for this Chinese American family,\u201d according to poet Rigoberto Gonz\u00e1lez. Judge Louise Gl\u00fcck noted that Chen\u2019s book is \u201cexhilaratingly modern \u2026 while at the same time never losing his attachment to voice, and the implicit claims of voice: these are poems of intense feeling.\u201d\n\r\nChen\u2019s poetry and nonfiction essays have appeared in journals such as Fence, Boston Review, Best American Essays, and elsewhere. He lives and works in New York City, where he directs the Asian American Writers\u2019 Workshop and founded CultureStrike, a national organization seeking to bring artists into the migrant justice movement.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
