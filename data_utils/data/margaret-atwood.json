Her books have received critical acclaim in the United States, Europe, and her native Canada, and she has received numerous literary awards, including the Booker Prize, the Arthur C. Clarke Award, and the Governor General\u2019s Award, twice. Atwood\u2019s critical popularity is matched by her popularity with readers; her books are regularly bestsellers and her novels have been adapted into popular movies and television series.\n\r\nAtwood was born in Ottawa and earned her BA from Victoria College at the University of Toronto and MA from Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She first came to public attention as a poet in the 1960s with her collections Double Persephone (1961), winner of the E.J. Pratt Medal, and The Circle Game (1964), winner of a Governor General\u2019s award. These two books marked out terrain her subsequent poetry has explored. Double Persephone dramatizes the contrasts between life and art, as well as natural and human creations. The Circle Game takes this opposition further, setting such human constructs as games, literature, and love against the instability of nature. Sherrill Grace, writing in Violent Duality: A Study of Margaret Atwood, identified the central tension in all of Atwood\u2019s work as \u201cthe pull towards art on one hand and towards life on the other.\u201d Atwood \u201cis constantly aware of opposites\u2014self/other, subject/object, male/female, nature/man\u2014and of the need to accept and work within them,\u201d Grace explained. Linda W. Wagner, writing in The Art of Margaret Atwood: Essays in Criticism, also saw the dualistic nature of Atwood\u2019s poetry, asserting that \u201cduality [is] presented as separation\u201d in her work. This separation leads her characters to be isolated from one another and from the natural world, resulting in their inability to communicate, to break free of exploitative social relationships, or to understand their place in the natural order. \u201cIn her early poetry,\u201d Gloria Onley wrote in the West Coast Review, Atwood \u201cis acutely aware of the problem of alienation, the need for real human communication and the establishment of genuine human community\u2014real as opposed to mechanical or manipulative; genuine as opposed to the counterfeit community of the body politic.\u201d\n\r\nSuffering is common for the female characters in Atwood\u2019s poems, although they are never passive victims. Atwood\u2019s poems, West Coast Review contributor Onley maintained, concern \u201cmodern woman\u2019s anguish at finding herself isolated and exploited (although also exploiting) by the imposition of a sex role power structure.\u201d Atwood explained to Judy Klemesrud in the New York Times that her suffering characters come from real life: \u201cMy women suffer because most of the women I talk to seem to have suffered.\u201d Although she became a favorite of feminists, Atwood\u2019s popularity in the feminist community was unsought. \u201cI began as a profoundly apolitical writer,\u201d she told Lindsy Van Gelder of Ms., \u201cbut then I began to do what all novelists and some poets do: I began to describe the world around me.\u201d\n\r\nAtwood\u2019s 1995 book of poetry, Morning in the Burned House, \u201creflects a period in Atwood\u2019s life when time seems to be running out,\u201d observed John Bemrose in Maclean\u2019s. Noting that many of the poems address grief and loss, particularly in relationship to her father\u2019s death and a realization of her own mortality, Bemrose added that the book \u201cmoves even more deeply into survival territory.\u201d Bemrose further suggested that in this book, Atwood allows the readers greater latitude in interpretation than in her earlier verse: \u201cAtwood uses grief \u2026 to break away from that airless poetry and into a new freedom.\u201d A selection of Atwood\u2019s poems was released as Eating Fire: Selected Poems 1965-1995 in 1998. Showing the arc of Atwood\u2019s poetics, the volume was praised by Scotland on Sunday for its \u201clean, symbolic, thoroughly Atwoodesque prose honed into elegant columns.\u201d Atwood\u2019s 2007 collection, The Door, was her first new volume of poems in a decade. Reviewing the book for the Guardian, the noted literary critic Jay Parini maintained that Atwood\u2019s \u201cnorthern\u201d poetic climate is fully on view, \u201cfull of wintry scenes, harsh autumnal rain, splintered lives, and awkward relationships. Against this landscape, she draws figures of herself.\u201d Parini found Atwood using irony, the conventions of confessional verse, political attitudes and gestures, as well as moments of ars poetica throughout the collection. \u201cThere is a pleasing consistency in these poems,\u201d he wrote \u201cwhich are always written in a fluent free verse, in robust, clear language. Atwood\u2019s wit and humour are pervasive, and few of the poems end without an ironic twang.\u201d\n\r\nAtwood\u2019s interest in female experience also emerges clearly in her novels, particularly in The Edible Woman (1969), Surfacing (1972), Life before Man (1979), Bodily Harm (1981), and The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (1985). Even later novels such as The Robber Bride (1993) and Alias Grace (1996) feature female characters defined by their intelligence and complexity. By far Atwood\u2019s most famous early novel, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale also presages her later trilogy of scientific dystopia and environmental disaster Oryx and Crake (2003), The Year of the Flood (2009), and MaddAddam (2013). Rather than \u201cscience fiction,\u201d Atwood uses the term \u201cspeculative fiction\u201d to describe her project in these novels. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is dominated by an unforgiving view of patriarchy and its legacies. As Barbara Holliday wrote in the Detroit Free Press, Atwood \u201chas been concerned in her fiction with the painful psychic warfare between men and women. In The Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u2026 she casts subtlety aside, exposing woman\u2019s primal fear of being used and helpless.\u201d Atwood, however, believes that her vision is not far from reality. Speaking to Battiata, Atwood noted that \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale does not depend upon hypothetical scenarios, omens, or straws in the wind, but upon documented occurrences and public pronouncements; all matters of record.\u201d\nAtwood\u2019s next few books deal less with speculative worlds and more with history, literary convention, and narrative hi-jinx. In The Robber Bride, Atwood again explores women\u2019s issues and feminist concerns, this time concentrating on women\u2019s relationships with each other\u2014both positive and negative. Inspired by the Brothers Grimm\u2019s fairy tale \u201cThe Robber Bridegroom,\u201d the novel chronicles the relationships of college friends Tony, Charis, and Roz with their backstabbing classmate Zenia. Lorrie Moore, writing in the New York Times Book Review, called The Robber Bride \u201cAtwood\u2019s funniest and most companionable book in years,\u201d adding that its author \u201cretains her gift for observing, in poetry, the minutiae specific to the physical and emotional lives of her characters.\u201d Alias Grace represents Atwood\u2019s first venture into historical fiction, but the book has much in common with her other works in its contemplation of \u201cthe shifting notions of women\u2019s moral nature\u201d and \u201cthe exercise of power between men and women,\u201d wrote Maclean\u2019s contributor Diane Turbide. Several reviewers found Grace, a woman accused of murdering her employer and his wife but who claims amnesia, a complicated and compelling character. Turbide added that Grace is more than an intriguing character: she is also \u201cthe lens through which Victorian hypocrisies are mercilessly exposed.\u201d\nAtwood continues to investigate the conventions and expectations of genre literature in The Blind Assassin (2000), which won the prestigious Booker Prize. The novel involves multiple story lines; interspersed with these narrative threads are sections devoted to one character\u2019s novel, The Blind Assassin, published posthumously. Michiko Kakutani in the New York Times called The Blind Assassin an \u201cabsorbing new novel\u201d that \u201cshowcases Ms. Atwood\u2019s narrative powers and her ardent love of the Gothic.\u201d Atwood\u2019s next novels, however, return to the speculative terrain she mapped out in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Oryx and Crake, The Year of the Flood, and MaddAddam form a trilogy about a world of fundamental environmental catastrophe. Reviewing Oryx and Crake, Kakutani in the New York Times wrote, \u201conce again she conjures up a dystopia, where trends that started way back in the twentieth century have metastasized into deeply sinister phenomena.\u201d Science contributor Susan M. Squier wrote that \u201cAtwood imagines a drastic revision of the human species that will purge humankind of all of our negative traits.\u201d Squier went on to note that \u201cin Oryx and Crake readers will find a powerful meditation on how education that separates scientific and aesthetic ways of knowing produces ignorance and a wounded world.\u201d Atwood\u2019s most recent novels include The Heart Goes Last (2015), which she began in serial installments online, Hag-Seed (2016), a retelling of Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest, and the graphic novel Angel Catbird (2016).\nAtwood is known for her strong support of causes: feminism, environmentalism, social justice. In Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature (1972), Atwood discerns a uniquely Canadian literature, distinct from its American and British counterparts. Canadian literature, she argues, is primarily concerned with victims and with the victim\u2019s ability to survive unforgiving circumstances. In the way other countries or cultures focus around a unifying symbol\u2014America\u2019s frontier, England\u2019s island\u2014Canada and Canadian literature orientate around survival. Several critics find that Atwood\u2019s own work exemplifies this primary theme of Canadian literature. Her examination of destructive gender roles and her nationalistic concern over the subordinate role Canada plays to the United States are variations on the victor/victim theme. Atwood believes a writer must consciously work within his or her nation\u2019s literary tradition, and her own work closely parallels the themes she sees as common to the Canadian literary tradition.\nAtwood has also continued to write about writing. Her lectures Negotiating with the Dead: A Writer on Writing were published under the same title in 2002. She has also released several essay collections, including Moving Targets: Writing with Intent, 1982-2004 (2004) and Curious Pursuits: Occasional Writing, 1970-2005 (2005). In 2008 she published the collection Payback: Debt and the Shadow Side of Wealth. Examining the peculiar financial straits of the 21st century, Atwood also traces the historical precedents for lending, borrowing, and debt. Her collection In Other Worlds: SF and the Human Imagination (2011) explores the resources of science fiction as speculative thought. According to Nick Owchar in the Los Angeles Times, \u201cAtwood explains how the genre fits into a continuum dating to the world\u2019s oldest myths and continuing today with authors who use the genre to examine social ills, not run away from them.\u201d\nAlthough she has been labeled a Canadian nationalist, a feminist, a gothic and science fiction writer, given the range and volume of her work, Atwood both incorporates and transcends all of these categories.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Canada"]}}
