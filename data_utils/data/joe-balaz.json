He writes in both American English and Pidgin (Hawaiian Creole English) and often composes concrete poetry with elements of visual art. His album of pidgin poetry, Electric Laulau (1998), is considered a foundational text in Kanaka Maoli (native Hawaiian) literature. Of the importance of oral traditions to his work, Balaz has said, \u201cSpoken word and amplified poetry or music poetry are dynamic avenues that enhance the communal aspect of literature in general. It\u2019s like a chant that reaches out to you. With the oral traditions of Pacific Island cultures, one can feel a kind of continuum with these modern art forms that harken back to an older vibe.\u201d\nBalaz\u2019s work appears in Whetu Moana: Contemporary Polynesian Poems in English (2003) and journals such as Bamboo Ridge. He edited Ho\u2018oma\u00afnoa: An Anthology of Contemporary Hawaiian Literature (1989) and is the former editor of O\u2018ahu Review. Balaz currently lives in Ohio.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Pacific Islands"]}}
