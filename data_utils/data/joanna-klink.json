Her collections of poetry include They Are Sleeping (2000), Circadian (2007), Raptus (2010) and Excerpts from a Secret Prophecy (2015). Her work has been included in numerous anthologies, most recently Resistance, Rebellion, Life: 50 Poems Now (2017) and The Penguin Anthology of 20th Century American Poetry (2011). Of her work, Klink has said:\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIn poems I am trying to find my bearings through a world that at times feels remote and inchoate and struck blank with noise. I would like to place myself in a field of deep attention, and out of that attention come to feel and regard with more acute understanding what is there. I write to be less hopelessly myself, to sense something more expansive than where I speak from.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKlink has received awards and fellowships from The Rona Jaffe Foundation, Jeannette Haien Ballard, Civitella Ranieri, The Bogliasco Foundation, The American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Trust of Amy Lowell, and the Guggenheim Foundation. She was the Briggs-Copeland Poet at Harvard University and teaches in the Creative Writing Program at The University of Montana.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
