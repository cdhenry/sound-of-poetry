He is the author of a full-length collection Spleen Elegy (2017) and a handful of chapbooks, including\u00a0Blackwash Canal (2011) and\u00a0Dear Photographer\u00a0(2009). His poems and prose appear widely in such publications as\u00a0Poetry magazine,\u00a0Boston Review,\u00a0A Public Space,\u00a0Conjunctions,\u00a0Colorado Review, and DIAGRAM.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRanging from dense abstractionist meditations to austere minimalist lyrics, Labbe's work explores themes of trauma, recovery, and the intersection (or collision) of the analog realm with digital technology, as reflected in the postmodern American landscape.\u00a0Dan Beachy-Quick says of Spleen Elegy, \u201cJason Labbe well knows, as Whitman\u2019s atoms become pixels, we find ourselves at a crossroads, learning again and again the consequences of \u2018the indescribable way you shape / a past of little use.\u2019\u201d\n\u00a0\nLabbe has taught writing at the University of Virginia, the University of Connecticut, and Southern Connecticut State University. Also a drummer and recording engineer, he has worked with many artists in New England and New York City. He splits his time between Bethany, Connecticut and Brooklyn, New York.\n", "attrs": {}}
