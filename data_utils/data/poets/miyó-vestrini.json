As a teenager, she joined the avant-garde group Apocalipsis (Apocalypse); she eventually became affiliated with a number of other groups, including 40 Grados Bajo la Sombra (40 degrees in the Shade), El Techo de La Ballena (The Ceiling of the Whale) and La Republica del este (The Republic of the East). One of the few women in the male-dominated Venezuelan avant-garde of the 1960s, \u201870s, and \u201880s, she was also a respected journalist and editor of the arts section of El Nacional. She published three books of poetry during these years: Las historias de Giovana (1971), El invierno pr\u00f3ximo (1975), and Pocas virtudes (1986). Vestrini committed suicide in 1991, leaving behind a book of poems, Valiente Ciudadano, and a book of stories, \u00d3rdenes al coraz\u00f3n. \nSometimes called the poet of \u201cmilitant death\u201d or the Venezuelan Sylvia Plath, Vestrini\u2019s work braids political and confessional registers to address what the publishers of Vestrini\u2019s first book in English, Grenade in Mouth, call \u201ca fatal disappointment with the world at large.\u201d Reviewing the translation for Hyperallergic, M. Buda noted, \u201cfor Vestrini, the refusal to compromise or accept tyrannical notions of truth was as much a part of her process as her meditations on death. In her writings, death and poetry have their own dark choreography that doesn\u2019t shy away from affirming the stark contradictions at its core\u2014exercises in morbidity also result in the resurrection of a new will to live, in a counter-suicidal impulse, even if it\u2019s only a temporary one.\u201d Grenade in Mouth: Some Poems of Miy\u00f3 Vestrini (2019) spans the decades of Vestrini\u2019s career and includes previously unpublished work. Poems were selected by Faride Mereb and Elisa Maggi and translated by Anne Boyer and Cassandra Gillig.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
