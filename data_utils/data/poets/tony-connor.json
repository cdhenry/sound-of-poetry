He earned an MA at the University of Manchester. With poet Robin Skelton and painter Michael Snow, Connor founded the Peterloo Group of Manchester writers and artists.\u00a0Connor\u2019s working-class domestic and social narratives explore themes of exile and personal history. In a review of Connor\u2019s earlier New and Selected Poems (1982) for the Hudson Review, poet Dana Gioia observed, \u201cConnor does not simply report events. He vividly recreates them, shaping each scene with the skill and care of a novelist \u2026 his work remains clear-headed, intelligent and immensely readable.\u201d Connor is the author of numerous collections, including With Love Somehow (1962), In the Happy Valley (1971), and Things Unsaid: New and Selected Poems 1960\u20132005 (2006). His tenth book of poems is\u00a0The Empty Air\u00a0(2012).\u00a0In 1974, Connor was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. A professor emeritus of English at Wesleyan University, Connor also taught at Amherst College and Bolton Technical College, in Manchester. He lives in London and Middletown, Connecticut. The McPherson Library at the University of Victoria holds a selection of his papers.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
