Like his father, Burns was a tenant farmer. However, toward the end of his life he became an excise collector in Dumfries, where he died in 1796; throughout his life he was also a practicing poet. His poetry recorded and celebrated aspects of farm life, regional experience, traditional culture, class culture and distinctions, and religious practice. He is considered the national poet of Scotland. Although he did not set out to achieve that designation, he clearly and repeatedly expressed his wish to be called a Scots bard, to extol his native land in poetry and song, as he does in \u201cThe Answer\u201d:\nEv\u2019n thena wish (I mind its power)\r\nA wish, that to my latest hour\r\nShall strongly heave my breast;\r\nThat I for poor auld Scotland\u2019s sake\r\nSome useful plan, or book could make,\r\nOr sing a sang at least.\nAnd perhaps he had an intimation that his \u201cwish\u201d had some basis in reality when he described his Edinburgh reception in a letter of December 7, 1786 to his friend Gavin Hamilton: \u201cI am in a fair way of becoming as eminent as Thomas a Kempis or John Bunyan; and you may expect henceforth to see my birthday inserted among the wonderful events, in the Poor Robin\u2019s and Aberdeen Almanacks. \u2026 and by all probability I shall soon be the tenth Worthy, and the eighth Wise Man, of the world.\u201d\n\r\nThat he is considered Scotland\u2019s national poet today owes much to his position as the culmination of the Scottish literary tradition, a tradition stretching back to the court makars, to Robert Henryson and William Dunbar, to the 17th-century vernacular writers from James VI of Scotland to William Hamilton of Gilbertfield, to early 18th-century forerunners such as Allan Ramsay and Robert Fergusson. Burns is often seen as the end of that literary line both because his brilliance and achievement could not be equaled and, more particularly, because the Scots vernacular in which he wrote some of his celebrated works was\u2014even as he used it\u2014becoming less and less intelligible to the majority of readers, who were already well-versed with English culture and language. The shift toward English cultural and linguistic hegemony had begun in 1603 with the Union of the Crowns when James VI of Scotland became James I of Great Britain; it had continued in 1707 with the merging of the Scottish and English Parliaments in London; and it was virtually a fait accompli by Burns\u2019s day save for pockets of regional culture and dialect. Thus, one might say that Burns remains the national poet of Scotland because Scottish literature ceased with him, thereafter yielding poetry in English or in Anglo-Scots or in imitations of Burns.\n\r\nBurns, however, has been viewed alternately as the beginning of another literary tradition: he is often called a pre-Romantic poet for his sensitivity to nature, his high valuation of feeling and emotion, his spontaneity, his fierce stance for freedom and against authority, his individualism, and his antiquarian interest in old songs and legends. The many backward glances of Romantic poets to Burns, as well as their critical comments and pilgrimages to the locales of Burns\u2019s life and work, suggest the validity of connecting Burns with that pervasive European cultural movement of the late 18h and early 19th centuries which shared with him a concern for creating a better world and for cultural renovation.\n\r\nNonetheless, the very qualities which seem to link Burns to the Romantics were logical responses to the 18th-century Scotland into which he was born. And his humble, agricultural background made him in some ways a spokesperson for every Scot, especially the poor and disenfranchised. He was aware of humanity\u2019s unequal condition and wrote of it and of his hope for a better world of equality throughout his life in epistle, poem, and song\u2014perhaps most eloquently in the recurring comparison of rich and poor in the song \u201cFor A\u2019 That and A\u2019 That,\u201d which resoundingly affirms the humanity of the honest, hard-working, poor, man: \u201cThe Honest man, though e\u2019er sae poor, / Is king o\u2019 men for a\u2019 that.\u201d\n\r\nBurns is an important and complex literary personage for several reasons: his place in the Scottish literary tradition, his pre-Romantic proclivities, his position as a human being from the less-privileged classes imaging a better world. To these may be added his particular artistry, especially his ability to create encapsulating and synthesizing lines, phrases, and stanzas which continue to speak to and sum up the human condition. His recurring and poignant hymns to relationships are illustrative, as in the lines from the song beginning \u201cAe fond Kiss\u201d:\n\r\nHad we never lov\u2019d sae kindly,\r\nHad we never lov\u2019d sae blindly!\r\nNever met\u2014or never parted,\r\nWe had ne\u2019er been broken-hearted.\n\r\nThe Scotland in which Burns lived was a country in transition, sometimes in contradiction, on several fronts. The political scene was in flux, the result of the 1603 and 1707 unions which had stripped Scotland of its autonomy and finally all but muzzled the Scottish voice, as decisions and directives issued from London rather than from Edinburgh. A sense of loss led to questions and sometimes to actions, as in the Jacobite rebellions early in the 18th century. Was there a national identity? Should aspects of Scottish uniqueness be collected and enshrined? Should Scotland move ahead, adopting English manners, language, and cultural forms? No single answer was given to any of these questions. But change was afoot: Scots moved closer to an English norm, particularly as it was used by those in the professions, religion, and elite circles; \u201cthink in English, feel in Scots\u201d seems to have been a widespread practice, which limited the communicative role, as well as the intelligibility, of Scots. For a time, however, remnants of the Scots dialect met with approbation among certain circles. A loose-knit movement to preserve evidences of Scottish culture embraced products that had the stamp of Scotland upon them, lauding Burns as a poet from the soil; assembling, editing, and collecting Scottish ballads and songs; sometimes accepting James Macpherson\u2019s Ossianic offerings; and lauding poetic Jacobitism. This movement was both nationalistic and antiquarian, recognizing Scottish identity through the past and thereby implicitly accepting contemporary assimilation.\n\r\nPerhaps the most extraordinary transition occurring between 1780 and 1830 was the economic shift from agriculture to industry that radically altered social arrangements and increased social inequities. While industrialization finished the job agricultural changes had set the transition in motion earlier in the 18th century. Agriculture in Scotland had typically followed a widespread European form known as runrig, wherein groups of farmers rented and worked a piece of land which was periodically re-sub-divided to insure diachronic if not synchronic equity. Livestock was removed to the hills for grazing during the growing season since there were no enclosures. A subsistence arrangement, this form of agriculture dictated settlement patterns and life possibilities and was linked inextricably to the ebb and flow and unpredictable vicissitudes of the seasons. The agricultural revolution of the 18th century introduced new crops, such as sown grasses and turnips, which made wintering over of animals profitable; advocated enclosing fields to keep livestock out; developed new equipment\u2014in particular the iron plow\u2014and improved soil preparation; and generally suggested economies of scale. Large landowners, seeing profit in making \u201cimprovements,\u201d displaced runrig practices and their adherents, broadening the social and economic gap between landowner and former tenant; the latter frequently became a farm worker. Haves and have-nots became more clearly delineated; \u201cimprovements\u201d depended on capital and access to descriptive literature. Many small tenant farmers foundered during the transition, including both Burnes and his father.\n\r\nAlong with the gradual change in agriculture and shift to industry there was a concomitant shift from rural to urban spheres of influence. The move from Scots to greater reliance on English was accelerated by the availability of cheap print made possible by the Industrial Revolution. Print became the medium of choice, lessening the power of oral culture\u2019s artistic forms and aesthetic structures; print, a visual medium, fostered linear structures and perceptual frameworks, replacing in part the circular patterns and preferences of the oral world.\n\r\nTwo forces, however, served to keep change from being a genuine revolution and made it more nearly a transformation by fits and starts: the Presbyterian church and traditional culture. Presbyterianism was established as the Kirk of Scotland in 1668. Although fostering education, the printed word, and, implicitly, English for specific religious ends, and thus seeming to support change, religion was largely a force for constraint and uniformity. Religion was aided but simultaneously undermined by traditional culture, the inherited ways of living, perceiving, and creating. Traditional culture was conservative, preferring the old ways\u2014agricultural subsistence or near subsistence patterns and oral forms of information and artistry conveyed in customs, songs, and stories. But if both religion and traditional culture worked to maintain the status quo, traditional culture was finally more flexible: as inherited, largely oral knowledge and art always adapting to fit the times, traditional culture was less rigid. It was diverse and it celebrated freedom.\n\r\nScotland\u2019s upheavals were in many ways Burns\u2019s upheavals as well: he embraced cultural nationalism to celebrate Scotland in poem and song; he struggled as a tenant farmer without the requisite capital and know-how in the age of \u201cimprovement\u201d; he combined the oral world of his childhood and region with the education his father arranged through an \u201cadventure school\u201d; he accepted, but resented, the moral judgments of the Kirk against himself and friends such as Gavin Hamilton; he knew the religious controversies which pitted moderate against conservative on matters of church control and belief; he reveled in traditional culture\u2019s balladry, song, proverbs, and customs. He was a man of his time, and his success as poet, songwriter, and human being owes much to the way he responded to the world around him. Some have called him the typical Scot, Everyman.\n\r\nBurns began his career as a local poet writing for a local, known audience to whom he looked for immediate response, as do all artists in a traditional context. He wrote on topics of appeal both to himself and to his artistic constituency, often in a wonderfully appealing conversational style.\n\r\nBurns\u2019s early life was spent in the southwest of Scotland, where his father worked as an estate gardener in Alloway, near Ayr. Subsequently William Burnes leased successively two farms in the region, Mount Oliphant nearby and Lochlie near Tarbolton. Between 1765 and 1768 Burns attended an \u201cadventure\u201d school established by his father and several neighbors with John Murdock as teacher, and in 1775 he attended a mathematics school in Kirkoswald. These formal and more or less institutionalized bouts of education were extended at home under the tutelage of his father. Burns was identified as odd because he always carried a book; a countrywoman in Dunscore, who had seen Burns riding slowly among the hills reading, once remarked, \u201cThat\u2019s surely no a good man, for he has aye a book in his hand!\u201d The woman no doubt assumed an oral norm, the medium of traditional culture.\n\r\nLife on a pre-or semi-improved farm was backbreaking and frequently heartbreaking, since bad weather might wipe out a year\u2019s effort. Bad seed would not prosper even in the best-prepared soil. Rain and damp, though necessary for crop growth, were often \u201ctoo much of a good thing.\u201d Burns grew up knowing the vagaries of farming and understanding full well both mental preparation and long days of physical labor. His father had married late and was thus older than many men with a household of children; he was also less physically resilient and less able to endure the tenant farmer\u2019s lot. Bad seed and rising rents at various times spelled failure to his ventures. At the time of his approaching death and a disastrous end to the Lochlie lease, Burns and his brother secretly leased Mossgiel Farm near Mauchline. Burns was 25.\n\r\nThe death of his father, the family\u2019s patriarchal force for constraint in religion, education, and morality, freed Burns. He quickly became recognized as a rhymer, sometimes signing himself after the farm as Rab Mossgiel. The midwife\u2019s prophecy at his birth\u2014that he would be much attracted to the lasses\u2014became a reality; in 1785 he fathered a daughter by Betty Paton, and in 1786 had twins by Jean Armour. His fornications and his thoughts about the Kirk, made public, opened him to church censure, which he bore but little accepted. It was almost as though the floodgates had burst: his poetic output between 1784 and 1786 includes many of those works on which his reputation stands\u2014epistles, satires, manners-painting, and songs\u2014many of which he circulated in the manner of the times: in manuscript or by reading aloud. Many works of this period, judiciously chosen to appeal to a wider audience, appeared in the first formal publication of his work, Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect, printed in Kilmarnock in 1786 and paid for by subscriptions.\n\r\nThe Kilmarnock edition might be seen as the result of two years or so of riotous living: much conviviality, much socializing with women in an era before birth control, much thinking about humanity without the \u201ccorrecting\u201d restraint of the paterfamilias, much poetry and song ostensibly about the immediate environment but encapsulating aspects of the human condition. All of this was certainly more interesting than the agricultural round, which offered a physical constraint to match the moral and mental constraint of religion. Both forms of constraint impeded the delight in life that many of Burns\u2019s finest works exhibit. Furthermore, he was in serious trouble with the Armour family, who destroyed a written and acceptable, if a bit unorthodox, marriage contract. He resolved to get out of town quickly and to leave behind something to prove his worth. He seems to have made plans to immigrate to the West Indies, and he brought to fruition his plan to publish some of his already well-received works. One of the 612 copies reached Edinburgh and was perceived to have merit. Informed of this casual endorsement, Burns abandoned his plans for immigration\u2014if they had ever been serious\u2014and left instead for Edinburgh.\n\r\nThe Kilmarnock edition shows Burns\u2019s penchant for self-presentation and his ability to choose variable poses to fit the expectations of the intended receiver. Burns presents himself as an untutored rhymer, who wrote to counteract life\u2019s woes; he feigns anxiety over the reception of his poems; he pays tribute to the genius of the Scots poets Ramsay and Fergusson; and he requests the reader\u2019s indulgence. In large measure, the material belies the tentativeness of the preface, revealing a poet aware of his literary tradition, capable of building on it, and deft in using a variety of voices\u2014from \u201ccouthie\u201d and colloquial, through sentimental and tender, to satiric and pointed. But the book also contains evidence of Burns as local poet, turning life to verse in slight, spur-of-the-moment pieces, occasional rhymes made on local personages, often to the gratification of their enemies. The Kilmarnock edition, however, is more revealing for its illustration of his place in a literary tradition: \u201cThe Cotter\u2019s Saturday Night,\u201d for example, echoes Fergusson\u2019s \u201cThe Farmer\u2019s Ingle\u201d (1773); \u201cThe Holy Fair\u201d is part of a long tradition of peasant brawls, drawing on a verse form, the Chrystis Kirk stanza, known by the name of a representative poem attributed to James I: \u201cChrystis Kirk of the Grene.\u201d Many of Burns\u2019s poems and verse epistles employ the six-line stanza, derived from the medieval tail-rhyme stanza which was used in Scotland by Sir David Lindsay in Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis (1602) but was probably seen by Burns in James Watson\u2019s Choice Collection (1706-1711) in works by Hamilton of Gilbertfield and Robert Sempill of Beltrees; Sempill\u2019s \u201cThe Life and Death of Habbie Simpson\u201d gave the form its accepted name, Standard Habbie. Quotations from and allusions to English literary figures and their works appear throughout his work: Thomas Gray in \u201cThe Cotter\u2019s Saturday Night,\u201d Alexander Pope in \u201cHoly Willie\u2019s Prayer,\u201d John Milton in \u201cAddress to the Deil.\u201d\n\nPoems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (an undistinguished title used often before and after as a title of local poets\u2019 effusions) was a success. With all its obvious contradictions\u2014untutored but clearly lettered; peasant but perspicacious; conscious national pride (\u201cThe Vision,\u201d \u201cScotch Drink\u201d) together with multiple references to other literatures\u2014the Kilmarnock edition set the stage for Burns\u2019s success in Edinburgh and anticipated his conscious involvement in the cultural nationalistic movement. Such works as \u201cAddress to the Deil\u201d anticipate this later concern:\nO Thou, whatever title suit theee!\r\nAuld Hornie, Satan, Nick, or Clootie,\r\nWha in you cavern grim an\u2019 sooty\r\nClos\u2019d under hatches,\r\nSpairges about the brunstane cootie,\r\nTo scaud poor wretches!\n\r\nHear me, auld Hangie, for a wee,\r\nAn\u2019 let poor, damned bodies bee;\r\nI\u2019m sure sma\u2019 pleasure it can gie,\r\nEv\u2019n to a deil,\r\nTo skelp an\u2019 scaud poor dogs like me,\r\nAn\u2019 hear us squeel!\nThese two stanzas provide evidence of the implicit tension between established religion and traditional culture rampant in Burns\u2019s early work. Burns takes his epigraph from Milton\u2014\nO Prince, O chief of many throned pow\u2019rs,\nThat led th\u2019 embattl\u2019d Seraphim to war\u2014\n\r\nconjuring up biblical ideas of Satan as fallen angel, hell as a place of fire and damnation, the devil as punisher of evil. But Burns\u2019s deil, familiarly addressed, is an almost comic, ever-present figure, tempting humanity but escapable. Burns allies him with traditional forces\u2014spunkies, waterkelpies\u2014and gives old Clootie no more force or power. Traditional notions of the devil are much less restraining than the formal religious concepts. By juxtaposing Satan and Auld Nickie, Burns conjures up metaphorically the two dominant cultural forces\u2014one for constraint and the other for freedom. Here as elsewhere in Burns\u2019s work, freedom reigns.\n\r\nBurns\u2019s affection for traditional culture is amply illustrated. In a well-known autobiographical letter to Dr. John Moore (August 2, 1787) he pays tribute to its early influence when he says, \u201cIn my infant and boyish days too, I owed much to an old Maid of my Mother\u2019s, remarkable for her ignorance, credulity and superstition.\u2014She had, I suppose, the largest collection in the county of tales and songs concerning devils, ghosts, fairies, brownies, witches, warlocks, spunkies, kelpies, elf-candles, dead-lights, wraiths, apparitions, cantraips, giants, inchanted towers, dragons and other trumpery.\u2014This cultivated the latent seeds of Poesy.\u201d\n\r\nBurns\u2019s first and last works were songs, reflecting his deep connection with oral ballad and song. The world of custom and belief is most particularly described in \u201cHalloween,\u201d an ethnographic poem with footnotes elucidating rural customs. Many forms of prognostication are possible on this evening when this world and the other world or worlds hold converse, a time when unusual things are deemed possible\u2014especially foretelling one\u2019s future mate and status. Burns\u2019s notes and prefatory material have often been used as evidence of his distance from and perhaps disdain for such practices. Yet the poem itself is peopled with a sympathetic cast of youths, chaperoned by an old woman, joined together for fun and fellowship. The youthful players try several prognosticatory rites in attempting to anticipate their future love relationships. In one stanza Burns alludes to a particular practice\u2014\u201cpou their stalks o\u2019 corn\u201d\u2014and explains in his note that \u201cthey go to the barn-yard, and pull each, at three several times, a stalk of Oats. If the third stalk wants the top-pickle, that is, the grain at the top of the stalk, the party in question will come to the marriage-bed any thing but a Maid.\u201d Burns concludes the stanza by saying that one Nelly almost lost her top-pickle that very night. Some of the activities in what is essentially a preliminary courtship ritual are frightening, requiring collective daring. Burns describes the antics, anticipation, and anxieties of the participants as they enjoy the communal event, which is concluded with food and drink:\nWi\u2019 merry sangs, an\u2019 friendly cracks,\r\nI wat they did na weary;\r\nAnd unco tales, an\u2019 funnie jokes,\r\nTheir sports were cheap an\u2019 cheary:\r\nTill buttr\u2019d So\u2019ns, wi\u2019 fragrant lunt,\r\nSet a\u2019 their gabs a steerin;\r\nSyne, wi\u2019 a social glass o\u2019 strunt,\r\nThey parted aff careerin\r\nFu\u2019 blythe that night.\n\u201cThe Cotter\u2019s Saturday Night\u201d is on one level a microcosmic description of the agricultural, social, and religious practices of the farm worker\u2014albeit an idealized vision that reiterates Burns\u2019s absolute affection for traditional aspects of life, a fictive version of his own experience. The poem is a celebration of the family and of the lives of simple folk, sanitized of hardship, crop failure, sickness, and death. Burns achieves this vision by focusing on a moment of domestic repose of a family reunited in love and affection. The Master and Mistress are the architects of the family circle; Jenny and \u201ca neebor lad\u201d seem destined to provide continuity. The gathering concludes with family worship: songs are sung and Scripture is read, including biblical accounts of human failings by way of warning. The domestic celebration of religion within the context of traditional life is noble and good.\nFrom Scenes like these, old SCOTIA\u2019S grandeur springs,\r\nThat makes her lov\u2019d at home, rever\u2019d abroad:\r\nPrinces and lords are but the breath of kings,\r\n\u2018An honest man\u2019s the noble work of GOD.\u2019\nThis poem was lauded largely because of its linguistic accessibility, as a pastoral expression of nationalism, a symbolic representation of the \u201csoul of Scotland.\u201d Auguste Angellier offers critical affirmation: \u201cNever has the existence of the poor been invested with so much dignity.\u201d The lowly farm worker is depicted as the ideal Scot. The cotter\u2019s good life was already an anachronism, so Burns\u2019s depiction in this early poem is antiquarian, backward-looking, and imbued with cultural nationalism\u2014perspectives which became intensified and focused in his later work. But by 1784-1785 his work was already engaged in dialogue with larger cultural issues. The linguistic attributes of the poem become part of this conversation as Burns modulates from Scots into Scots English to English, poetically reflecting the dichotomy of feeling and thinking. The stability of life as described in this poem is a wonderful accommodation of traditional culture and religion; celebration of belief in God follows naturally from sharing a way of life. But the religion that is here applauded is domestic and familial. Institutional religion Burns saw as something quite other.\n\r\nInstitutional religion at its worst is excessively hierarchical, constraining, and above all unjust, damning some and saving others. As a child Burns was steeped in the doctrine of predestination and effectual calling, which asserts that some people are \u201celected\u201d by God to be saved without any consideration of life and works; the unchosen are damned no matter what they do. Carried to an extreme, the doctrine would permit an individual who felt assured of election to do all manner of evil, a scenario developed in Burns\u2019s \u201cHoly Willie\u2019s Prayer.\u201d Burns could not accept the orthodox position of the so-called Auld Lichts; he believed in the power of good works to determine salvation. His corner of Scotland was a bastion of conservative religious position and practice: the Kirk session served as a moral watchdog, summoning congregants who strayed from the \u201cstraight and narrow\u201d and handing out censure and punishment.\n\r\nThus religion was a cultural force with which to contend. Burns participated in the debate through poetry, circulating his material orally and in manuscript. Chief among his works in this vein is the satire \u201cHoly Willie\u2019s Prayer.\u201d Prompted by the defeat of the Auld Licht censure of his friend Hamilton for failure to participate in public worship, the poem, shaped like a prayer, is put into the mouth of the Auld Licht adherent Holy Willie. It begins with an effective invocation which articulates Willie\u2019s doctrinal stance on predestination in Standard Habbie:\nO Thou that in the heavens does dwell!\r\nWha, as it pleases best thysel,\r\nSends ane to heaven an ten to h-ll,\r\nA\u2019 for thy glory!\r\nAnd no for ony gude or ill\r\nThey\u2019ve done before thee.\nThe poem continues with Willie\u2019s thanks for his own \u201celected\u201d status and reaches its highest moments in Willie\u2019s confession that \u201cAt times I\u2019m fash\u2019d wi\u2019 fleshly lust.\u201d Burns has Willie condemn himself by describing moments of fornication and justifying them as temptations visited on him by God. The concluding stanzas recount Willie\u2019s opinion of Hamilton\u2014\u201cHe drinks, and swears, and plays at cartes\u201d\u2014and his chagrin that Minister Auld was defeated. The poem ends with the requisite petition, calling for divine vengeance on those who disagree with him and asking blessings for himself and his like. Burns condemns both the doctrine and the practice of institutional religion.\n\r\nThe tensions between religion and traditional culture are particularly obvious in \u201cThe Holy Fair.\u201d Burns\u2019s depiction of an open-air communion gathering, with multiple sermons and exhortations, includes an important subtext on the sociability of food, drink, chat, and perhaps love\u2014attractions which will lead to behavior decried in sermons that very day. Again religious constraint and traditional license meet, with freedom clearly preferable:\nHow monie hearts this day converts,\r\nO\u2019 Sinners and o\u2019 Lasses!\r\nTheir hearts o\u2019 stane, gin night are gane\r\nAs saft as ony flesh is.\r\nThere\u2019s some are fou o\u2019 love divine;\r\nThere\u2019s some are fou o\u2019 brandy;\r\nAn\u2019 monie jobs that day begin,\r\nMay end in Houghmagandie\r\nSome ither day.\n\u201cThe Jolly Beggars; or, Love and Liberty: A Cantata\u201d goes even further toward affirming freedom through traditional culture. Probably written in 1785 but not published until after Burns\u2019s death, this work combines poetry and song to describe a joyful gathering of society\u2019s rejects: the maimed and physically deformed, prostitutes, and thieves. The work alternates life histories with narrative passages describing the convivial interaction of the social outcasts. Despite their low status, the accounts they give of their lives reveal an unrivaled ebullience and joy. The texts are wedded to traditional and popular tunes. The choice of tunes is not random but underlines the characteristics and experiences described in the words: thus the tinker describes his occupation to the woman he has seduced away from a fiddler to the tune \u201cClout the Caudron,\u201d whose traditional text describes an itinerant fixer of pots and pans, that is, a seducer of women. The assembled company exhibits acceptance of their lots in life, an acceptance made possible because their positions are shared by all present and by the power of drink to soften hardships. Stripped of all the components of human decency, lacking religious or material riches, the beggars are jolly through drink and fellowship, rich in song and story\u2014traditional pastimes. The cantata rushes to a riotous conclusion in which those assembled sing a rousing countercultural chorus that would certainly have received Holy Willie\u2019s harshest censure:\nA fig for those by LAW protected,\r\nLIBERTY\u2019s a glorious feast!\r\nCOURTS for Cowards were erected,\r\nCHURCHES built to please the Priest.\n\u201cThe Jolly Beggars\u201d implicitly speaks to the economic situation of the time: more and more people were made jobless and homeless in the rush for \u201cimprovement,\u201d and the older pattern of taking care of the parish poor had broken down because of greater mobility and greater numbers of needy. Burns offers no solution, but he does illustrate the beggars\u2019 humanity and, above all, their capacity for Life with a capital L\u2014a mode of behavior that is convivial; unites people in story, song, and drink; and exudes delight and joy: traditional culture wins again.\n\r\nBurns worked out in poetry some of his responses to his own culture by showing opposing views of how life should be lived. Descriptions of his own experiences stimulated musings on constraint and freedom. Critical tradition says that John Richmond and Burns observed the beggars in Poosie Nansie\u2019s \u201cThe Holy Fair\u201d may be based on the Mauchline Annual Communion, which was held on the second Sunday of August in 1785; the gathering of the cotter\u2019s family may not describe a specific event but certainly depicts a generalized and typical picture. Thus Burns\u2019s own experiences became the base from which he responded to and considered larger cultural and human issues.\n\r\nThe Kilmarnock edition changed Burns\u2019s life: it sprang him away for a year and a half from the grind of agricultural routine, and it made him a public figure. Burns arrived in the capital city in the heyday of cultural nationalism, and his own person and works were hailed as evidences of a Scottish culture: the Scotsman as a peasant, close to the soil, possessing the \u201csoul\u201d of nature; the works as products of that peasant, in Scots, containing echoes of earlier written and oral Scottish literature.\n\r\nBurns went to Edinburgh to arrange for a new edition of his poems and was immediately taken up by the literati and proclaimed a remarkable Scot. He procured the support of the Caledonian Hunt as sponsors of the Edinburgh edition and set to work with the publisher William Creech to arrange a slightly altered and expanded edition. He was wined and dined by the taste-setters, almost without exception persons from a different class and background from his. He was the \u201chit\u201d of the season, and he knew full well what was going on: he intensified aspects of his rural persona to conform to expectations. He represented the creativity of the peasant Scot and was for a season \u201cExhibit A\u201d for a distinct Scottish heritage.\n\r\nBurns used this time for a variety of experiments, trying on several roles. He entered into what seems to have been a platonic dalliance with a woman of some social standing, Agnes McLehose, who was herself in an ambiguous social situation\u2014her husband having been in Jamaica for some time. The relationship, whatever its true nature, stimulated a correspondence, in which Burns and Mrs. McLehose styled themselves Sylvander and Clarinda and wrote predictably elevated, formulaic, and seemingly insincere letters. Burns lacks conviction in this role; but he met more congenial persons: boon companions, males whom he joined in back-street howffs for lively talk, song, and bawdry.\n\r\nIf the Caledonian Hunt represented the late-18th-century cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, the Crochallan Fencibles, one of the literary and convivial clubs of the day in which members took on assumed names and personae, represented the middle ranks of society where Burns felt more at home. In the egalitarian clubs and howffs Burns met more sympathetic individuals, among them James Johnson, an engraver in the initial stages of a project to print all the tunes of Scotland. That meeting shifted Burns\u2019s focus to song, which became his principal creative form for the rest of his life.\n\r\nThe Edinburgh period provided an interlude of potentiality and experimentation. Burns made several trips to the Borders and Highlands, often being received as a notable and renowned personage. Within a year and a half Burns moved from being a local poet to one with a national reputation and was well on his way to being the national poet, even though much of his writing during this period continued an earlier versifying strain of extemporaneous, occasional poetry. But the Edinburgh period set the ground-work for his subsequent creativity, stimulated his revealing correspondence, and provided him with a way of becoming an advocate for Scotland as anonymous bard.\n\r\nIf Burns were received in Edinburgh as a typical Scot and a producer of genuine Scottish products, that cultural nationalism in turn channeled his love of his country\u2014already expressed in several poems in the Kilmarnock edition\u2014into his songs. Burns\u2019s support for Johnson\u2019s project is infectious; in a letter to a friend, James Candlish, he wrote in November 1787: \u201cI am engaged in assisting an honest Scots Enthusiast, a friend of mine, who is an Engraver, and has taken it into his head to publish a collection of all our songs set to music, of which the words and music are done by Scotsmen.\u2014This, you will easily guess, is an undertaking exactly to my taste.\u2014I have collected, begg\u2019d, borrow\u2019d and stolen all the songs I could meet with.\u2014Pompey\u2019s Ghost, words and music, I beg from you immediately.\u201d Here was a chance to do what he had been doing all his life\u2014wedding text and tune\u2014but for Scotland. Thus Burns became a conscious participant in the antiquarian and cultural movement to gather and preserve evidences of Scottish identity before they were obliterated in the cultural drift toward English language and culture. Burns\u2019s clear preference for traditional culture, and particularly for the freedom it represented, shifted intensity and direction because of the Edinburgh experience. He narrowed his focus from all of traditional culture to one facet\u2014song. Balladry and song were safe artifacts that could be captured on paper and sanitized for polite edification. This approach to traditional culture was distanced and conscious, while his earlier depiction of the larger whole of traditional culture had been immediate, intimate, and largely unconscious. Thus Edinburgh changed his artistic stance, making him more clearly aware of choices and directions as well as a conscious antiquarian.\n\r\nIn all, Burns had a hand in some 330 songs for Johnson\u2019s The Scots Musical Museum (1787-1803), a six-volume work, and for George Thomson\u2019s five-volume A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice (1793-1818). As a nationalistic work, The Scots Musical Museum was designed to reflect Scottish popular taste; like similar publications, it included traditional songs\u2014texts and tunes\u2014as well as songs and tunes by specific authors and composers. Burns developed a coded system of letters for identifying contributors, suggesting to all but the cognoscenti that the songs were traditional. It is often difficult to separate Burns\u2019s work from genuinely traditional texts; he may, for example, have edited and polished the old Scots ballad \u201cTam Lin,\u201d which tells of a man restored from fairyland to his human lover. Many collected texts received a helping hand\u2014fragments were filled out, refrains and phrases were amalgamated to make a whole\u2014and original songs in the manner of tradition were created anew. Burns\u2019s song output was enormous and uneven, and he knew it: \u201cHere, once for all, let me apologies for many silly compositions of mine in this work. Many beautiful airs wanted words.\u201d Yet many of the songs are succinct masterpieces on love, on the brotherhood of man, and on the dignity of the common man\u2014subjects which link Burns with oral and popular tradition on the one hand and on the other with the societal changes that were intensifying distinctions between people.\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable thing about Burns\u2019s songs is their singability, the perspicacity with which words are joined to tune. \u201cMy Love she\u2019s but a lassie yet\u201d provides a superb example: a sprightly tune holds together four loosely connected stanzas about a woman, courtship, drink, and sexual dalliance to create a whole much greater than the sum of the parts. The Song begins:\nMy love she\u2019s but a lassie yet,\r\nMy love she\u2019s but a lassie yet;\r\nWe\u2019ll let her stand a year or twa,\r\nShe\u2019ll no be half sae saucy yet.\nIt concludes, enigmatically:\nWe\u2019re a\u2019 dry wi\u2019 drinking o\u2019t,\r\nWe\u2019re a\u2019 dry wi\u2019 drinking o\u2019t:\r\nThe minister kisst the fidler\u2019s wife,\r\nHe could na preach for thinkin o\u2019t.\u2014\nThe songs are at their best when sung, but there may be delight in text alone, for brilliant stanzas appear most unexpectedly. The chorus of \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d encapsulates the pleasure of reunion, of shared memory:\nFor auld lang syne, my jo,\r\nFor auld lang syne,\r\nWe\u2019ll tak a cup o\u2019 kindness yet\r\nFor auld lang syne.\nThe vignette of a couple aging together\u2014\u201cWe clamb the hill the gither\u201d in \u201cJohn Anderson My Jo\u201d suggests praise of continuity and shared lives. In a similar manner \u201cA Red, Red Rose\u201c depicts a love that is both fresh and lasting: \u201cO my Luve\u2019s like a red, red rose, / That\u2019s newly sprung in June.\u201d\n\r\nBurns\u2019s comment in a letter to Mrs. Dunlop of Dunlop in 1790\u2014\u201cOld Scots Songs are, you know, a favorite study and pursuit of mine\u201d\u2014accurately describes his absorption with song after Edinburgh. He not only collected, edited, and wrote songs but studied them, perusing the extant collections, commenting on provenance, gathering explanatory material, and speculating on the distinct qualities of Scottish song: \u201cThere is a certain something in the old Scots songs, a wild happiness of thought and expression\u201d and of Scottish music: \u201clet our National Music preserve its native features.\u2014They are, I own, frequently wild, & unreduceable to the more modern rules; but on that very eccentricity, perhaps, depends a great part of their effect.\u201d This nationalism did not stop with song but pervaded all Burns\u2019s work after Edinburgh. Certainly the most critically acclaimed product of this period is a work written for Francis Grose\u2019s Antiquities of Scotland (1789-1791). Burns suggested Alloway Kirk as a subject for the work and wrote \u201cTam o\u2019 Shanter\u201d to assure its inclusion.\n\r\n\u201cTam o\u2019 Shanter\u201d is the culmination of Burns\u2019s delight in traditional culture and his selective elevation of parts of that culture in his antiquarian and nationalistic pursuit of Scottish distinctness. The poem retells a legend about a man who comes upon a witches\u2019 Sabbath and unwisely comments on it, alerting the participants to his presence and necessitating their revenge. Burns provides a frame for the legend, localizes it at Alloway Kirk, and peoples it with plausible characters\u2014in particular, the feckless Tam, who takes every opportunity to imbibe with his buddies and avoid going home to wife and domestic responsibilities. Tam stops at a tavern for a drink and sociability and gets caught up in the flow of song, story, and laughter; the raging storm outside makes the conviviality inside the tavern doubly precious. But it is late and Tam must go home and \u201cface the music,\u201d having yet again gotten drunk, no doubt having used money intended for less selfish and more basic purposes. On his way home Tam experiences the events which are central to the legend; the initial convivial scene has provided the context in which such legends might be told. After passing spots enshrined in other legends, he comes upon the witches\u2019 Sabbath revels at the ruins of Alloway Kirk, with the familiar and not quite malevolent devil, styled \u201cauld Nick,\u201d in dog form playing bagpipe accompaniment to the witches\u2019 dance. Burns incorporates skeptical interpolations into the narrative\u2014perhaps Tam is only drunk and \u201cseeing things\u201d\u2014which replicate in poetic form aspects of an oral telling of legends. And the concluding occurrence of Tam\u2019s escapade, the loss of his horse\u2019s tail to the foremost witch\u2019s grasp, demands a response from the reader in much the same way a legend told in conversation elicits an immediate response from the listener. Burns, then, has not only used a legend and provided a setting in which legends might be told but has replicated poetically aspects of a verbal recounting of a legend. And he has used a traditional form to celebrate Scotland\u2019s cultural past. \u201cTam o\u2019 Shanter\u201d may be seen as Burns\u2019s most mature and complex celebration of Scottish cultural artifacts.\n\r\nIf there were a shift of emphasis and attitude toward traditional culture as a result of the Edinburgh experience, there was also continuity. Early and late Burns was a rhymer, a versifier, a local poet using traditional forms and themes in occasional and sometimes extemporaneous productions. These works are seldom noteworthy and are sometimes biting and satiric. He called them \u201clittle trifles\u201d and frequently wrote them to \u201cpay a debt.\u201d These pieces were not thought of as equal to his more deliberate endeavors; they were play, increasingly expected of him as a poet. He probably would have disavowed many now attributed to him, particularly some of the mean-spirited epigrams. Several occasional pieces, however, deserve a closer look for their ability to raise the commonplace to altogether different heights.\n\r\nIn 1786 Burns wrote \u201cTo a Haggis,\u201d a paean to the Scottish pudding of seasoned heart, liver, and lungs of a sheep or calf mixed with suet, onions, and oatmeal and boiled in an animal\u2019s stomach:\nFair fa\u2019 your honest, sonsie face,\r\nGreat Chieftan o\u2019 the Puddin-race!\r\nAboon them a\u2019 ye tak your place,\r\nPainch, tripe, or thairm:\r\nWeel are ye wordy of a grace\r\nAs lang\u2019s my arm.\nVarying accounts claim that the poem was created extempore, more or less as a blessing, for a meal of haggis. Burns\u2019s praise has contributed to the elevation of the haggis to the status of national food and symbol of Scotland. Less well known and dealing with an even more pedestrian subject is \u201cAddress to the Tooth-Ache,\u201d prefaced \u201cWritten by the Author at a time when he was grievously tormented by that Disorder.\u201d The poem is a harangue, delightfully couched in Standard Habbie, beginning: \u201cMy curse on your envenom\u2019d stang, / That shoots my tortur\u2019d gums alang,\u201d a sentiment shared by all who have ever suffered from such a malady.\n\r\nThe many songs, the masterpiece \u201cTam o\u2019 Shanter,\u201d and the continuation and profusion of ephemeral occasional pieces of varying merit all stand as testimony to Burns\u2019s artistry after Edinburgh, albeit an artistry dominated by a selective, focused celebration of Scottish culture in song and legend. This narrowing of focus and direction of creativity suited his changed situation. Burns left Edinburgh in 1788 for Ellisland Farm, near Dumfries, to take up farming again; on August 5 he legally wed Jean Armour, with whom he had seven more children. For the first time in his life he had to become respectable and dependable. Suddenly the carefree life of a bachelor about town ended (although he still sired a daughter in 1791 by a woman named Anne Park), and the trials of life, sanitized in \u201cThe Cotter\u2019s Saturday Night,\u201d became a reality. A year later he also began to work for the Excise; by the fall of 1791 he had completely left farming for excise work and had moved to Dumfries. \u201cThe De\u2019il\u2019s awa wi\u2019 th\u2019 Exciseman,\u201d probably written for Burns\u2019s fellow excise workers and shared with them at a dinner, is a felicitous union of text and tune, lively, rollicking, and affecting. The text plays on the negative view of tax collecting, delighting that the de\u2019il\u2014that couthie bad guy, not Milton\u2019s Satan\u2014has rid the country of the blight.\n\r\nThe Ellisland/Dumfries phase must have been curiously disjointed for Burns. At first he found himself back where he had started\u2014farming and with Jean Armour\u2014as though nothing had changed. But much had changed: Burns was now widely recognized as a poet, as a personage of note, and things were expected of him because of that, such as willingness to share a meal, to stop and talk, or to exhibit his creativity publicly. But he was clearly in an ambiguous class position, working with his hands during the day and entertained for his mind during the evening. Perhaps the mental and physical tensions were just too much. He died on July 21, 1796, probably of endocarditis. He was 37.\n\r\nHis was a hard life, perhaps made both better and worse by his fame. His art catapulted him out of the routine and uncertainty of the agricultural world and gave him more options than most people of his background, enabling him to be trained for the Excise. His renown gave him access to persons and places he might otherwise not have known. He seems to have felt thoroughly at home in all-male society, whether formal, as in the Tarbolton Bachelor\u2019s Club and Crochallan Fencibles, or informal. The male sharing of bawdy song and story cut across class lines. Depicting women as objects, filled with sexual metaphors, bragging about sexual exploits, such bawdy material was a widespread and dynamic part of Scottish traditional culture. Because the sharing of the bawdy material was covert and largely oral, it is impossible to sort out definitively Burns\u2019s role in such works as the posthumously published and attributed volume, The Merry Muses of Caledonia (1799).\n\r\nBurns\u2019s formal education was unusual for an individual in his situation; it was more like the education of the son of a small laird. His references to Scots, English, and Continental writers provide evidence of his awareness of literary tradition; he was remarkably knowledgeable. Lines quoted from Thomas Gray\u2019s \u201cElegy Written in a Country Churchyard\u201c (1751) acknowledge the literary precursor of the \u201cThe Cotter\u2019s Saturday Night,\u201d while Fergusson\u2019s \u201cFarmer\u2019s Ingle\u201d was the direct, though unstated, model. Fergusson provides a less sentimental, more realistic, secular account of one evening\u2019s fireside activities. Fergusson and Ramsay were direct inspirations for Burns\u2019s vernacular works. He inherited particular genres and verse forms from the oral and written traditions, for example, the Spenserian stanza and English Augustan tone of \u201cThe Cotter\u2019s Saturday Night\u201d or the comic elegy and vernacular informality drawn from such models in Standard Habbie as Sempill\u2019s \u201cThe Life and Death of Habbie Simpson,\u201d used in \u201cThe Death and Dying Words of Poor Mailie.\u201d His concern for feeling and sentiment would seem to connect him with the 18th-century cult of sensibility. Living in a time of extraordinary transition clearly enriched Burns\u2019s array of influences\u2014oral and written, in Scots and English. These resources he molded and transmuted in extending the literary traditions he inherited.\n\r\nBoth critics and ordinary people have responded to Burns. Early critical response often placed more emphasis on the man than on his poetry and focused first on his inauspicious origins, later grappling with his character. Burns was seen by some as an ideal, as a model Scot for his revolutionary political, social, and sexual stances. By other critics his revolutionary behavior was viewed negatively: his morality, especially with reference to women and drink, was criticized, and his attitude toward the Kirk and to forms of authority and his use of obscure language were questioned.\n\r\nBurns the man became central because he was at one and the same time typical and atypical\u2014a struggling tenant farmer become tax collector and poet. If he could transcend his birth-right, achieving recognition in his lifetime and posthumous fame thereafter, so might any Scot. Thus Burns became a symbol of every person\u2019s potentiality and even of Scotland\u2019s future as an independent country. To many, Burns became a hero; almost immediately after his death a process of traditionalizing his life began. People told one another about their personal experiences with him; repeated tellings formed a loose-knit legendary cycle which emphasizes his way with women, his impromptu poetic abilities, and his innate humanity. Many apocryphal accounts found their way into early works of criticism. But the legendary tradition has had a particularly dynamic life in a \u201ccalendar custom\u201d called the Burns Supper.\n\r\nShortly after Burns\u2019s death, groups of friends and acquaintances began to gather in his memory. In 1859, the centenary of his birth, memorial events were held all over Scotland and among the Scottish diaspora, and January 25 virtually became a national holiday. The memorial events have taken on a particular structure: there is a meal, one ingredient of which must be the haggis, addressed with Burns\u2019s poem before serving. After the meal there are two speeches with fixed titles, but variable contents: \u201cTo the Immortal Memory\u201d and \u201cTo the Lasses.\u201d \u201cThe Immortal Memory\u201d offers a serious recollection of Burns, usually with emphasis on him as man rather than as poet, and often incorporates legendary instances of his humanity: he is said, for example, to have warned a woman selling ale without a license that the tax collectors would be by late in the day, thereby giving her the opportunity to destroy the evidence. The toast \u201cTo the Lasses\u201d is usually short and humorous, paying tribute to Burns\u2019s way with women and to the many descriptive songs he wrote about them. Interspersed among these speeches and other toasts are performances of Burns\u2019s songs and poems. Typically, the event concludes with the singing of \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d by the assembled company, arrayed in a circle and clasping hands.\n\r\nThe legendary cycle about Burns and the calendar custom in his honor represent an incorporation of Burns into the developing body of oral tradition which inspired some of his own work. The Burns Suppers in particular, held by formal Burns clubs, social clubs, church groups, and gatherings throughout the world, keep Burns alive as symbol for Scotland. Yet this widespread cultural response to Burns is often denigrated by serious critics as \u201cBurnomania.\u201d\n\r\nInitially Burns\u2019s songs were dismissed by the critics as trivial; the bawdry was discounted; poems on sensitive topics were sometimes ignored; vernacular pieces were deemed unintelligible; aspects of his character and life were censured. Subsequent critics have responded to Burns out of altered personal and cultural environments. Wordsworth\u2019s admiration of Burns\u2019s depiction of real life is clearly a selective identification of a quality pertinent to his own poetic ideology. The initial perspective on the songs has changed completely; Burns\u2019s bawdry has been seriously analyzed and seen in the context of a long male tradition of scatological verse; his satires have been lauded for their identification of social inequities; his vernacular works have been praised as the very apogee of the Scottish literary tradition. Critical praise of Burns\u2019s songs and vernacular poetry curiously confirms a long Scottish popular tradition of preference for these works: no Burns Supper is complete without the singing of Burns\u2019s songs and recitation of such works as \u201cTo a Haggis\u201d and \u201cTam o\u2019 Shanter.\u201d National concerns, then, are often implicit in the valuation of Burns: he remains the national poet of Scotland.\n\r\nSince Burns was Scottish, his artistic achievements seem outside the mainstream of 18th-century English literature. Nor does he fit neatly into the Romantic period. As a result, he is often left out of literary histories and anthologies of those periods, the linguistic qualities of his best work providing an additional barrier. But language need not be a stumbling block, as translations of his work attest. Burns\u2019s roots among the people and his concern with social inequalities have made him particularly popular in Russia and China. While Burns and his literary products are firmly rooted in the societal environment from which he came, both continue to be powerful symbols of humanity\u2019s condition; and his utopian cry remains as elusive and appropriate today as when he wrote it:\nThat Man to Man the warld o\u2019er,\r\nShall brothers be for a\u2019 that.\nBurns died in Dumfries, Scotland, in 1796.\n\r\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Scotland"], "School/Period:": ["Romantic"]}}
