He earned a BA from Harvard College, an MFA in creative writing from the University of Iowa, and a PhD in English literature from Harvard University. He is the author of the poetry collections Underworld Lit (Wave Books, 2020), Voyager (2011), and Facts for Visitors (2004).\r\n\u00a0\r\nReddy employs a variety of forms, including syllabics, terza rima, and the prose poem; his poems are collagelike in their variety and inclusiveness. Facts for Visitors was in part composed when Reddy was away from home, and in an interview he described the book as being about the idea of home. Matthew Miller, reviewing the collection for Double Room on webdelsol.com, observed: \u201cReddy\u2019s gravitational center is Southern India, but the poet\u2019s collecting gaze circles out to Europe and further west, involving a host of references.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\nReddy\u2019s poetry and criticism has appeared in\u00a0Harper's,\u00a0The Guardian(UK),\u00a0The New Republic,\u00a0The New York Times, and numerous other venues; in fall 2015, he delivered the Bagley Wright Lectures in Poetry. The recipient of fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Creative Capital Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts, Reddy is currently Professor of English and Creative Writing at the University of Chicago.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
