Grenfell\u2019s artistic pursuits included drawing and poetry. His early poems celebrate his love of hunting and sporting, such as the poem \u201cTo a Black Greyhound.\u201d Grenfell also wrote a series of unpublished essays excoriating high society, and his general distaste for genteel manners may have led to his decision to join the Royal Dragoons in 1910. Grenfell was sent to India and, after the outbreak of World War I, served in France. \u00a0 Grenfell\u2019s courage during the war was notable: he was rewarded a Distinguished Service Order and refused a staff position in order to continue fighting. Best remembered for his war poem, \u201cInto Battle,\u201d Grenfell\u2019s attitude toward war was remarkably patriotic, even idealistic; it stands in sharp contrast to other World War I poets such as Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. Grenfell was seriously wounded during the Battle of Ypres and died in a hospital at Boulogne shortly thereafter. \u201cInto Battle\u201d was printed alongside his obituary in The Times.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
