She is the author of\u00a0Griefmania (Sheep Meadow Press,\u00a02006) and\u00a0Sex Perhaps (Sheep Meadow Press,\u00a02014). Her poems have appeared in the New Yorker, Poetry, Sewanee Review, and Best American Poetry 2008.\nThough she was a practiced prose writer, it was the experience of grief that led her to writing poetry. After the deaths of her husband, the poet George Starbuck, her parents, and others close to her, she found that her \u201cscribbling\u201d in notebooks was taking the form of poetry. Starbuck identifies her subjects in Griefmania as Greek history and \u201cmy interior life.\u201d Joel Brouwer has commented on the \u201creal rawness to the emotion and the energy\u201d in Starbuck\u2019s work.\nStarbuck is the editor, with Elizabeth Meese, of George Starbuck\u2019s poetry collections Visible Ink (2002) and The Works: Poems Selected from Five Decades (2003). She has edited\u00a0the Milford, New Hampshire, weekly newspaper\u00a0Cabinet.\u00a0She has traveled widely and lives in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
