His poems have been translated into more than 30 languages. In English he is represented by numerous collections of poetry, fiction, and essays, including\u00a0The Rose of Time: New and Selected Poems (2010),\u00a0Midnight\u2019s Gate (2002), Unlock (2000),\u00a0Landscape over Zero (1995), Old Snow (1991),\u00a0The August Sleepwalker (1990), and Waves (1985), which have been internationally acclaimed for their subtlety, innovation, and eloquence.\nIn China in the 1970s and \u201980s, he was a leading member of the loosely associated avant-garde movement M\u00e9ngl\u00f3ng Shi R\u00e9n, or \u201cMisty Poets,\u201d so-called for the abstract language and obscure meaning in their poems. Much of his early work, as well as that of other \u201cMisty\u201d poets, appeared in the influential underground journal that he co-founded in 1978, Jintian (Today). The journal was banned after two years of publication, and in 1989 Dao was exiled from China for his perceived influence on the protests that led up to the Tiananmen Square massacre.\nA look at his accomplishments reveals a poet who has since been embraced by the global literary community\u2014he has taught extensively in Europe and the United States, was elected an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and has received awards in Germany, Morocco, and Sweden. Much of his work addresses the topics of freedom and exile, in a way that poet Michael Palmer says \u201cabjures overt political rhetoric while simultaneously keeping faith with his passionate belief in social reform and freedom of the creative imagination.\u201d\nDao has taught at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, the University of California, Davis, and Beloit College in Wisconsin, and he was a Stanford Presidential Lecturer. In 2006, he was permitted to move back to China.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Asia, East"]}}
