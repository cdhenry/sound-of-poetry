The first recipient of a Newbery Medal for a volume of poetry, Willard mingled the \u201cmagical and the mundane\u201d in a technique that \u201crequires a leap of faith on the part of the reader,\u201d according to Sybil Steinberg in a Publishers Weekly interview with the author. As E. Charles Vousden and Laura Ingram pointed out in their Dictionary of Literary Biography entry, \u201cEverything [Willard] writes affirms her belief in the \u2018magic view of life;\u2019 that is, a view of life that incorporates the imagination and stresses the appropriateness of things meant to be taken metaphorically.\u201d\nSuch a stance toward life came at an early age. Born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Willard gained early encouragement from her parents for her artistic leanings. Her father was a renowned university chemistry professor, while her mother ensured that her daughters would form an early love of words, taking them boating at Stony Lake, Michigan, where the family spent many summers. As often as not, Willard\u2019s mother would simply take them out to the middle of the lake and read to them as the boat drifted lazily. \u201cI heard Kingsley\u2019s Water Babies that way, under the best possible conditions,\u201d Willard told Steinberg in her interview. Also following their mother\u2019s encouragement, Willard and her sister began publishing a summer newspaper, going all over their small vacation community to gather newsworthy items, a practice Willard later credited for giving her a good ear for speech and story.\nFrom a very early age, Willard was drawing and creating her own stories, influenced largely by the books she was reading: the stories of Lewis Carroll, and the fantasies of George MacDonald and L. Frank Baum. \u201cTo me, these books were as exotic as the descriptions of court life in \u2018The Sleeping Beauty\u2019 or \u2018Cinderella,\u2019\u201d Willard wrote in an article for Writer magazine. She took the fantasy of her idyllic summers and her readings and blended them with the pragmatism of the scientific discipline she received from her father. \u201cI grew up aware of two ways of looking at the world that are opposed to each other and yet can exist side by side in the same person. One is the scientific view. The other is the magic view.\u201d\nBy the age of seven, Willard had already published her first poem, and as a senior in high school her \u201cA Child\u2019s Star\u201d was published in Horn Book. One of her teenage illustrations was, in fact, used as a Horn Book Christmas card. Upon graduating from high school, Willard studied in the honors English program at the University of Michigan. During her undergraduate years, she wrote and illustrated a children\u2019s book for the student literary magazine. Graduating in 1958, she earned a master\u2019s at Stanford University with a thesis on medieval folk songs, and then went on to complete a doctorate at the University of Michigan. She then took a position teaching creative writing at Vassar College. Married in 1964 to the photographer Eric Lindbloom, she published her first collection of adult poetry, In His Country: Poems, in 1966. Initially, Willard published only adult works\u2014poetry, short stories, and criticism. But with the birth of her son, James, she branched out to writing for children.\nHer first children\u2019s book, Sailing to Cythera and Other Anatole Stories (1974), features \u201can imperturbable youngster named Anatole, whose adventures take him to a world that is a mixture of C.S. Lewis\u2019s Narnia, Lewis Carroll\u2019s Wonderland, and L. Frank Baum\u2019s Oz,\u201d according to Vousden and Ingram. Visiting magical lands, Anatole has a series of adventures involving wizards and sentient animals, battling always for good against evil. This debut children\u2019s title won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1976. Willard followed this success with further Anatole titles, including The Island of the Grass King: The Further Adventures of Anatole (1979), Stranger\u2019s Bread (1977), and Uncle Terrible: More Adventures of Anatole (1982). In the last adventure, Anatole is visiting a friend of his parents called Uncle Terrible. The two are shrunk to the size of an insect and Uncle Terrible even takes on the form of a snake at one point in this \u201cimaginative book,\u201d as Horn Book critic Nancy C. Hammond characterized it. \u201cLike its predecessors,\u201d Hammond concluded, \u201cthe book is beautifully designed and illustrated; the union of text and illustration is inspired.\u201d\nThroughout the 1970s, Willard continued to produce picture books for children, both with prose and verse texts, celebrating everything from Christmas to the adventures of another boy inspired by her own son. In The Snow Rabbit (1975) and The Well-Mannered Balloon (1976), a young protagonist named James is featured. The former book tells of the boy\u2019s attempts to bring a snow sculpture inside, where, of course, it promptly melts. In the second story, a balloon upon which young James has painted the face of a pirate becomes a foe in the middle of the night, and James is forced to pop it. Her first children\u2019s novel, The Highest Hit (1978), recounts the numerous adventures of a plucky little girl named Kate Carpenter, who is, in part, fashioned after the author as a young girl.\nIn 1982 Willard won a Newbery Medal for her picture book A Visit to William Blake\u2019s Inn: Poems for Innocent and Experienced Travelers (1981), which uses both lyrical as well as nonsense verse to tell of events at an enchanted inn. According to Barbara Karlin in the Los Angeles Times, \u201c[William] Blake not only inspired author/poet Nancy Willard to write A Visit to William Blake\u2019s Inn, he is an integral part of many of the poems.\u201d \u201cThe title should not suggest that this picture book is merely a chronicle of the mystical English poet-painter,\u201d Michael Patrick Hearn explained in the Washington Post Book World. \u201cInstead, it is a collection of lyrical nonsense poems inspired by a reading of [Blake\u2019s] Songs of Innocence when Willard was a little girl.\u201d Donald Hall commented in the New York Times Book Review that \u201cin this book, William Blake, poet and engraver, is transformed into an innkeeper. ... These new poems, made with adult skill, successfully embody a 7-year-old\u2019s imagining of the poet who keeps an inn for the imagination. Color and verve are everything; import is nothing.\u201d Reviewing the same title in School Library Journal, Peter Neumeyer called A Visit to William Blake\u2019s Inn a \u201cmagical and original collection\u201d in which poems and pictures, \u201cintegrated in spirit, flow into each other across double-page spreads.\u201d\nWillard produced a succession of well-received children\u2019s books in the 1990s, including reinterpretations of two classic tales. Her version of Beauty and the Beast (1992), set in the late 19th century with Beauty\u2019s father recast as a wealthy New York merchant, was praised by a critic in Kirkus Reviews as a \u201cfelicitous retelling.\u201d Linda Boyles wrote in School Library Journal that Willard\u2019s version \u201cstartles and surprises,\u201d while a Publishers Weekly critic similarly commended Willard\u2019s \u201clavish language,\u201d concluding that the book has \u201cthe assured look of permanence.\u201d In The Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice (1993), Willard updated the traditional tale with a contemporary heroine who rides a bicycle and replaces Disney\u2019s magical brooms with an uncontrollable sewing machine. Gary Wolfe praised Willard\u2019s \u201cingenious verse revision\u201d in Locus, while Michael Dirda described the book as \u201cmasterly\u201d in a Washington Post Book World review. Commending Willard\u2019s retelling, Booklist reviewer Hazel Rochman asserted that \u201cWillard tells her story in lively rhyme that jumps with the unexpected.\u201d\nWillard also displayed her imaginative, lyrical verse in A Starlit Somersault Downhill (1993), a children\u2019s story about a hospitable bear who invites a rabbit into his winter den, though the rabbit soon thinks better of the arrangement and leaves. As Shirley Wilton observed in School Library Journal, \u201cWillard effectively communicates inherent dangers in nature as well as contrasting the safe life with that of risk and adventure.\u201d In An Alphabet of Angels (1994) and The Good-Night Blessing Book (1996) Willard incorporated her own photographs of angel figurines and statuary in a rhyming alphabet and litany of everyday items around the theme of angels. Publishers Weekly contributors praised An Alphabet of Angels for the \u201csheer loveliness of her cryptic poetry\u201d and The Good-Night Blessing Book for Willard\u2019s \u201carresting and sometimes humorous\u201d photographic images.\nIn the pop-up book Gutenberg\u2019s Gift (1995) Willard reinterpreted events precipitating the invention of the printing press. Though historically inaccurate, as noted in the afterword by the curator of The Morgan Library, Willard\u2019s engaging tale describes Gutenberg\u2019s determination to produce a printed Bible for his wife in time for Christmas. The traditions of not only Christmas but other seasons of the year are showcased in Cracked Corn and Snow Ice Cream: A Family Almanac (1996), a nostalgic view of family life in the rural Midwest that a Publishers Weekly critic called \u201cexquisitely designed and compulsively readable. ... An American quilt of fact and folk wisdom.\u201d\nOther popular titles from Willard include The Magic Cornfield (1997), The Tortilla Cat (1997), The Tale I Told Sasha (1999), and The Moon and Riddles Diner and the Sunnyside Caf\u00e9 (2001). Willard turned illustrator/author for The Magic Cornfield, a \u201ccreative risk,\u201d according to a critic for Kirkus Reviews, in which Willard assembles stamps and photographs to help illustrate the travels of an itinerant. \u201cMarching to her own drummer, Willard once again emerges with an unconventional picture book,\u201d declared a reviewer for Publishers Weekly. In The Tortilla Cat Dr. Romero\u2019s children are saved from a deadly illness by a gray cat reciting nonsense verse and dispensing magic tortillas. Ann Welton, writing in School Library Journal, felt that The Tortilla Cat was an \u201ceasy-to-read story with real child appeal,\u201d while a contributor for Publishers Weekly noted that this tale was yet another example of Willard\u2019s \u201cfertile imagination,\u201d and that young readers would be sure \u201cto enjoy the magical element.\u201d\nTurning to verse in The Tale I Told Sasha, Willard created a \u201cpaean to a child\u2019s imagination,\u201d according to Shirley Wilton in School Library Journal. \u201cWillard\u2019s verse seems hewn out of the very rock of imagination,\u201d noted Booklist critic Grace Anne A. DeCandido. In her picture book The Moon and Riddles Diner and the Sunnyside Caf\u00e9, Willard served up thirteen poems presenting Shoofly Sally and the other customers of the diner and caf\u00e9 in question, establishments opened by the moon and sun. \u201cHere, rich metaphors combine with the delicious nonsense of Mother Goose and the frank words and infectious rhythms of folk music and blues,\u201d wrote Gillian Engberg in a Booklist review.\nThe Mouse, the Cat, and Grandmother\u2019s Hat (2003) is a whimsical tale that borrows from \u201cThe House that Jack Built\u201d and \u201cThe Gingerbread Man.\u201d A birthday party comes to a halt when a mouse hiding under grandmother\u2019s bonnet makes an escape. The cat, while chasing the mouse, upsets the girl carrying grandma\u2019s birthday cake, which falls to the floor, grows arms, and rolls away, with everyone in pursuit. Willard\u2019s Cinderella\u2019s Dress (2003) is a retelling of the classic story, but in her version, Cinderella\u2019s first dress is created by two magpies with a nest full of pretty collectibles, including everything from bits of lace and flower petals to shiny paper. Their beautiful dress of paper is destroyed by the stepsisters, but the fairy godmother saves the day with another. In this story, the magpies discover that the gold ring they have been holding belonged to Cinderella\u2019s mother, and they give it to the girl. A Kirkus Reviews critic felt that Willard\u2019s version, \u201cwith its rich details of shimmery things will be a lovely addition to any fairytale collection.\u201d\nThe Tale of Paradise Lost: Based on the Poem by John Milton (2004) is a book in which Willard\u2019s retellings made the biblical story of Adam and Eve more accessible to middle grade readers. Like Milton, she began with Satan already in hell, then posited him in Paradise, explaining his rebellion and the creation. A Publishers Weekly contributor wrote that Willard \u201cremains faithful to Milton\u2019s version of the events, even as she softens his tone.\u201d\nSweep Dreams (2005) is a story for young children in which a lonely man falls in love with a red broom he finds at the supermarket. He takes her to his home, where he dances with her until she is stolen by a stranger who orders her to dance so that he can exploit her. The broom eventually returns home, but she is no longer happy confined to the house. The man loves her so much that he frees her, and she flies to the sky to sweep away clouds, clean stars, and polish rainbows. School Library Journal contributor Jane Barrer wrote that \u201cWillard\u2019s lyrical tale is a delightful love story.\u201d\nIn her essay for Writer, Willard also reaffirmed another major principle that has shaped the entirety of her work\u2014magic: \u201cMost of us grow up and put magic away with other childish things. But I think we can all remember a time when magic was as real to us as science, and the things we couldn\u2019t see were as important as the things we could. ... I believe that all small children and some adults hold this view together with the scientific ones. I also believe that the great books for children come from those writers who hold both.\u201d\nWillard also published adult novels. The first, Things Invisible to See (1984), is set in the late 1930s and early 1940s and tells the story of a pair of twin brothers, Ben and Willie\u2014one gregarious, intuitive, sentimental, the other shy, reserved, methodical. The story is also about a girl named Clare, who becomes accidentally paralyzed when Ben hits her on the head with a baseball and who later falls in love with him. \u201cThe point of this luminous first novel,\u201d wrote Ann Tyler in the Detroit News, \u201cis that the miraculous and the everyday often co-exist, or overlap, or even that they\u2019re one and the same.\u201d While the novel is filled with out-of-the-ordinary events, \u201cwhat makes this book so moving,\u201d according to Tyler, \u201cis not the presence of the magical in the ordinary, but the presence of the ordinary in the magical.\u201d Michiko Kakutani commented in the New York Times that Willard \u201cwrites of small-town life during World War II with a genuine nostalgia\u2014neither sentimental nor contrived\u2014for the innocence Americans once possessed; and she makes a teen-age love story ... reverberate, gently, with larger, darker questions about the human condition.\u201d The reviewer praised Willard\u2019s \u201cpictures of daily life so precisely observed that they leave after-images in the reader\u2019s mind,\u201d and noted that \u201cin the end, the novel probably most resembles an old-fashioned crazy quilt\u2014eclectic and a little over-embroidered, but all in all a charming work of improvisation, held together by the radiance of its creator\u2019s sensibility.\u201d\nIn Sister Water (1993), Willard\u2019s second novel for adults, the author explored the challenge to a family\u2019s love and cohesion that are posed by death. As 70-something Jesse, who is now suffering from progressive memory loss and troubling encounters with the angel of death, awaits her calling into the next world, her daughter copes with the loss of her husband in a tragic automobile accident and the haunting dreams that follow. While praising Willard\u2019s characterizations, Gregory Blake Smith noted in the New York Times Book Review that \u201cthe reader is teased with the idea that the quirky allure of image and character will ultimately coalesce into a vision\u201d uniting the literal and metaphoric lands Willard had created. \u201cWe wait for revelation, but ... the novel keeps its secrets to itself.\u201d\nIn the Salt Marsh: Poems (2004), Willard\u2019s 10th volume of verse for adults, \u201creturns to the gardens, riversides, parables and Northeastern landscapes whose patterns she has made her own,\u201d reported a Publishers Weekly contributor. In a Library Journal review, Diane Scharper described the poems \u201cLadybugs\u201d and \u201cThe Butterfly Forest,\u201d in which Willard alludes to religion and Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, as \u201celegant in their simplicity.\u201d Scharper further characterized Willard\u2019s poetry as being \u201ccharming but not whimsical, truthful but not prosaic, and, above all, fresh.\u201d Booklist contributor Ray Olson reviewed four of the poems, including \u201cThe Way She Left Us,\u201d \u201cThe House,\u201d \u201cLove in America,\u201d and \u201cThe Migration of Bicycles,\u201d writing that \u201cthese four masterpieces are matched by several others in this invaluable collection.\u201d\nIn Telling Time: Angels, Ancestors, and Stories (1993), a collection of 13 essays, Willard offers personal reflections on the process of creative writing. Through the use of poetry, parable, and fiction, she conveys the maxim: \u201cShow don\u2019t tell; and write from what you know.\u201d This remains sound advice for aspiring writers, and one that informed Willard\u2019s career in her adult poetry and novels as well as in her prolific writing for children.\nWillard died on February 19, 2017, in Poughkeepsie, NY.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
