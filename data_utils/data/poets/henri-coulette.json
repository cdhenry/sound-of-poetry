He was born in Los Angeles, Calfornia, and he earned a BA from California State University in Los Angeles in 1952. He then studied at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. He taught English at California State University in Los Angeles for almost 30 years.\nCoulette\u2019s first volume of poetry, The War of the Secret Agents and Other Poems (1966), won the Lamont Poetry Prize and received significant critical attention. Coulette was described as \u201ca poet to watch\u201d by Dudley Fitts in the New York Times Book Review. Discussing the title poem in Coulette\u2019s collection The War of the Secret Agents and Other Poems, Fitts claimed to be \u201cfrustrated throughout [this poem] by opacities of allusion and reference.\u201d However, he also praised it: \u201cIsolated passages show power. The poem is skillfully written.\u201d And Mother Mary Anthony wrote in Western Humanities Review that The War of the Secret Agents and Other Poems is \u201cwork of a high order\u2014disciplined originality and strong patterning, layered irony and powerful understatement.\u201d\nCoulette\u2019s\u00a0other poetry collections are The Collected Poems of Henri Coulette, edited by Donald Justice and Robert Mezey (1990), published posthumously, and The Family Goldschmitt (1971). He also edited Character and Crisis: A Contemporary Reader (1966), The Unstrung Lyre: Interviews With Fourteen Poets (1965), and Midland: Twenty-five Years of Fiction and Poetry From Writing Workshops of the State University of Iowa (1961).\nHe died in South Pasadena, California, on March 26, 1988.\n", "attrs": {}}
