He earned degrees from the University of Nebraska and the University of Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. Langan is the author of\u00a0Freezing\u00a0(2001),\u00a0Notes on Exile and Other Poems\u00a0(2005),\u00a0Meet Me at the Happy Bar\u00a0(2009), and\u00a0What It Looks Like, How It Flies\u00a0(2013).\nIn Prairie Schooner,\u00a0Nicky Beer wrote, \u201cThough the landscapes of the poems are distinctly interior and psychological, one cannot help but read this interior as a uniquely American one. Much of the anomie and anxiety in\u00a0Notes on Exile and Other Poems\u00a0seems to be the product of a culture where rapture is trivialized by its proximity with the quotidian, and language is often a treacherous, euphemistic subterfuge.\u00a0Langan\u00a0is clearly developing his considerable gift to elegize the fragmented, desperate, and soulful American poetic voice on the cusp of the twenty-first century.\u201d\nReviewing\u00a0for MAKE Magazine,\u00a0Weston Cutter noted, \u201cWhat makes Langan\u2019s\u00a0Meet Me at the Happy Bar\u00a0stand so far out from other collections is not just the whirligig zip and whiplash he causes by putting disparate lines next to and on top of each other, nor the ache for some substantial meaning to bedazzle all this flotsam onto, some foundation to leave the heaps upon. No, what makes this all such a big deal is the explicit emphasis on now, on time.\u201d\nLangan teaches at the University of Nebraska MFA in Writing program. He is founder and director of the Seven Doctors Project, based in Omaha, in which area writers guide healthcare workers in a writing workshop.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
