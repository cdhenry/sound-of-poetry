Howe grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and studied at Stanford University.\u00a0\u201cIf someone is alone reading my poems, I hope it would be like reading someone\u2019s notebook. A record. Of a place, beauty, difficulty. A familiar daily struggle,\u201d Fanny Howe explained in a 2004 interview with the Kenyon Review. Indeed, more than a subject or theme, the process of recording experience is central to Howe\u2019s poetry. Her work explores grammatical possibilities, and its rhythms are generated from associative images and sounds.\n\r\nHowe\u2019s collections of poetry include Love and I (2019), The Needle\u2019s Eye (2016), Second Childhood (2014), Come and See\u00a0(2011), On the Ground (2004), Gone (2003), Selected Poems (2000), Forged (1999), Q (1998), One Crossed Out (1997), O\u2019Clock (1995), and The End (1992). Critic Jordan Davis lauds the manner in which revelatory thought is presented in Gone: \u201cHowe enacts what the South American poet Jorge Guinheime called hasosismo, or the art of the fallen limb, in which startling insights emerge and are subsequently concealed.\u201d Critic Kimberley Lamm, discussing the poem \u201cDoubt,\u201d writes, \u201cFanny Howe\u2019s work is unique in contemporary poetry for its exploration of religious faith, ethics, politics, and suffering.\u201d\u00a0Second Childhood\u00a0(2014) was selected as a finalist for the National Book Award.\nHowe is the author of many novels, including Nod, The Deep North, Famous Questions, Saving History, and Indivisible. She has written short stories, books for young adults, and the collection of literary essays\u00a0The Wedding Dress: Meditations on Word and Life\u00a0(2003) and\u00a0The Winter Sun: Notes on a Vocation\u00a0(2009).\n\r\nShe has received awards from the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Poetry Foundation, the California Council for the Arts, and the Village Voice, as well as fellowships from the Bunting Institute and the MacDowell Colony. Her\u00a0Selected Poems\u00a0won the 2001 Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize.\u00a0In 2001 and 2005, Howe was shortlisted for the Griffin Poetry Prize. In 2008 she won an Award in Literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. She was awarded the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize in 2009.\nHowe taught for almost 20 years in Boston, at MIT, Tufts University, and elsewhere, before taking a job at the University of California at San Diego, where she is professor emerita. In 2012 she was the inaugural visiting writer in the Creative Writing Program at the University of Massachusetts-Boston. Her papers are housed at Stanford University.\u00a0She lives in Massachusetts.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"], "School/Period:": ["Language Poetry"]}}
