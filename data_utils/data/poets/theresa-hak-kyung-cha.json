Her family immigrated to the United States\u00a0in 1962.\u00a0Cha earned her BA and MA in comparative literature and her BA and MFA in art from the University of California, Berkeley.\nCha\u2019s work incorporates multiple perspectives of culture, history, and artistic media. Her art is interdisciplinary, combining elements of various media and theoretic approaches, culminating as performance pieces, films, concrete poetry, and artists\u2019 books. One such piece is the experimental novel, Dict\u00e9e (1982), for which she is most well known. Drawing on a diverse range of cultural and spiritual exposure, Cha\u2019s body of work is rich with linguistic investigation amidst themes of exile, displacement, and redemption.\nOne week after the publication of Dict\u00e9e, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha was murdered in New York City at the age of 31. Despite her unfortunate and early death, Cha\u2019s collection of films, writings, and visual art is substantial, and is housed at the University of California, Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
