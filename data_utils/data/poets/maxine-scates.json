After graduation she moved to Oregon where she earned an MFA from the University of Oregon.\nShe is the author of the poetry collections My Wilderness (University of Pittsburgh Press, forthcoming 2021), Undone (2011), Black Loam (2005) and\u00a0Toluca Street (1989). Vern Rutsala, commenting on Undone, writes, \u201cWhile the language is rich and various the poems are also admirable in the way they confront everyday life with a clear and steady eye, weaving the past and present together seamlessly and giving us views of American society usually ignored in contemporary poetry.\u201d\nScates is also coeditor of Holding Our Own: The Selected Poems of Ann Stanford (2001), which she edited with another of Stanford\u2019s former students, David Trinidad.\u00a0Her poems have been widely published in journals throughout the country, and her work has received the Agnes Lynch Starrett Poetry Prize, the Oregon Book Award for Poetry, the Lyre Prize, and a Pushcart Prize. She has taught at Lane Community College, Lewis and Clark College, and most recently Reed College. She has lived in Eugene, Oregon since 1973.\ufeff\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
