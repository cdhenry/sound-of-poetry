Formally adept, Bergman uses narrative techniques to create moments of personal intimacy within larger mythic and political frames. Bergman\u2019s work frequently treats both personal history and queer sexuality; in an interview with Gay Life, he stated, \"Memoir is one of the earlier forms that LGBT people occupied themselves with and is central for forming the notion of being gay. For LGBT people, poetry allowed (historically) a depth of expression that was not allowed in prose, and people could write about same-sex love in various ways. When we want to look at what is the deepest expression of a culture, we look to its poetry.\"  \u00a0 Bergman\u2019s poetry collections include Heroic Measures (1998) and Cracking the Code (1985), which won the George Elliston Poetry Prize. With Katia Sainson, he translated The Selected Poems of Jean S\u00e9nac (2010). His scholarly writing includes The Violet Hour: The Violet Quill and the Making of Gay Culture (2004), Gaiety Transfigured: Gay Self-Representation in American Literature (1991), and Camp Grounds: Style and Homosexuality (1993). \u00a0 Bergman edited Gay American Autobiography: Writings from Whitman to Sedaris (2009) and Edmund White\u2019s The Burning Library: Essays (1994). With Daniel Mark Epstein, he edited The Heath Guide to Poetry (1983). Bergman also served as an editor for the \u201cLiving Out: Gay & Lesbian Autobiography\u201d series, from the University of Wisconsin Press. \u00a0 At Towson State University, Bergman cofounded the program in cultural studies and directed the program in lesbian and gay studies. He lives in Baltimore, Maryland.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
