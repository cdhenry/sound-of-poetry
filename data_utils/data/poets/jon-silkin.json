He studied at Wycliffe College and Dulwich College. Silkin is the author of over 30 poetry collections and translations, including The Peaceable Kingdom (1954), The Two Freedoms (1958), The Re-Ordering of the Stones (1961), Nature With Man (1965), winner of the Faber Memorial Prize, and Watersmeet (1994). Silkin\u2019s poems often focus on his Jewish identity, a sense of dislocation, and the divide between humankind and nature.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSilkin edited anthologies of poetry written in response to World War I, including Out of Battle (1978) and The Penguin Book of First World War Poetry (1979). In 1952, Silkin founded the magazine Stand, which he edited, except for the magazine\u2019s three-year break, until his death.
