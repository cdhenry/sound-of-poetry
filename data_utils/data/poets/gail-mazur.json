Her poems have been widely anthologized, including in several Pushcart Prize anthologies, the Best American Poetry series, and Robert Pinsky\u2019s Essential Pleasures.\u00a0\nThe National Book Award Citation for They Cant Take That Away from Me reads: \u201cColloquial as well as eloquent, pitch-perfect no matter how delicate her material, Gail Mazur has found a way to write that is completely responsive to her remarkable qualities of mind, She gives us the exact \u2018feel\u2019 of contemporary life in our disquieting republic, the uncanny way in which love, hope, and endurance are shot through by contingency, dread, and estrangement. Full of warmth, humor, and a dry-eyed toughness, her work is a superbly personal and civic achievement.\u201d\u00a0\nIn 1973, Masur founded the Blacksmith House Poetry Series in Harvard Square. As an activist with her late husband\u2014the artist Michael Mazur\u2014and others, she cofounded, in 1968, Artists Against Racism and the War, and later they were activists for a Nuclear Freeze. Blacksmith House became, with its weekly readings, a center of poetry life, bringing national and international writers to read in a lively informal atmosphere. Blacksmith House has presented benefit readings for, among other issues, the fight for AIDS research. Speaking of the Blacksmith House, now under the direction of poet Andrea Cohen, Mazur has said, \u201cTo keep things going, to support and validate the work of poets, to make a dent in the isolation writers feel in their working life (as Stanley Kunitz wrote, \u2018Art withers without fellowship\u2019), that was what I wanted. To last.\u00a0 The Blacksmith reading series helps provide something like fellowship, it insists on bringing poetry into the world.\u201d\nMazur has received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Bunting Institute of Radcliffe College, and the Radcliffe Institute. She is Distinguished Senior Writer in Residence in Emerson College\u2019s graduate program and has served for many years on the Writing Committee of the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
