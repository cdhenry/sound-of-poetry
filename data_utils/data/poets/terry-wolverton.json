She studied at the University of Detroit, the University of Toronto, Thomas Jefferson College, and the Sagaris Collective in Plainsfield, Vermont. She has published many collections of poetry, including Shadow and Praise (2007), Embers: A Novel in Poetry (2003), Mystery Bruise (1999), and Black Slip (1992), which was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award. Her novels include Stealing Angel (2011),\u00a0The Labrys Reunion (2009), and Bailey\u2019s Beads (1996). Her memoir, Insurgent Muse: Life and Art at the Woman\u2019s Building (2002), was chosen as one of the Best Books of the Year by the Los Angeles Times, won the Judy Grahn Award from Publishing Triangle, and was a finalist for the Lambda Book Award.\nWolverton\u2019s free verse, often short-lined, poems frequently explore themes of sexuality, identity, and place. \u201cShadow and Praise unfolds its \u2018bittersweet beat\u2019 in an end-line-word to first-line-word chain,\u201d observed poet Elena Karina Byrne. \u201cLike consciousness itself divining language, this construct delights in what it may find hidden between the \u2018small gaps of breath\u2019 of perception.\u201d In an interview with Owen Keehnen discussing her novel Bailey\u2019s Beads, Wolverton noted the larger concerns of her work: \u201cI wanted to talk about the post-modern notion of how identity is constructed. I think that for gays and lesbians, and this is a big generality, we\u2019re somewhat more conscious of those constructions. \u2026 I\u2019ve had to carve out my own spot and consciously make a break from certain family and societal conditions. The inventive aspects of identity have been more conscious for me.\u201d\nWith novelist Robert Drake, Wolverton has co-edited numerous anthologies, including His: Brilliant New Fiction by Gay Writers (1995), Hers: Brilliant New Fiction by Lesbian Writers (1995), and Blood Whispers: LA Writers on AIDS (1991). She collaborated with choreographer Heidi Ducker and Collage Dance Theater on the performances subVersions and Under Eden.\nLong active in the California writing community, Wolverton began a 13-year involvement with the Feminist Studio Workshop at the Woman\u2019s Building in Los Angeles in 1976, eventually serving as the organization\u2019s executive director. She was also a founder of the Visions and Revisions Writing Program at Connexxus Women\u2019s Center/Centro de Mujeres, the Perspectives Writing Program at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, and the creative writing center Writers at Work.\nWolverton lives in Los Angeles, where she has taught in the Antioch University Los Angeles MFA Writing Program and Writers at Work.\r\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
