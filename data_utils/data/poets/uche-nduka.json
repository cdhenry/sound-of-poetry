Raised bilingual in Igbo and English, he earned his BA from the University of Nigeria and his MFA from Long Island University, Brooklyn. He left Nigeria in 1994 and settled in Germany after winning a fellowship from the Goethe Institute. He lived in Germany and Holland for the next decade and immigrated to the United States in 2007. Nduka is the author of numerous collections of poetry and prose, including Living in Public\u00a0(2018),\u00a0Nine East (2013), Ijele (2012), and eel on reef (2007), all of which were published after he arrived in the United States. Earlier collections include Heart\u2019s Field (2005); If Only the Night (2002); Chiaroscuro (1997), which won the Association of Nigerian Authors Poetry Prize; The Bremen Poems (1995); Second Act (1994); and Flower Child (1988). Belltime Letters (2000) is a collection of prose.\u00a0His work has been translated into German, Finnish, Italian, Dutch, and Romanian.\nNduka\u2019s work is notable for its surrealist energy and political urgency. According to Joyelle McSweeney,\u00a0\u201cTo my reading, all of Nduka\u2019s work is Surreal, and in this sense it is all political. The real is not paraphrased or commented on by Surrealism but convulses through it. The real in Nduka\u2019s work carries the resonance not only of his Nigerian identity and experience of political violence but also the dislocation of the \u00e9migr\u00e9 and the frightening power relations of intimacy as mapped onto the lyric.\u201d Nduka himself has said, \u201cSo far I just like doing my own thing and not buying into the hype of either formal or informal English; traditional or avant-garde usages. I enact a language style that suits my mood and the subjects I am interested in. Linguistically it seems there are a lot of trenches that have not been explored in poems/poetry. I keep attempting to investigate them. I don\u2019t want to feel like people expect me to write in English timidly.\u201d Nduka lives in Brooklyn.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
