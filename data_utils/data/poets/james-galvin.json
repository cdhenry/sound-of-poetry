He has also published\u00a0the\u00a0novel\u00a0Fencing the Sky (1999),\u00a0and The Meadow (1992), a prose meditation on the landscape of the Wyoming-Colorado border and the people who live there.\n\r\nGalvin\u2019s work is infused with the genuine realities of the western landscape, while at the same time not shirking difficult questions of faith, the vicissitudes of life, and shifting intimacies. Poet and critic Mark Tredinnick commented, \u201cAll Galvin\u2019s writing arises from and expresses a musical engagement with the world.\u201d Tredinnick also found Galvin\u2019s work to be \u201cprofoundly ecological,\u201d stating that \u201c[h]is writing, particularly The Meadow, but all of his prose and poetry, starts from the principle . . . that we are the land\u2019s, not the other way around.\u201d\n\r\nGalvin has won fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation for his poetry. For many years he has been on the permanent faculty at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, spending part of the year in Iowa City, Iowa, and the remainder in Tie Siding, Wyoming, where he grew up and still ranches.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
