Avoiding the sentimentality and jingoism of many war poets, Sassoon wrote of the horror and brutality of trench warfare and contemptuously satirized generals, politicians, and churchmen for their incompetence and blind support of the war. He was also well known as a novelist and political commentator. In 1957 he was awarded the Queen\u2019s Medal for Poetry.\n\r\nBorn into a wealthy Jewish family, sometimes called the \u201cRothschilds of the East\u201d because the family fortune was made in India, Sassoon lived the leisurely life of a cultivated country gentleman before the World War I, pursuing his two major interests, poetry and fox hunting. His early work, which was privately printed in several slim volumes between 1906 and 1916, is considered minor and imitative, heavily influenced by John Masefield (of whose work\u00a0The Daffodil Murderer\u00a0is a parody).\n\r\nFollowing the outbreak of the World War I, Sassoon served with the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, seeing action in France in late 1915. He received a Military Cross for bringing back a wounded soldier during heavy fire. After being wounded in action, Sassoon wrote an open letter of protest to the war department, refusing to fight any more. \u201cI believe that this War is being deliberately prolonged by those who have the power to end it,\u201d he wrote in the letter. At the urging of Bertrand Russell, the letter was read in the House of Commons. Sassoon expected to be court-martialed for his protest, but poet\u00a0Robert Graves\u00a0intervened on his behalf, arguing that Sassoon was suffering from shell-shock and needed medical treatment. In 1917, Sassoon was hospitalized.\n\nCounter-Attack and Other Poems\u00a0collects some of Sassoon\u2019s best war poems, all of which are \u201charshly realistic laments or satires,\u201d writes Margaret B. McDowell in the\u00a0Dictionary of Literary Biography.\u00a0The later collection\u00a0The War Poems of Siegfried Sassoon\u00a0included 64 poems of the war, most written while Sassoon was in hospital recovering from his injuries. Public reaction to Sassoon\u2019s poetry was fierce. Some readers complained that the poet displayed little patriotism, while others found his shockingly realistic depiction of war to be too extreme. Even pacifist friends complained about the violence and graphic detail in his work. But the British public bought the books because, in his best poems, Sassoon captured the feeling of trench warfare and the weariness of British soldiers for a war that seemed never to end. \u201cThe dynamic quality of his war poems,\u201d according to a critic for the\u00a0Times Literary Supplement, \u201cwas due to the intensity of feeling which underlay their cynicism.\u201d \u201cIn the history of British poetry,\u201d McDowell wrote, \u201c[Sassoon] will be remembered primarily for some one hundred poems \u2026 in which he protested the continuation of World War I.\u201d\n\r\nAfter the war, Sassoon became involved in Labour Party politics, lectured on pacifism, and continued to write. His most successful works of this period were his trilogy of autobiographical novels,\u00a0The Memoirs of George Sherston.\u00a0In these, he gave a thinly-fictionalized account, with little changed except names, of his wartime experiences, contrasting them with his nostalgic memories of country life before the war and recounting the growth of his pacifist feelings. Some have maintained that Sassoon\u2019s best work is his prose, particularly the first two Sherston novels.\u00a0Memoirs of a Fox Hunting Man\u00a0was described by a critic for the\u00a0Springfield Republican\u00a0as \u201ca novel of wholly fresh and delightful content,\u201d and Robert Littrell of\u00a0Bookman\u00a0called it \u201ca singular and a strangely beautiful book.\u201d\n\r\nThat book\u2019s sequel was also well received. The\u00a0New Statesman\u00a0critic called\u00a0Memoirs of an Infantry Officer \u201ca document of intense and sensitive humanity.\u201d In a review for the\u00a0Times Literary Supplement,\u00a0after Sassoon\u2019s death, one critic wrote: \u201cHis one real masterpiece,\u00a0Memoirs of an Infantry Officer\u00a0\u2026 is consistently fresh. His self scrutiny is candid, critical, and humourous. \u2026 If Sassoon had written as well as this consistently, he would have been a figure of real stature. As it is, English literature has one great work from him almost by accident.\u201d\n\r\nSassoon\u2019s critical biography of Victorian novelist and poet\u00a0George Meredith\u00a0found a similarly positive reception. In this volume, he recounted numerous anecdotes about Meredith, portraying him vividly as a person as well as an author: \u201cThe reader lays the book down with the feeling that a great author has become one of his close neighbors,\u201d wrote G.F. Whicher in the\u00a0New York Herald Tribune Weekly Book Review.\u00a0The critical portions of the book were also praised, though some found the writing careless. But the\u00a0New Yorker\u00a0critic noted Sassoon\u2019s \u201cfresh and lively literary criticism,\u201d and the reviewer for the\u00a0Times Literary Supplement\u00a0declared that \u201cMr. Sassoon gives us a poet\u2019s estimate, considered with intensity of insight, skilfully shaped as biography, and written with certainty of style.\u201d\n\r\nIn 1957 Sassoon became a convert to Catholicism, though for some time before his conversion, his spiritual concerns had been the predominant subject of his writing. These later religious poems are usually considered markedly inferior to those written between 1917 and 1920. Yet\u00a0Sequences\u00a0(published shortly before his conversion) has been praised by some critics. Derek Stanford, in\u00a0Books and Bookmen,\u00a0claimed that \u201cthe poems in\u00a0Sequences\u00a0constitute some of the most impressive religious poetry of this century.\u201d\n\r\nSpeaking of Sassoon\u2019s war poetry in a 1981 issue of the\u00a0Spectator,\u00a0P.J. Kavanagh claimed that \u201ctoday they ring as true as they ever did; it is difficult to see how they could be better.\u201d Looking back over Sassoon\u2019s long literary career, Peter Levi wrote in\u00a0Poetry Review: \u201cOne can experience in his poetry the slow, restless ripening of a very great talent; its magnitude has not yet been recognised. \u2026 He is one of the few poets of his generation we are really unable to do without.\u201d\nSassoon died in 1967 from stomach cancer. His papers are held at University of Cambridge.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Georgian"]}}
