She earned a BA at Tufts University and an MFA at the City College of New York.\nIn her lush, wryly vulnerable poems, Broder embraces the darkness of daily life. Explaining her writing process\u2014Broder prefers to compose while in transit\u2014in a 2012 conversation with Peter Moysaenko for BOMB, Broder states, \u201cI\u2019m a perfectionist. A nice desk in a pretty room doesn\u2019t work for me, because the expectation that IT\u2019S TIME TO MAKE ART is too high. I have to outwit myself and act casual\u2014to approach with a sense of play. That doesn\u2019t mean I never get \u201cserious.\u201d It\u2019s just a question of outrunning the shit-talker within. There\u2019s something about writing on the subway, or while walking, that frees the subconscious. It\u2019s sort of a rebellion thing, like, I\u2019m not really supposed to be doing this here now.\u201d In that BOMB profile, Moysaenko describes Meat Heart, Broder\u2019s second collection, as \u201ca sleek machine hauling gnarly cargo\u2014persons, places, things, things, things. \u2026 Because\u00a0Melissa\u2019s projections\u2014more pop personist than personal\u2014lay forth, and are laid upon, a sense of spirit contingent on body, we get more than love songs. We get skewed prayers. We get banquets. Transfigurations and showdowns, tough ghosts and fake heavens, escapades through culture-struck waking dreams and flaming cities of memory.\u201d\nBroder is the author of several poetry collections, including When You Say One Thing but Mean Your Mother (2010), Scarecrone (2014), and Last Sext (2016), and the essay collection So Sad Today (2016), based on her posts on Twitter. \u201cEmily Dickinson would have been great at Twitter,\u201d Broder states in a conversation with Bryn Lovitt for a 2016 Vanity Fair profile, noting the 140-character economy of the form.\nBroder has served as director of media and special projects at NewHive, a publicist for Penguin, editor in chief for La Petite Zine, and organizer of the Polestar Poetry Series. She lives in Venice, California.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
