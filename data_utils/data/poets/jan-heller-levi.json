She earned a BA from Sarah Lawrence College and is the author of the poetry collections Once I Gazed at You in Wonder (1999), which received the Walt Whitman Award from the Academy of American Poets, and Skyspeak: Poems (2005). Conversational and intimate, Levi\u2019s poems often address familial concerns and aspects of a woman\u2019s life. Alice Fulton noted of Once I Gazed at You in Wonder that \u201cthe book\u2019s tone modulates from elegiac to self-mockery, reticent to funny, as Levi considers not only grief and love, but the unbidden, bereft emotions in between.\u201d\nLevi teaches in the MFA program at Hunter College. She is married to the writer Christoph Keller and divides her time between St. Gallen, Switzerland, and New York City.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
