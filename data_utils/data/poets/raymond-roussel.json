His work is notable for its inscrutable surfaces and extreme density; its wealth of puns, double entendres, and homonyms; and its outr\u00e9 subject matter. In Bookforum,Eric Banks described \u201cRoussel\u2019s strange voice,\u201d with \u201cits peculiar start-and-stop pace, its finicky, oddly impersonal flatness of tone (reminiscent of Ashbery and another Roussel aficionado, Harry Mathews), its bookish exactitude of often arcane vocabulary, the mesmerizing rhythm of its syntax.\u201d Mark Ford, Roussel\u2019s biographer, has linked Roussel\u2019s flat or affectless tone to his goal for \u201cabsolute concision, but also absolute transparency. \u2026 In other words, there is no personal comment or sense of authorial perspective on what is being described, so, the first time, the reader\u2019s attention is focused entirely on what is being presented,\u201d which are frequently fantastical and bizarre scenes and landscapes.  \u00a0 Roussel was born into a wealthy Parisian family. He famously invented an early, extremely opulent type of RV, the maison roulante or \u201cland yacht,\u201d which allowed him, in Ford\u2019s words, \u201cto travel, almost literally, without traveling at all.\u201d Roussel never achieved fame in his lifetime, despite paying publishers to publish handsome editions of his books and his own numerous attempts to stage his works. The surrealists befriended him, though he legendarily described their work as un peu obscur (a little obscure). Still, Roussel has long been important to avant-garde writers and artists, including Marcel Duchamp, Jean Cocteau, and writers such as Alain Robbe-Grillet associated with nouveau roman moment and those, such as Georges Perec, connected to Oulipo. John Ashbery has long championed Roussel\u2019s work, and his influence can be detected in New York School poets such as Kenneth Koch, who translated a canto of Nouvelle Impressions d\u2019Afrique.  \u00a0 Roussel\u2019s best-known books include Impressions d\u2019Afrique (1910) and Locus Solus (1914). His long poem Nouvelle Impressions d\u2019Afrique (1932) famously includes long digressions and footnotes in rhyming alexandrines, each of which can run to hundreds of lines. Published posthumously, Comment j'ai \u00e9crit certains de mes livres (1935, How I Wrote Certain of My Books,translated by Trevor Winkfield, 1975) revealed some of Roussel\u2019s favored methods of composition, including use of the metagram or the \u201cpairing of two words taken in different senses\u201d and the ways in which unforeseen narratives might be contained in the result. New translations of Impressions of Africa (2011, translated by Mark Polizzotti) and New Impressions of Africa (2011, translated by Mark Ford) as well as Mark Ford\u2019s biography Raymond Roussel and the Republic of Dreams (2000) have continued Roussel\u2019s presence in English language writing.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"]}}
