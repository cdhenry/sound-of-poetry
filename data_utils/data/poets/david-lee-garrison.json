He earned his PhD from the Johns Hopkins University,\u00a0taught Spanish and Portuguese at Wright State University from 1979 to 2009, and is now retired.\u00a0He has published translations of Spanish poets from Lope de Vega to Gloria Fuertes, including collections of Nobel Laureate Vicente Aleixandre (with Willis Barnstone), Jos\u00e9 Bergam\u00edn, and Pedro Salinas.\u00a0\u00a0\nGarrison\u2019s poems have appeared widely in journals such as\u00a0Connecticut Review, Poem,\u00a0and\u00a0Rattle, and also in several anthologies.\u00a0Two poems from his book,\u00a0Sweeping the Cemetery, were read by Garrison Keillor on\u00a0The Writer\u2019s Almanac, and\u00a0one was included in Keillor\u2019s\u00a0Good Poems, American Places.\u00a0The title poem from his book,\u00a0Playing Bach in the D. C. Metro, was featured by Ted Kooser on his website,\u00a0American Life in Poetry.\n\r\nGarrison has stated about his work,\u00a0\u201cMy main goal is to communicate, so I create poems that are not hard to understand with a first reading.\u00a0\u00a0My poems emerge mainly from memories, as I fashion bits and pieces of my past into fictionalized configurations in a search for something more meaningful, more transcendent than my personal experience.\u201d\nCorey Andrews, in a review of\u00a0Sweeping the Cemetery\u00a0in\u00a0Ohioana Quarterly, states that Garrison\u2019s poetry \u201cexplores the nature of reflection and memory, probing the boundaries that separate the living and the dead.\u00a0The honorable tradition of poetic\u00a0memento mori\u00a0is directly addressed by Garrison, serving not only as the title of one of his poems but also as the collection\u2019s thematic core.\u201d\nDavid Lee Garrison lives in Dayton, Ohio, with his wife, Suzanne Kelly-Garrison, a writer and professor of law at Wright State University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
