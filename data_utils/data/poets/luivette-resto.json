In a 2008 blog interview with blogger Cindy E. Rodr\u00edguez, Resto discussed her commitment to the art, stating, \u201cI enjoy the challenge of finding the right set of words to express a series of thoughts, emotions, or observations in a compacted space. For me, poetry can be the most beautiful way to express some of the most painful yet truthful side to life.\u201d \u00a0 Resto is the author of the poetry collections Unfinished Portrait (2008), which was a finalist for the Paterson Poetry Prize, and Ascension (2013). A CantoMundo Fellow, she has taught at Citrus College and Mt. San Antonio College, and has served as a contributing editor for Kweli Journal.
