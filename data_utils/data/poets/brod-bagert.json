A former lawyer and New Orleans city councilman, he penned his first poem as a favor to his daughter, who needed a poem to recite in a school program. Bagert realized that few poems written in children\u2019s voices were available, so he wrote one himself. Since then, he has helped change children\u2019s poetry in America, focusing on performance as well as the poem itself. According to Timothy Rasinski, a literacy instructor at Kent State University, Bagert\u2019s poems allow children to \u201cstudy art\u201d through analysis of the poems, and then \u201ccreate art\u201d when they perform them. \u201cSince he is one of the few poets to (truly) write in the voice of a child, it\u2019s easy for (students) to use his material for expressiveness,\u201d Rasinski told the The Times-Picayune in a feature on Bagert. The article\u2019s author, Ramon Antonio Vargas, noted that part of Bagert\u2019s appeal to children was his ability to capture their swirling moods and emotions: \u201cBagert\u2019s verses often feature the private emotions\u2014raw, complex, humorous\u2014of youthful characters he created.\u201d Bagert\u2019s books of poetry for children include Systematic Me: Poems and Plays About The Human Body\u00a0(2019),\u00a0Weather or Climate?: Poems & Plays about Weather & Climate\u00a0(2019),\u00a0Shout! Little Poems that Roar (2007), Giant Children (2002), The Gooch Machine (1997), and Elephant Games and Other Playful Poems to Perform (1995). His collections for adults include Steel Cables (2008), Rainbows, Head Lice, and Pea-Green Tile: Poems in the Voice of the Classroom Teacher (1999), and A Bullfrog at Caf\u00e9 DuMonde (1986).\nAn active presence in schools nationwide, Bagert compares himself to Johnny Appleseed because he journeys across America, planting a love of poetry in children. He both performs poetry for children and instructs teachers in his Performance Method, which he describes as \u201ca system which recognizes that poetry is an oral art, and that, for children, a poem comes alive when they perform it.\u201d\u00a0Of his work\u2019s overall impact on children, Bagert noted, \u201cIt\u2019s an important moment when a child stands before an audience for the first time. There\u2019s a lot of self-esteem at stake. My children wanted poems they could act out and make everybody laugh. They wanted poems that would help them succeed.\u201d\n", "attrs": {}}
