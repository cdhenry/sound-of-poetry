The son of immigrant Russian Jews, he was born into the Jewish ghetto of the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1904. He is perhaps best-known for \u201cA\u201d,\u00a0a monumental poem in 24 parts, and for inventing the term \u201cobjectivists\u201d to describe himself and a loose-knit group of avant-garde poets. By\u00a0Zukofsky\u2019s definition, objectivist poets were distinguished by their focus on \u201csincerity\u201d and \u201cobjectification,\u201d or treating the poem as an object. \u00a0\nZukofsky was a New York Jewish poet, responsive to the cacophonous voice of the cosmopolitan city and\u00a0the Kaballistic emphasis on the magically transforming power of language. Determined to find a place for himself in the world beyond the ghetto, his route out was poetry. In his brief\u00a0Autobiography\u00a0he reported how he began to appropriate the heritage of Western literature, first in Yiddish and then in English: \u201cMy first exposure to letters at the age of four was thru the Yiddish theaters. \u2026 By the age of nine I had seen a good deal of Shakespeare, Ibsen, Strindberg and Tolstoy performed\u2014all in Yiddish. Even Longfellow\u2019s\u00a0Hiawatha\u00a0was to begin with read by me in Yiddish, as was Aeschylus\u2019\u00a0Prometheus Bound. \u2026 By eleven I was writing poetry in English, as yet not \u2018American English.\u2019\u201d\n\r\nAt age 16, Zukofsky entered Columbia University, where he wrote for and helped edit student literary magazines. He identified with the literary\u00a0avant garde\u00a0(as represented especially by\u00a0James Joyce,\u00a0Ezra Pound, and\u00a0T.S. Eliot) that saw itself as committed to a revolutionary assault upon a dead bourgeois culture. Zukofsky\u2019s first major poetic work, \u201cPoem Beginning \u2018The,\u2019\u201d\u00a0written in 1926 and published in\u00a0Exile\u00a0in 1928, demonstrates his commitment to a modernist poetic. \u201cThe poem\u2019s obvious predecessor,\u201d said Barry Ahearn in\u00a0Zukofsky\u2019s \u201cA\u201d: An Introduction,\u201d\u00a0is [Eliot\u2019s] \u2018The Waste Land.\u2019 In an attempt to surpass Eliot, Zukofsky pushes formal details to an excessive, but liberating, limit.\u201d\u00a0\u201cPoem Beginning \u2018The\u2019\u201d cultivates a tone of Eliot-like irony, as the poet tries to mediate between the insistently alien, Jewish particulars of his experience and an aspiration toward a broader American, \u201cEnglish,\u201d vaguely Christian culture.\nZukofsky soon abandoned Eliot for Ezra Pound, who was at once more approachable and more overpowering. Pound\u2019s warm response to\u00a0\u201cPoem Beginning \u2018The\u2019\u201d led to a flurry of letters between the two men, and Zukofsky eventually visited Pound at his home in Rapallo, Italy. Pound gave Zukofsky\u2019s poetic career an important boost by urging Poetry editor\u00a0Harriet Monroe\u00a0to appoint the young New Yorker as guest editor of a special issue devoted to new English and American poets.\n\r\nIt was in this\u00a0Poetry\u00a0issue that Zukofsky invented the name \u201cobjectivists\u201d to describe himself and the other poets\u2014including\u00a0Charles Reznikoff,\u00a0George Oppen,\u00a0Carl Rakosi, and\u00a0Basil Bunting\u2014whose work he liked. (Zukofsky, however, never used the term \u201cobjectivism\u201d and never claimed to be the leader of a movement named \u201cobjectivism.\u201d) Most of these objectivists also appeared in Zukofsky\u2019s\u00a0An \u201cObjectivists\u201d Anthology,\u00a0where they were joined by Pound and even Eliot. The core group of Zukofsky, Reznikoff, Bunting, Oppen, Rakosi, and\u00a0Lorine Niedecker\u00a0eventually cohered into something approaching a movement, with Zukofsky established as both the principal theorist and\u2014until World War II\u2014the most diligent critic of and advocate for the poetry of his friends.\n\r\nObjectivist verse owed a great deal to imagism. Indeed, in his preface to\u00a0An \u201cObjectivists\u201d Anthology\u00a0Zukofsky quoted Pound\u2019s 1912 Imagist credo: \u201cdirect treatment of the \u2018thing\u2019 whether subjective or objective.\u201d But in two respects objectivist poetry went beyond imagism. First, unlike such imagists as\u00a0Amy Lowell, most of the objectivists were unwilling to treat the poem simply as a transparent window through which one could perceive the objects of the world. Rather the objectivists wanted, as Zukofsky declared in his\u00a0Poetry\u00a0essay\u00a0\u201cSincerity and Objectification,\u201d\u00a0to see the \u201cpoem as object,\u201d calling attention to itself by, for example, deliberate syntactic fragmentation and by line breaks that disrupt normal speech rhythm. Second, following Pound\u2019s poetic practice of the 1920s, the objectivist poets were at least as much interested in historic particulars as they were in immediate sensory images. All the objectivists shared Pound\u2019s aspiration to create a \u201cpoem containing history\u201d; and Pound\u2019s use of historical documents in his\u00a0Cantos\u00a0showed these poets a way of bringing history into their poems without violating the principle of objectivity.\n\r\nAs the Western world slid into the economic and political crises of the 1930s, a concern with history more and more often translated into political engagement. During the 1930s Zukofsky regularly described himself as a communist. At times in the 1930s, Zukofsky\u2019s Leftism took the form of a vague, sentimental admiration for Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, but Zukofsky was also outspokenly critical of the crude dogmatism characteristic of certain Stalinists. During this period Zukofsky did become, however, a serious student of the writings of Karl Marx.\n\r\nThe short poems that Zukofsky wrote in the 1920s and 1930s, ultimately gathered in the opening two sections of\u00a0All,\u00a0bring together in various complex ways three currents: a Pound-like faith that truth can be achieved through a poetry which stays with the movement of \u201cthe particulars\u201d; a neo-formalist concern with the poem as a shaped object; and a Marxist concern with social oppression and class struggle. A case in point is\u00a0\u201cMantis\u201d and\u00a0\u201c\u2018Mantis,\u2019 an Interpretation,\u201d\u00a0written in 1934 and constituting a single two-part poem. The theme of\u00a0\u201cMantis\u201d\u00a0is overtly political: a praying mantis becomes a symbol of \u201cthe poor,\u201d lost and harried in a harshly mechanical world. Individually the \u201cseparate poor,\u201d like the solitary mantis, are powerless; but the work ends with a vision of the mantis drawing up the \u201carmies of the poor,\u201d which, inspired by this fragile bit of nature that has managed to survive in the stone subway, will \u201carise like leaves\u201d to \u201cbuild the new world.\u201d\n\r\nIn\u00a0\u201c\u2018Mantis,\u2019 an Interpretation,\u201d\u00a0which is written in free verse, Zukofsky annotates his own poem; describes his own compositional process (providing, for example, lines from early drafts); and deconstructs the very symbol that he has created within the poem. (\u201cThe Mantis,\u201d he says, \u201cmight have heaped up upon itself a / Grave of verse, / But the facts are not a symbol.\u201d) As his commentary demonstrates, Zukofsky isn\u2019t so much interested in the perfectly shaped created object, the \u201cwell-made poem,\u201d as he is in the\u00a0process\u00a0of objectification; and the full text of the mantis sequence demonstrates his conviction that poetry faithful to this process will justify both the particulars of the world (the mantis as fact rather than symbol) and a history in which the poor are struggling to become the masters of their own destiny.\n\r\nGenerally, the poems in\u00a0All\u00a0seek the condition of song, a distilled lyric quintessence. In\u00a0\u201cA,\u201d\u00a0Zukofsky allows himself a much looser method. Like Pound\u2019s\u00a0Cantos,\u00a0\u201cA\u201d\u00a0is a ragbag: in theory anything can go in, and the sheer heterogeneity of the materials is itself the point. Yet there are thematic continuities in\u00a0\u201cA,\u201d\u00a0and the opening ten sections return repeatedly to the social and political concerns of\u00a0\u201cMantis.\u201d\u00a0Beginning with an image of a young Jewish man (apparently Zukofsky) listening to a Carnegie Hall performance of\u00a0The Passion According to St. Matthew,\u00a0these opening sections of\u00a0\u201cA\u201d\u00a0revolve obsessively around the relationship between insider (economic, artistic, ethnic, religious) and outsider in American society\u2014the young poet at once finds himself identifying with German composer Johann Sebastian Bach\u2019s artistic purity and repelled by the capitalist world that has, among other things, built Carnegie Hall and paid the musicians.\n\r\nZukofsky composed the first seven sections of\u00a0\u201cA\u201d\u00a0between 1928 and 1930, and then abandoned the project for five years, returning to it in 1935 with the much longer\u00a0\u201cA\u201d-8, where paraphrases of Henry Adams and Marx interweave in an extended meditation on \u201cLabor as creator/Labor as creature.\u201d Here Zukofsky struggles to redefine art itself, still represented chiefly by Bach, as a form of labor in Marx\u2019s sense\u2014that is, as the creation of use value. The Marxist concerns of\u00a0\u201cA\u201d-8 return in the first half of\u00a0\u201cA\u201d-9, an intricately musical text made up largely of phrases from\u00a0Das Kapital.\u00a0And in\u00a0\u201cA\u201d-10 written in 1940, Zukofsky laments the Nazi violation of Europe and summons the people of the world to fight back.\n\r\nAfter\u00a0\u201cA\u201d-10, however, the social and political concerns that dominated Zukofsky\u2019s work in the 1930s retreat into the background. The years around 1940 mark a major rupture caused not only by the fading of the revolutionary hopes that had stirred Zukofsky and others during the 1930s but also by a recentering of Zukofsky\u2019s life around home and family. Zukofsky met Celia Thaew, a musician and composer, in 1933, and they married in 1939; their only child, Paul, became a concert violinist in his early teens. (Zukofsky\u2019s only novel,\u00a0Little,\u00a0is a\u00a0roman a clef\u00a0centered on Paul\u2019s musical career.)\n\r\nThe short poems that Zukofsky wrote in the 1940s often record the music of domestic life, as in the delicate\u00a0\u201cSong for the Year\u2019s End\u201d\u00a0collected in\u00a0All: \u201cDaughter of music / and her sweet son / awake / the starry sky and bird.\u201d But in the 1940s Zukofsky both suspended work on\u00a0\u201cA\u201d\u00a0and wrote considerably fewer short poems than he had written in the previous two decades. He also largely suspended the various entrepreneurial poetic activities to which he had devoted much of his energy through the 1930s. This partial withdrawal from poetry may have been dictated by the need to support his family. At least while Paul was a small child, the combined demands of job and family seem to have left Zukofsky with relatively little time for writing.\n\r\nIn 1950 Zukofsky returned to\u00a0\u201cA\u201d\u00a0with the brief, dense\u00a0\u201cA\u201d-11 and the expansive\u00a0\u201cA\u201d-12. As Ahearn explained in\u00a0Zukofsky\u2019s\u00a0\u201cA\u201d,\u00a0both these new sections \u201cuse the family Zukofsky as a foundation.\u201d\u00a0\u201cA\u201d-12 is built thematically, like the final section of Bach\u2019s\u00a0The Art of the Fugue,\u00a0on the letters B, A, C, and H. At both the beginning and end of the movement is a repeated sequence of words: Blest, Ardent, Celia, Happy. The sequence dances harmoniously, impelled by a love which is, for Zukofsky as for Dante, \u201cthe force that moves the sun and the other stars,\u201d and which\u00a0is\u00a0music\u2014the music of the spheres, of Bach, of Paul practicing his violin. The outside world disrupts this harmony from time to time: in the middle of\u00a0\u201cA\u201d-12 a young family friend is drafted and sent off to Korea, and Zukofsky incorporates his wistful letters into the poem. But the harmony here sounded can absorb into itself even such discords, for the poem breathes a confidence that the poet has found a place within a larger order.\n\r\nDespite the sense of confidence and control pervading \u201cA\u201d-12, this poem seems less a new beginning than the finale of the first part\u2014what might be called the neo-Poundian part\u2014of Zukofsky\u2019s career.\u00a0\u201cA\u201d-12 is still essentially a collage text, layering incidents from domestic life with passages paraphrased from such sources as Spinoza and Aristotle. Zukofsky\u2019s line in the first 12 sections of\u00a0\u201cA\u201d\u00a0is shorter than Pound\u2019s, but it is Poundian in its attempts \u201cto compose in the sequence of the musical phrase,\u201d as Pound declared in \u201cA Retrospect.\u201d Thus Zukofsky says, in an often quoted passage from\u00a0\u201cA\u201d-12: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you. / About my\u00a0poetics\u2014\u00a0/ music / speech / An integral / Lower limit speech / Upper limit music.\u201d\n\r\nBut after\u00a0\u201cA\u201d-12 the flexible Poundian line, ranging freely between speech and music, gives way to another kind of line, more artful, perhaps more brittle, certainly further from the cadences of everyday speech; and the musical pattern of organization also gives way to something new, heard in the opening of \u201cA\u201d-13 and continued through its 13-page first section: \u201cWhat do you want to know / What do you want to do, / In a trice me the gist us; / Don\u2019t believe things turn untrue / A sea becomes teacher; / When the son takes his wife / Follows his genius, / Found in search / Come out of mysteries.\u201d\n\r\nRoughly two decade separates\u00a0\u201cA\u201d-12 from\u00a0\u201cA\u201d-13\u2014which was written in 1960\u2014and during this period Zukofsky\u2019s poetic method underwent an enormous change. Hints of this new method appeared in some of the earlier short poems, where there the intricate, mannered patterns justified themselves as varieties of song\u2014distinctly modern, often jaggedly atonal songs, but songs nonetheless. However, in\u00a0\u201cA\u201d-13 and thereafter, Zukofsky began composing long poems organized not by music but by arbitrary, quasi-mathematical patterns. Zukofsky worked out the principles of this new poetics in a monumental prose work titled\u00a0Bottom: On Shakespeare,\u00a0written between 1947 and 1960 and published in 1963.\n\r\nIf Pound influenced the first half of Zukofsky\u2019s career,\u00a0Shakespeare\u00a0influenced the second half. To Zukofsky, everything Shakespeare wrote revealed that love is ineffable: The language used to describe it is always too little or too much. Seeing love is no problem, but in speaking of it, love and reason split apart, creating a tragic world. The distance between eye and tongue troubled Zukofsky, as it troubled Shakespeare. This distance in turn meant that a \u201ctrue\u201d language must constantly reinforce the idea that it is a more or less arbitrary construct, not an infallible vehicle for conveying certainties about the world. Shakespeare\u2019s language, Zukofsky proposed, enacts its own arbitrariness by constantly changing the terms of its engagement with the world. But poetic language, at least since\u00a0William Wordsworth, has sought to validate itself by its claim to embody the felt truth of experience. When this claim becomes untenable, what happens to poetry? This is the question that Zukofsky\u2019s later poetry systematically explores.\n\r\nThe new direction in which Zukofsky\u2019s poetry moved during the 1950s is perhaps most clearly evident in his English adaptation of all the poetry of\u00a0Catullus. Zukofsky\u2019s versions of Catullus are best described as transliterations rather than as translations, for they seek to reproduce the sound as well as the sense of Catullus\u2019s Latin. Or more accurately, it might be said that they reproduce the sound first and the sense only secondarily. He had given himself an insurmountable task. As Davenport noted, \u201cTo translate all of Catullus so that the English sounds like the Latin Zukofsky had to pay attention to three things at once: sound, rhythm, and syntax. The choice of each word therefore involved three decisions. This is of course impossible.\u201d\n\r\nIn the later sections of\u00a0\u201cA\u201d\u00a0Zukofsky also explored language. For example,\u00a0\u201cA\u201d-14, 44 pages long, is composed entirely of three-line stanzas. In the first 16 pages almost every line consists of two words; then it shifts to a three-word line, with occasional passages in one-word lines. The poet allows himself dashes, question marks, and quotation marks, but only an occasional period or comma. The resulting sense of syntactic indeterminacy was described as follows by Bruce Comens in a 1986\u00a0Sagetrieb\u00a0article: \u201cRather than excluding meaning, Zukofsky\u2019s increasing suppression of context \u2026\u00a0expands\u00a0meaning. \u2026 [His] method results in a multiplicity of meanings having no central \u2018point,\u2019 so that, while the poem itself is remarkably assured, the reader is likely to feel considerable insecurity among the rapidly shifting perspectives available in reading any given line. Becoming more or less constantly ironic, the text achieves that \u2026 skepticism which [in Zukofsky\u2019s words] \u2018doubts its own skepticism and becomes the only kind of skepticism true to itself.\u2019\u201d\n\r\nThe remarkable opacity of Zukofsky\u2019s later poetry offended many critics and even some his former friends\u2014for example, Zukofsky quarrelled bitterly with George Oppen, his objectivist comrade from the 1930s, after Oppen accused Zukofsky of using obscurity as a tactic. But the 1960s and 1970s also brought Zukofsky a degree of public recognition that he had never before received. By the late 1960s, critics were also beginning to acknowledge the importance of Zukofsky\u2019s work. In particular, the influential scholar Hugh Kenner became a close friend of Zukofsky and an advocate of his work. More important still, the later years brought Zukofsky the warm admiration of many younger poets. Such major poets as\u00a0Robert Duncan\u00a0and\u00a0Robert Creeley\u00a0have testified to Zukofsky\u2019s importance as an example of dedication to the poetic craft and as the creator of daring experimental writing. As Creeley declared in his\u00a0Paideuma\u00a0tribute to Zukofsky: \u201cFor myself and others of my generation, our elders in the art were extraordinary example and resource. Despite a chaos of restrictive generalization, we had nonetheless the active, persistent functioning of example: Ezra Pound,\u00a0William Carlos Williams, Basil Bunting, Louis Zukofsky\u2014to note those most dear to my own heart.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Objectivist"]}}
