Numerous critics have praised Neruda as the greatest poet writing in the Spanish language during his lifetime. John Leonard in the\u00a0New York Times declared that Neruda \u201cwas, I think, one of the great ones, a Whitman of the South.\u201d Among contemporary readers in the United States, he is largely remembered for his odes and love poems.\n\r\nBorn Ricardo Eliezer Neftali Reyes y Basoalto, Neruda adopted the pseudonym under which he would become famous while still in his early teens. He grew up in Temuco in the backwoods of southern Chile. Neruda\u2019s literary development received assistance from unexpected sources. Among his teachers \u201cwas the poet Gabriela Mistral\u00a0who would be a Nobel laureate years before Neruda,\u201d reported Manuel Duran and Margery Safir in\u00a0Earth Tones: The Poetry of Pablo Neruda. \u201cIt is almost inconceivable that two such gifted poets should find each other in such an unlikely spot. Mistral recognized the young Neftali\u2019s talent and encouraged it by giving the boy books and the support he lacked at home.\u201d\n\r\nBy the time he finished high school, Neruda had published in local papers and Santiago magazines, and had won several literary competitions. In 1921 he left southern Chile for Santiago to attend school, with the intention of becoming a French teacher but was an indifferent student. While in Santiago, Neruda completed one of his most critically acclaimed and original works, the cycle of love poems titled\u00a0Veinte poemas de amor y una canci\u00f3n desesperada\u2014published in English translation as\u00a0Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair.\u00a0This work quickly marked Neruda as an important Chilean poet.\n\nVeinte poemas\u00a0also brought the author notoriety due to its explicit celebration of sexuality, and, as Robert Clemens remarked in the\u00a0Saturday Review, \u201cestablished him at the outset as a frank, sensuous spokesman for love.\u201d While other Latin American poets of the time used sexually explicit imagery, Neruda was the first to win popular acceptance for his presentation. Mixing memories of his love affairs with memories of the wilderness of southern Chile, he creates a poetic sequence that not only describes a physical liaison, but also evokes the sense of displacement that Neruda felt in leaving the wilderness for the city. \u201cTraditionally,\u201d stated Rene de Costa in\u00a0The Poetry of Pablo Neruda, \u201clove poetry has equated woman with nature. Neruda took this established mode of comparison and raised it to a cosmic level, making woman into a veritable force of the universe.\u201d\n\r\n\u201cIn\u00a0Veinte poemas,\u201d wrote David P. Gallagher in\u00a0Modern Latin American Literature, \u201cNeruda journeys across the sea symbolically in search of an ideal port. In 1927, he embarked on a real journey, when he sailed from Buenos Aires for Lisbon, ultimately bound for Rangoon where he had been appointed honorary Chilean consul.\u201d Duran and Safir explained that \u201cChile had a long tradition, like most Latin American countries, of sending her poets abroad as consuls or even, when they became famous, as ambassadors.\u201d The poet was not really qualified for such a post and was unprepared for the squalor, poverty, and loneliness to which the position would expose him. \u201cNeruda travelled extensively in the Far East over the next few years,\u201d Gallagher continued, \u201cand it was during this period that he wrote his first really splendid book of poems,\u00a0Residencia en la tierra,\u00a0a book ultimately published in two parts, in 1933 and 1935.\u201d Neruda added a third part,\u00a0Tercera residencia,\u00a0in 1947.\n\nResidencia en la tierra,\u00a0published in English as\u00a0Residence on Earth,\u00a0is widely celebrated as containing \u201csome of Neruda\u2019s most extraordinary and powerful poetry,\u201d according to de Costa. Born of the poet\u2019s feelings of alienation, the work reflects a world which is largely chaotic and senseless, and which\u2014in the first two volumes\u2014offers no hope of understanding. De Costa quoted Spanish poet Garc\u00eda Lorca as calling Neruda \u201ca poet closer to death than to philosophy, closer to pain than to insight, closer to blood than to ink. A poet filled with mysterious voices that fortunately he himself does not know how to decipher.\u201d With its emphasis on despair and the lack of adequate answers to mankind\u2019s problems,\u00a0Residencia en la tierra\u00a0in some ways foreshadowed the post-World War II philosophy of existentialism. \u201cNeruda himself came to regard it very harshly,\u201d wrote Michael Wood in the\u00a0New York Review of Books. \u201cIt helped people to die rather than to live, he said, and if he had the proper authority to do so he would ban it, and make sure it was never reprinted.\u201d\n\nResidencia en la tierra\u00a0also marked Neruda\u2019s emergence as an important international poet. By the time the second volume of the collection was published in 1935 the poet was serving as consul in Spain, where \u201cfor the first time,\u201d reported Duran and Safir, \u201che tasted international recognition, at the heart of the Spanish language and tradition. At the same time \u2026 poets like Rafael Alberti and Miguel Hernandez, who had become closely involved in radical politics and the Communist movement, helped politicize Neruda.\u201d When the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, Neruda was among the first to espouse the Republican cause with the poem\u00a0Espa\u00f1a en el corazon\u2014a gesture that cost him his consular post. He later served in France and Mexico, where his politics caused less anxiety.\n\r\nSome readers have found it difficult to disassociate Neruda\u2019s poetry from his fervent commitment to communism. An added difficulty lies in the fact that Neruda\u2019s poetry is very hard to translate; his works available in English represent only a small portion of his total output. Nonetheless,Communism rescued Neruda from the despair he expressed in the first parts of\u00a0Residencia en la tierra,\u00a0and led to a change in his approach to poetry. He came to believe \u201cthat the work of art and the statement of thought\u2014when these are responsible human actions, rooted in human need\u2014are inseparable from historical and political context,\u201d reported Salvatore Bizzarro in\u00a0Pablo Neruda: All Poets the Poet. \u201cHe argued that there are books which are important at a certain moment in history, but once these books have resolved the problems they deal with they carry in them their own oblivion. Neruda felt that the belief that one could write solely for eternity was romantic posturing.\u201d This new attitude led the poet in new directions; for many years his work, both poetry and prose, advocated an active role in social change rather than simply describing his feelings, as his earlier oeuvre had done.\n\r\nThis significant shift in Neruda\u2019s poetry is recognizable in\u00a0Tercera residencia, the third and final part of the \u201cResidencia\u201d series. Florence L. Yudin noted in\u00a0Hispania\u00a0that the poetry of this volume was overlooked when published and remains neglected due to its overt ideological content. \u201cViewed as a whole,\u201d Yudin wrote, \u201cTercera residencia\u00a0illustrates a fluid coherence of innovation with retrospective, creativity with continuity, that would characterize Neruda\u2019s entire career.\u201d According to de Costa, as quoted by Yudin, \u201cThe new posture assumed is that of a radical nonconformist.\u00a0Terra residencia\u00a0must, therefore, be considered in this light, from the dual perspective of art and society, poetry and politics.\u201d\n\r\n\u201cLas Furias y las penas,\u201d the longest poem of\u00a0Tercera residencia,\u00a0embodies the influence of both the Spanish Civil War and the works of Spanish Baroque poet Francisco Gomez de Quevedo y Villegas on Neruda. The poem explores the psychic agony of lost love and its accompanying guilt and suffering, conjured in the imagery of savage eroticism, alienation, and loss of self-identity. Neruda\u2019s message, according to Yudin, is that \u201cwhat makes up life\u2019s narrative (\u2018cuento\u2019) are single, unconnected events, governed by chance, and meaningless (\u2018suceden\u2019). Man is out of control, like someone hallucinating one-night stands in sordid places.\u201d Yudin concluded that, \u201cDespite its failed dialectic, \u2018Las Furias y las penas\u2019 sustains a haunting beauty in meaning and tone\u201d and \u201cbears the unmistakable signature of Neruda\u2019s originality and achievement.\u201d\n\r\nNeruda\u2019s politics had an important impact on his poetry.\u00a0Clayton Eshleman\u00a0wrote in the introduction to Cesar Vallejo\u2019s\u00a0Poemas humanos/ Human Poems\u00a0that \u201cNeruda found in the third book of\u00a0Residencia the key to becoming\u00a0the\u00a020th-century South American poet: the revolutionary stance which always changes with the tides of time.\u201d Gordon Brotherton, in\u00a0Latin American Poetry: Origins and Presence,\u00a0expanded on this idea by noting that \u201cNeruda, so prolific, can be lax, a \u2018great bad poet\u2019 (to use the phrase Juan Ramon Jimenez used to revenge himself on Neruda). And his change of stance \u2018with the tides of time\u2019 may not always be perfectly effected. But \u2026 his dramatic and rhetorical skills, better his ability to speak out of his circumstances, \u2026 was consummate. In his best poetry (of which there is much) he speaks on a scale and with an agility unrivaled in Latin America.\u201d\n\r\nNeruda expanded on his political views in the poem\u00a0Canto general,\u00a0which, according to de Costa, is a \u201clengthy epic on man\u2019s struggle for justice in the New World.\u201d Although Neruda had begun the poem as early as 1935\u2014when he had intended it to be limited in scope only to Chile\u2014he completed some of the work while serving in the Chilean senate as a representative of the Communist Party. However, party leaders recognized that the poet needed time to work on his opus, and granted him a leave of absence in 1947. Later that year, however, Neruda returned to political activism, writing letters in support of striking workers and criticizing Chilean President Videla. Early in 1948 the Chilean Supreme Court issued an order for his arrest, and Neruda finished the\u00a0Canto general\u00a0while hiding from Videla\u2019s forces.\n\r\n\u201cCanto general\u00a0is the flowering of Neruda\u2019s new political stance,\u201d\u00a0Don Bogen asserted in the\u00a0Nation. \u201cFor Neruda food and other pleasures are our birthright\u2014not as gifts from the earth or heaven but as the products of human labor.\u201d According to Bogen,\u00a0Canto general\u00a0draws its \u201cstrength from a commitment to nameless workers\u2014the men of the salt mines, the builders of Macchu Picchu\u2014and the fundamental value of their labor.\u201d Commenting on\u00a0Canto general\u00a0in\u00a0Books Abroad,\u00a0Jaime Alazraki remarked, \u201cNeruda is not merely chronicling historical events. The poet is always present throughout the book not only because he describes those events, interpreting them according to a definite outlook on history, but also because the epic of the continent intertwines with his own epic.\u201d\n\r\nAlthough, as Bizzarro noted, \u201cIn [the\u00a0Canto general], Neruda was to reflect some of the [Communist] party\u2019s basic ideological tenets,\u201d the work itself is far more than propaganda. Looking back into American prehistory, the poet examined the land\u2019s rich natural heritage and described the long defeat of the native Americans by the Europeans. He concentrated on elements of people\u2019s lives common to all people at all times.\u00a0Nancy Willard\u00a0wrote in\u00a0Testimony of the Invisible Man, \u201cNeruda makes it clear that our most intense experience of impermanence is not death but our own isolation among the living. \u2026 If Neruda is intolerant of despair, it is because he wants nothing to sully man\u2019s residence on earth.\u201d\n\r\n\u201cIn the\u00a0Canto,\u201d explained Duran and Safir, \u201cNeruda reached his peak as a public poet. He produced an ideological work that largely transcended contemporary events and became an epic of an entire continent and its people.\u201d According to Alazraki, \u201cBy bringing together his own odyssey and the drama of the continent, Neruda has simultaneously given to\u00a0Canto general\u00a0the quality of a lyric and an epic poem. The lives of conquistadors, martyrs, heroes, and just plain people recover a refreshing actuality because they become part of the poet\u2019s fate, and conversely, the life of the poet gains new depth because in his search one recognizes the continent\u2019s struggles.\u00a0Canto general\u00a0is, thus, the song of a continent as much as it is Neruda\u2019s own song.\u201d\n\r\nNeruda returned to Chile from exile in 1953, and, said Duran and Safir, spent the last 20 years of his life producing \u201csome of the finest love poetry in\u00a0One Hundred Love Sonnets\u00a0and parts of\u00a0Extravagaria\u00a0and\u00a0La Barcarola;\u00a0he produced Nature poetry that continued the movement toward close examination, almost still shots of every aspect of the external world, in the odes of\u00a0Navegaciones y regresos,\u00a0in\u00a0The Stones of Chile,\u00a0in\u00a0The Art of Birds,\u00a0in\u00a0Una Casa en la arena\u00a0and in\u00a0Stones of the Sky.\u00a0He continued as well his role as public poet in\u00a0Canci\u00f3n de geste,\u00a0in parts of\u00a0Cantos ceremoniales,\u00a0in the mythical\u00a0La Espada encendida,\u00a0and the angry\u00a0Incitement to Nixonicide and Praise for the Chilean Revolution.\u201d\n\r\nAt this time, Neruda\u2019s work began to move away from the highly political stance it had taken during the 1930s. Neruda began to try to speak to everyday people simply and clearly, on a level that anyone could understand. He wrote poems on subjects ranging from rain to feet. By examining common, ordinary, everyday things very closely, according to Duran and Safir, Neruda gives us \u201ctime to examine a particular plant, a stone, a flower, a bird, an aspect of modern life, at leisure. We look at the object, handle it, turn it around, all the sides are examined with love, care, attention. This is, in many ways, Neruda \u2026 at his best.\u201d\n\r\nIn 1971 Neruda reached the peak of his political career when the Chilean Communist party nominated him for president. He withdrew his nomination, however, when he reached an accord with Socialist nominee Salvador Allende. After Allende won the election he reactivated Neruda\u2019s diplomatic credentials, appointing the poet ambassador to France. It was while Neruda was serving in Paris that he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature, in recognition of his oeuvre. Poor health soon forced the poet to resign his post, however, and he returned to Chile, where he died in 1973\u2014only days after a right-wing military coup killed Allende and seized power. Many of his last poems, some published posthumously, indicate his awareness of his death\u2019s approach. As Fernando Alegria wrote in\u00a0Modern Poetry Studies, \u201cWhat I want to emphasize is something very simple: Neruda was, above all, a love poet and, more than anyone, an unwavering, powerful, joyous, conqueror of death.\u201d\n\r\nCommenting on\u00a0Passions and Impressions,\u00a0a posthumous collection of Neruda\u2019s prose poems, political and literary essays, lectures, and newspaper articles, Mark Abley wrote in\u00a0Maclean\u2019s, \u201cNo matter what occasion provoked these pieces, his rich, tireless voice echoes with inimitable force.\u201d As Neruda eschewed literary criticism, many critics found in him a lack of rationalism. According to Neruda, \u201cIt was through metaphor, not rational analysis and argument, that the mysteries of the world could be revealed,\u201d remarked\u00a0Stephen Dobyns\u00a0in the\u00a0Washington Post.\u00a0However, Dobyns noted that\u00a0Passions and Impressions \u201cshows Neruda both at his most metaphorical and his most rational. \u2026 What one comes to realize from these prose pieces is how conscious and astute were Neruda\u2019s esthetic choices. In retrospect at least his rejection of the path of the maestro, the critic, the rationalist was carefully calculated.\u201d In his speech upon receiving the Nobel Prize, Neruda noted that \u201cthere arises an insight which the poet must learn through other people. There is no insurmountable solitude. All paths lead to the same goal: to convey to others what we are.\u201d\n\r\nIn 2003, 30 years after Neruda\u2019s death, an anthology of 600 of Neruda\u2019s poems arranged chronologically was published as\u00a0The Poetry of Pablo Neruda. The collection draws from 36 different translators, and some of his major works are also presented in their original Spanish. Writing in the\u00a0New Leader,\u00a0Phoebe Pettingell pointed out that, although some works were left out because of the difficulty in presenting them properly in English, \u201can overwhelming body of Neruda\u2019s output is here \u2026 and the collection certainly presents a remarkable array of subjects and styles.\u201d Reflecting on the life and work of Neruda in the\u00a0New Yorker,\u00a0Mark Strand\u00a0commented, \u201cThere is something about Neruda\u2014about the way he glorifies experience, about the spontaneity and directness of his passion\u2014that sets him apart from other poets. It is hard not to be swept away by the urgency of his language, and that\u2019s especially so when he seems swept away.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Latin America"]}}
