A distinctive voice in American poetry, Duncan\u2019s idiosyncratic poetics drew on myth, occultism, religion\u2014including the theosophical tradition in which he was raised\u2014and innovative writing practices such as projective verse and composition by field. During his lifetime, critics such as M.L. Rosenthal heralded him as \u201cthe most intellectual of our poets from the point of view of the effect upon him of a wide, critically intelligent reading.\u201d Duncan\u2019s work drew on a wide range of references, including Homer, Dante, and the work of modernist poets such as H.D. His many books of poetry include Heavenly City Earthly City (1947), The Opening of the Field (1960), Roots and Branches (1964), A Book of Resemblances (1966), Bending the Bow (1968), and, after a 15-year publishing hiatus, the influential volumes Ground Work I: Before the War (1984) and Ground Work II: In the Dark (1987). His Selected Poems (1993) was published posthumously, as was his volume of collected writings, and personal tribute to the work of H.D., The H.D. Book (2011). A decades-long project that distills much of Duncan\u2019s thinking on poetry, modernism, and the role of the occult in the imagination, The Nation\u2019s critic Ange Mlinko described The H.D. Book as a \u201cpalimpsest.\u201d Mlinko noted the importance of book for being \u201cnot only revisited and restarted many times over the years, but incorporating different sources from different points in time\u2026 Duncan\u2019s roving eye for patterns consistently saw relationships between the new science of his day and the ancient wisdom of the poets.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nDuncan was a syncretist possessing \u201ca bridge-building, time-binding, and space-binding imagination\u201d wrote Stephen Stepanchev in American Poetry since 1945. A typical Duncan poem, accordingly, is like a collage, \u201ca compositional field where anything might enter: a prose quotation, a catalogue, a recipe, a dramatic monologue, a diatribe,\u201d Davidson explained. The poems draw sources and materials together into one dense fabric. Writing in the New York Times Book Review, Jim Harrison called the structure of a typical Duncan poem multi-layered and four-dimensional (\u201cmoving through time with the poet\u201d), and compared it to \u201ca block of weaving\u2026 Bending the Bow is for the strenuous, the hyperactive reader of poetry; to read Duncan with any immediate grace would require Norman O. Brown's knowledge of the arcane mixed with Ezra Pound's grasp of poetics\u2026 [Duncan] is personal rather than confessional and writes within a continuity of tradition.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nDuncan was born in 1919 in Oakland, California. His childhood experiences shape and inform his later poetics. Adopted at an early age by a couple who selected him on the basis of his astrological configuration, his adopted parents\u2019 chosen religion, theosophy, and reverence for the occult was a lasting influence on his poetic vision. Encouraged by a high school English teacher who saw poetry as an essential means of sustaining spiritual vigor, Duncan chose his vocation while still in his teens. He studied at the University of California-Berkeley for two years before leaving California to briefly attend Black Mountain College. Duncan also lived in New York for a period, and made the acquaintance of literary figures like Arthur Miller and\u00a0Ana\u00efs Nin. Duncan was drafted in 1941, but discharged after coming out as gay. One of the first literary figures to openly acknowledge his sexuality, Duncan\u2019s article \u201cThe Homosexual in Society\u201d appeared in the influential journal Politics in 1944. Duncan returned to San Francisco in 1945, where he met Rexroth, Spicer, Blaser and others. He studied Medieval and Renaissance literature at Berkeley. During the 1950s and \u201860s, Duncan was, according to Paul Christensen \u201cat the center of the San Francisco renaissance; his connections to Olson and Black Mountain College, where he taught in 1956, put him at the center of the Black Mountain movement as well.\u201d In 1951 Duncan met Jess Collins, a painter and collagist. The two remained lovers for the rest of Duncan\u2019s life.\n\r\nMany of Duncan\u2019s best-known poems were shaped by ideas associated with Olson and the Black Mountain School of poetry. Both \u201cprojective verse,\u201d poetry shaped by the rhythms of the poet's breath, and \u201ccomposition by field,\u201d in which the page becomes a field of language activity beyond its traditional use of margins and spacing, influenced Duncan\u2019s poetry from The Opening of the Field (1960) onward. Generally, Duncan advocated a poetry of process, not conclusion. In some pages from a notebook published in Donald Allen's The New American Poetry: 1945-1960, Duncan stated: \u201cA longing grows to return to the open composition in which the accidents and imperfections of speech might awake intimations of human being\u2026 There is a natural mystery in poetry. We do not understand all that we render up to understanding\u2026 I study what I write as I study out any mystery. A poem, mine or another's, is an occult document, a body awaiting vivisection, analysis, X-rays.\u201d The poet, he explained, is an explorer more than a creator. \u201cI work at language as a spring of water works at the rock, to find a course, and so, blindly. In this I am not a maker of things, but, if maker, a maker of a way. For the way is itself.\u201d As in the art of marquetry (the making of patterns by enhancing natural wood grains), the poet is aware of the possible meanings of words and merely brings them out. \u201cI'm not putting a grain into the wood,\u201d he told Jack R. Cohn and Thomas J. O'Donnell in a Contemporary Literature interview. Later, he added, \u201cI acquire language lore. What I am supplying is something like\u2026 grammar of design, or of the possibilities of design.\u201d The goal of composition, he wrote in a Caterpillar essay, was \u201cnot to reach conclusion but to keep our exposure to what we do not know.\u201d\n\r\nKnown for his anarchic political views, Duncan\u2019s work frequently took on political dimensions as well. Books like Bending the Bow and Groundwork I: After the War attempt to trace the difference between organic and imposed order, and the necessity and scope of an individual\u2019s political commitment. In his introduction to Ground Work (2006), the combined edition of After the War and In the Dark, poet Michael Palmer noted of the connections between Duncan\u2019s politics and his poetics: \u201cWar will follow war, within and without. Any opposition to the immediate war must acknowledge its various meanings, the forms of contention that for Duncan are also the source of poesis, poetic making and meaning. The poet is everywhere implicated in such human and metaphysical circumstances. He or she cannot stand apart or above. The poem itself cannot preach without betraying its nature; it must enact.\u201d Duncan\u2019s political views on the Vietnam War cost him his friendship with the poet Denise Levertov. Their correspondence is collected in The Letters of Robert Duncan and Denise Levertov (2003).\r\n\u00a0\r\nRobert Duncan died in San Francisco in 1988 after a long battle with kidney disease. His papers are housed at the State University of New York-Buffalo. Even after his death, Duncan has continued to exert a powerful and profound influence on the shape of American poetry. The publication of The H.D. Book in particular was heralded as a milestone in both Duncan scholarship and the history of modernism. As Christensen noted, \u201cHis work embodies the restless spirit of midcentury, with its exploration of sexuality and religion and its need to investigate the hidden corners of the psyche.\u201d \n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"], "School/Period:": ["Black Mountain"]}}
