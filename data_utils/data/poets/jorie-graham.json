She has taught for many years at Harvard University as the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory, the first woman to be given this position, which was previously held by Seamus Heaney and many other writers dating back to the first Boylston Professor, John Quincy Adams.\nBorn in New York City, Graham was raised and educated in Italy and France. She attended the Sorbonne in Paris, where she studied philosophy, and New York University, where she pursued filmmaking. While in New York, she began writing and studying poetry, and went on to earn an MFA from the Iowa Writer\u2019s Workshop. She later taught at the Writers\u2019 Workshop, leaving to join the faculty at Harvard. When her collection Place won the Forward Poetry Prize in 2012, she was the first American woman to receive the UK award. When she was awarded the\u00a0International Nonino Literary Prize in 2013, she was only the third US recipient since the award was established. In 2017 she was awarded the Wallace Stevens Award from the Academy of American Poets.\r\n\u00a0\r\nGraham is known for her deep interest in history, language, and perception; the critic Calvin Bedient has noted that she is, \u201cnever less than in dialogue with everything. She is the world champion at shot-putting the great questions. It hardly matters what the title is: the subject itself is always \u2018the outermost question being asked me by the World today.\u2019 What counts is the hope in the questioning itself, not the answers.\u201d Graham has received numerous honors and awards for her work, including the prestigious MacArthur fellowship and the Morton Dauwen Zabel Award from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.\n\r\nVisual art, mythology, history, and philosophy are central to Graham\u2019s work. The influences of her mother, a sculptor, and father, a journalist, her trilingual upbringing, and her early immersion in European culture are all evident in her poetry. Her influences are predominantly modernists\u2014William Butler Yeats, T.S. Eliot, and Wallace Stevens, among others\u2014and help explain the shape and flow of her poetry, which is marked by a reliance on line as a unit of sense and perception. Using long and short lines, indentation and spacing, Graham\u2019s forms explore the dualities and polarities of life, of the creative and destructive tensions that exist between spirit and flesh, the real and the mythical, stillness and motion, the interior and exterior existence. While Graham\u2019s first two books received high praise, her third, The End of Beauty, is generally acknowledged as a watershed. In this book, Graham fully developed her long, flexible line and focused definitively on consequence rather than closure. Critic Sven Birkerts noted that in the poems, Graham \u201cdiscovers in her narrative the critical or pivotal moment: she then slows the action to expose its perilous eventual consequences.\u201d Several of the poems are broken into numbered sections, often of seemingly unrelated fragments that are pieces of a larger collage; at times, the poet offers a kind of \u201cclose\u201d reading which requires readers both to participate in the poem by filling in the blank and for Graham to present her own inability to express the not-yet-conceivable, as in \u201cLike a ___________ this look between us.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nThrough her collections of poetry, Graham\u2019s distinctive style has evolved to accommodate both new kinds of experience and new kinds of reading. In the Paris Review, Graham noted of her shift from the long sentence-like lines of The End of Beauty to the shorter lyrical line of Region of Unlikeness: \u201cI wanted to pack a lot into the lyric, but not go beyond its bounds. Some have written that I wanted to expand what the lyric could do. I just want the hugeness of experience\u2014which includes philosophical discursiveness\u2014to move at a rate of speed that kept it (because all within one unity of experience) emotional. Also, often, questions became the way the poems propelled themselves forward\u2026 It brings the reader in as a listener to a confession. ... A poem is a private story, after all, no matter how apparently public. The reader is always overhearing a confession.\u201d Graham\u2019s interest in the reader\u2019s experience of her work, and the power of poetry to reshape perceptions of the world, runs through all her books. According to Weston Cutter in the Kenyon Review, Graham is \u201cwriting ultimately for connection, and not just the abstract, we\u2019re-all-human connection, but a specific one between writer and reader\u2014there\u2019s a contract she\u2019s looking to enact. If you like Graham, the feeling of her poetry is seismic for the ways in which she tries so hard to get you to feel and understand, in all complexity, the issues she\u2019s tackling (without getting too bogged in this stuff: each of the books can, in ways, be understood as focusing specifically on central issues\u2014art, masculinity and femininity, history).\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nCritic David Baker once wrote that he could \u201cthink of no other current American poet who has employed and exposed the actual mechanics of narrative, of form, of strategic inquiry more fully than she has\u2014at least no other readable poet\u2014and no other poet able to deploy so fruitfully and invitingly the diverse systems of philosophy, science, and history. If anyone can unify the disjoined fields of contemporary discourse, I think it might be Jorie Graham.\u201d Graham herself has a different understanding of the potential of her work, and poetry generally. \u201cI\u2019d say poetry wants to be contagious, to be a contagion,\u201d she told the Paris Review. \u201cIts syntax wants to pass something on to an other in the way that you can, for example, pass laughter on. It\u2019s different from being persuasive and making an argument. That\u2019s why great poems have so few arguments in them. They don\u2019t want to make the reader \u2018agree.\u2019 They don\u2019t want to move through the head that way. They want to go from body to body. Built in is the belief that such community\u2014could one even say ceremony\u2014might \u2018save\u2019 the world.\u201d\n", "attrs": {}}
