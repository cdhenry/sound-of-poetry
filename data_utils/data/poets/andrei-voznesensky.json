He was one of a small group of poets to achieve great prominence in the Soviet Union during the cultural \"Khruschev Thaw.\" Voznesensky, along with\u00a0Yevgeny Yevtushenko,\u00a0Bella Akhmadulina, and others, frequently gave multi-hour readings and performances to sports stadiums full of listeners.  Despite writing to and befriending Boris Pasternak at age 14, Voznesensky studied architecture and engineering until witnessing a fire at the Institute of Architecture in Moscow. He would later say of the fire, \u201c\u201cI believe in symbols. I understood that architecture was burned out in\u00a0me. I became a poet.\u201d Voznesenky managed a complicated relationship with the Soviet government, offering frequent rebukes and mostly avoiding harsh repercussions. Writing in the New York Times, Raymond H. Anderson said \u201cMr. Voznesensky\u2019s poetry epitomized the setbacks, gains and hopes of the post-Stalin decades in Russia. His hundreds of subtle, ironic and innovative verses reflected alternating periods of calm and stress as the Communist Party\u2019s rule stabilized, weakened and then, in 1991, quickly disintegrated.\u201d \u00a0 In addition to widespread popularity in Russia, including having several poems turned into award winning pop songs, Voznesensky\u2019s work was also widely read in the United States. A selection of his writing, translated by W.H. Auden, Stanley Kunitz, Richard Wilbur, William Jay Smith, amongst others, appeared in 1966 and he toured the country frequently, pairing often with Allen Ginsberg. In an introduction to an interview in 1980, the Paris Review said \u201cHis name shows up in literary journals while his face appears in fashion magazines. He is a legend in Russia; he is recognized in small airports in the American South.\u201d He died in Moscow in 2010.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Russia"]}}
