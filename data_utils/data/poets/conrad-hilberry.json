He earned a BA from Oberlin College and an MA and PhD from the University of Wisconsin, Madison; he was a professor of English at Kalamazoo College in Michigan from 1962 to 1998. Hilberry\u2019s poetry collections include Encounter on Burrows Hill and Other Poems (1968), Rust (1974), Man in the Attic (1980), Knowing Rivers, You Know the Shape and Bias (1980), The Moon Seen as a Slice of Pineapple (1984), Jacob\u2019s Dancing Tune (1986), Sorting the Smoke: New and Selected Poems (1990), winner of the Iowa Prize, Player Piano: Poems (2000),\u00a0The Fingernail of Luck (2005), and Until the Full Moon Has Its Say (2014). He also co-authored This Awkward Art: Poems by a Father and Daughter (2009) with the poet Jane Hilberry, his daughter.\r\n\u00a0\r\nA master of both free verse and received forms, Hilberry infused the familiar and everyday in his poetry with intellectual insight. Poet Henry Taylor said that Hilberry\u2019s poems possess \u201cthe spooky ability to make odd, though rarely surreal, connections. The poems move with quiet authority from the observation of a particular, and of the possibilities surrounding it, to exploration of what might happen next. The miracle is that they do this without arbitrariness.\u201d In the introduction to Hilberry\u2019s collaboration with his daughter, This Awkward Art, poet Richard Wilbur noted that \u201cone sees from different vantages the constellation of a family.\u201d The two poets contemplate local, familial scenes and the death of their daughter/sister, each writing their own response to shared subjects.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHilberry is also the author of the nonfiction Luke Karamazov (1987), an account of serial murderers in Kalamazoo. He co-edited three volumes of \u201cThird Coast\u201d poetry from Michigan, including New Poems from the Third Coast: Contemporary Michigan Poetry (2000).\r\n\u00a0\r\nHilberry\u2019s awards include a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in poetry and a Michigan Arts Award. He died in early 2017.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
