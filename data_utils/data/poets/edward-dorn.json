He once wrote he was \u201cbrought up off and on during / the intensity of depression nomadism,\u201d and his hardscrabble early existence informed his poetics. According to Tom Clark, Dorn\u2019s biographer, Dorn \u201cfollowed the wandering work-searches of his several \u2018exodus relatives\u2019 down \u2018bleak grit avenues\u2019 of a childhood whose anxious, difficult instruction, though he was always shy of speaking of it, never ceased to underlie and complicate the moral and historical vision of his work. Images of vulnerability and displacement in his poems project this.\u201d Dorn published numerous poetry collections during his lifetime, often with small presses with limited print runs. He is best known for Slinger (1975), a four-volume epic Western that Marjorie Perloff called \u201cone of the masterpieces of contemporary poetry.\u201d\nReviewing Dorn\u2019s posthumously republished Collected Poems (2012), Patrick McGuinness noted that \u201cDorn's poetry is many things at once: rangy and compressed, rough and refined, metaphysical and crude, slangy and grandiloquent, subtle and hectoring. He has recesses of esoteric knowledge yet his poems are riddled with pop culture, buzzing with philosophy, history, high and low politics, theology and economics.\u201d Dorn\u2019s vernacular, erudite, and insistently political vision was shaped in part by his mentors at Black Mountain College. Dorn spent several years at Black Mountain, where he befriended and studied with poets associated with the school including Charles Olson, Robert Creeley, Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov, William Carlos Williams, and Gary Snyder.\nAlthough poets who were involved with the college have often been grouped together as the Black Mountain poets, Dorn told David Ossman in The Sullen Art that he has \u201cbeen unable to find any similarity\u201d among the writers associated with the school. Discussing his own inclusion in the group, Dorn added: \u201cI think I\u2019m rightly associated with the Black Mountain \u2018school,\u2019 not because of the way I write, but because I was there.\u201d Dorn once told Contemporary Authors: \u201cI\u2019ve always thought that the whole usage of \u2018Black Mountain Poets\u2019 only has an existence in the minds of the people who use it. I don\u2019t even know of such a thing myself. \u2026 I think Black Mountain as a school, irrespective of poets, denotes a certain value toward learning and the analysis of ideas. The perspective that I refer to as a school would refer to the whole school and its history and its conception and its principles and its various periods of authority and so forth\u2014and not to poets, necessarily. I certainly believe that it was a school, in the old sense.\u201d\n\r\nHowever, Dorn\u2019s work is often read as part of a lineage of American poetry that began with William Carlos Williams and extended through Charles Olson. Indeed, several critics have commented that Dorn\u2019s use of free verse and breath-determined rhythms is similar to Olson\u2019s: The Virginia Quarterly Review heralded him as \u201can experienced and accomplished poet who has absorbed Olson, Williams, and Pound and moved beyond them.\u201d Perloff however, suggested that other than some \u201cthematic links, Dorn is really quite unlike Olson; he is, for that matter, quite unlike any poet writing today.\u201d Dorn explained: \u201cThe way I write is really in clots of phrase. \u2026 When the individual line ceases to have energy for me \u2026 I usually break the line there.\u201d\n\r\nDorn\u2019s most influential and highly acclaimed work was the four-volume epic poem, Slinger, which evolved from his earlier poem, \u201cAn Idle Visitation.\u201d Describing the first volume, Gunslinger (1968), as \u201cone of the fine poems of the decade,\u201d Charles Stein predicted that it was \u201cthe first part of what promises to be a major American narrative poem.\u201d Slinger is a fantasy about a demigod-cowboy, the poet-narrator, a madam of a saloon, and a talking horse named Claude Levi-Strauss, all of whom travel southwest America in search of Howard Hughes, a symbol of everything that can and has gone wrong with the modern world. Although Donald Wesling said that Slinger \u201ctends to resist description,\u201d he observed that the poem \u201cis \u2018about\u2019 how and why we spend money and words in this \u2018cosmological\u2019 place; about \u2026 surreal imagery, personifications, the texture of jokes, the paradoxical aspects of thinking \u2026 and about how a self or voice can be differentiated into a cluster of other selves.\u201d\n\nSlinger mixes the jargon of junkies, Westerners, structuralists, and scientists to reflect the jumble of American speech. Dorn intentionally frustrates the reader; syntax is ambiguous, punctuation is sparse, and puns, homonyms, and nonsense words become an integral part of conversation. Wesling declared that such frustration is \u201cone of the pleasures of the poem when you finally discover the mechanism.\u201d Perloff pointed out that Slinger\u2019s collage of language \u201cperfectly embodies Dorn\u2019s theme that nothing is what it seems to be.\u201d This poem as well as many of Dorn\u2019s other writings are set in the western states. In fact, he has referred to himself as \u201ca poet of the West\u2014not by nativity but by orientation.\u201d William J. Lockwood speculated that \u201cthe southwestern landscape would seem to supply to his creative imagination those elements of brightness, clarity, and austerity that correspond to the forms of his own mind and appear as the distinctive qualities of the best of his early poems.\u201d\nDorn\u2019s writing is almost always socially and politically oriented. From his earlier studies of Shoshoni Indians and the transients near Puget Sound to his reflections on the state of America in Slinger, Dorn\u2019s concern for his neighbors is evident in his work. Reviewer Peter Ackroyd argued, \u201cDorn has become the only plausible, political poet in America\u201d because of \u201cthe quality of his response to public situations, not whether that response is \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong.\u2019\u201d When asked about his poetic critique of America for its imperialism, its carelessness with the environment, and its treatment of minorities, Dorn once remarked: \u201cI take democracy very seriously, but on the other hand, it\u2019s a form of government that you have to change your mind about a lot because its form is protean, and its instinct, essentially, comes from a mob psychology. Unlike an adherent to a dogmatic position like Marxism, about which there is very little to change your mind, a democrat is liable to change his mind a lot. So none of these concerns and principles ever leave my mind much, but I vary my attitude according to the angles of perspective I\u2019m able to get on them. Democracy literally has to be cracked on the head all the time to keep it in good condition. But all other forms are more or less sudden death.\u201d\nIn 1965, Dorn moved to England and taught at the University of Essex. While in England he befriended the poet J.H. Prynne and developed important relationships with many small presses that continued to publish his work after he returned the United States in 1970. The period also marked a period of personal upheaval: while in England, Dorn divorced his first wife, Helene Dorn, and married Jennifer Dunbar. Dunbar and Dorn remained married until his death. Derelict Air: From Collected Out (2015), a posthumous gathering of previously published and unpublished poems, some from correspondence and notebooks, provided readers with a sense of how personal Dorn\u2019s often mercurial poetics could be; in a review of the volume Patrick James Dunagan noted, \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to witness Dorn grappling with the utmost of personal crises, interrelating his family and friends with the books in his life and declaring these relationships will either prove enduring or they simply won\u2019t. Just as it might be said his work as a poet will or will not last. He accepts the knowledge of who, along with what, he must leave behind in order to have the opportunity to move ahead. Never one to backtrack or leave what\u2019s on his mind unsaid, Dorn continued on the only way he understood.\u201d\nDorn died of pancreatic cancer in 1999; his last book, Chemo S\u00e1be (2001), recorded the progress and treatment of his illness. \u201cBy the end\u201d of the book, McGuinness noted, \u201cthe poet's consolation is that death (\u2018the relief of my singularity\u2019, as he so nobly puts it) will itself die by fire, as his body carries his tumour into the flames.\u201d\nA long-time teacher of writing, Dorn once told Contemporary Authors that rather than be taught to write, many students are able, instead, to be \u201cprovoked.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say someone can\u2019t be taught to write,\u201d Dorn explained, \u201calthough I\u2019d be inclined to say it. So that\u2019s why I would prefer to say \u2018provoked,\u2019 because it doesn\u2019t involve that question. And I believe it completely. But of course that presupposes an intelligence that\u2019s provokable.\u201d It is perhaps in the provocative union between poetry and political engagement that Dorn most clearly made his mark. In Ackroyd\u2019s opinion, \u201cDorn\u2019s proper achievement has been to create single-handedly a language of public reference, and to have brought within the sphere of expressive language and poetic experience objects and feelings which had been, literally, unimaginable in those terms. It is in this context that he is one of the masters of our contemporary language.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Black Mountain"]}}
