An uncle gave her a volume of Keats, who became an influence on her poetry. Thomas was educated at Geneva Normal School and Oberlin College, though she dropped out after one semester to work. On a visit to New York she met the poet Helen Hunt Jackson, whose early and continued championing of Thomas\u2019s work helped build her reputation. In 1887, Thomas relocated to New York City, where she worked as an editor for Century Dictionary and Harper\u2019s magazine.Thomas published 10 collections of poetry over the course of her career, including Lyrics and Sonnets (1887) and A Winter Swallow (1896).
