As the daughter of a Chippewa Indian mother and a German-American father, Erdrich explores Native-American themes in her works, with major characters representing both sides of her heritage. In an award-winning series of related novels and short stories, Erdrich has visited and re-visited the North Dakota lands where her ancestors met and mingled, representing Chippewa experience in the Anglo-American literary tradition. Many critics claim Erdrich has remained true to her Native ancestors\u2019 mythic and artistic visions while writing fiction that candidly explores the cultural issues facing modern-day Native Americans and mixed heritage Americans. An essayist for Contemporary Novelists observed that \u201cErdrich\u2019s accomplishment is that she is weaving a body of work that goes beyond portraying contemporary Native American life as descendants of a politically dominated people to explore the great universal questions\u2014questions of identity, pattern versus randomness, and the meaning of life itself.\u201d In addition to her numerous award-winning novels and short story collections, Erdrich has published three critically acclaimed collections of poetry, Jacklight (1984), Baptism of Desire (1989) and Original Fire: New and Selected Poems (2003).\nErdrich grew up in North Dakota, where her parents taught at a school run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Erdrich attended Dartmouth College, part of the first class of women admitted to the college; her freshman year also coincided with the establishment of the Native-American studies department. The author\u2019s future husband and collaborator, anthropologist Michael Dorris, was hired to chair the department. In his class, Erdrich began the exploration of her own ancestry that would eventually inspire her poems, short stories and novels. Intent on balancing her academic training with a broad range of practical knowledge, Erdrich told Miriam Berkley in an interview with Publishers Weekly, \u201cI ended up taking some really crazy jobs, and I\u2019m glad I did. They turned out to have been very useful experiences, although I never would have believed it at the time.\u201d Erdrich also became an editor for the Circle, a Boston Indian Council newspaper. She told Writers Digest interviewer Michael Schumacher: \u201cSettling into that job and becoming comfortable with an urban community\u2014which is very different from the reservation community\u2014gave me another reference point. There were lots of people with mixed blood, lots of people who had their own confusions. I realized that this was part of my life\u2014it wasn\u2019t something that I was making up\u2014and that it was something I wanted to write about.\u201d In 1978, the author enrolled in an M.A. program at Johns Hopkins University, where she wrote poems and stories incorporating her heritage, many of which would later become part of her books.\n\r\nAfter receiving her master\u2019s degree, Erdrich returned to Dartmouth as a writer-in-residence. Dorris\u2014with whom she had remained in touch\u2014attended a reading of Erdrich\u2019s poetry there and was impressed. A writer himself\u2014Dorris would later publish the best-selling novel A Yellow Raft in Blue Water (1987) and receive the 1989 National Book Critics Circle Award for his nonfiction work The Broken Cord: A Family\u2019s Ongoing Struggle with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome\u2014he decided then that he was interested in working with Erdrich. Though Dorris left for New Zealand to do field research while Erdrich moved to Boston, the two began collaborating on short stories, including one titled \u201cThe World\u2019s Greatest Fisherman.\u201d When this story won five thousand dollars in the Nelson Algren fiction competition, Erdrich and Dorris decided to expand it into a novel\u2014Love Medicine (1984), which went on to win the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction. At the same time, Dorris had returned from New Zealand and their literary relationship led to a romantic one; they were married in 1981.\n\r\nThe publication of Erdrich\u2019s first novel, Love Medicine, also coincided with her first collection of poems, Jacklight (1984). The poems in Jacklight center on the conflict between Native and non-Native cultures, but they also celebrate family bonds and the ties of kinship, offer autobiographical meditations, dramatic monologues and love poetry, as well as showing the influence of Ojibwa myths and legends. Erdrich has always claimed that her childhood, spent in a community of story-tellers, influenced her work and its concern with narrative. Much of Erdrich\u2019s poetry is narrative poetry, told in direct language that often relies, as in the section of Jacklight entitled \u201cThe Butcher\u2019s Wife,\u201d on dramatic monologue. In Louise Erdrich: A Critical Companion, Lorena Laura Stookey noted that \u201cErdrich began her mature literary career as a poet, and the evidence of her origins can be found in her lyrical prose, in her deft use of imagery and metaphor, and in her employment within her fiction of patterned designs and recurring motifs. She began to move from poetry to fiction in 1980, when she became conscious of the narrative elements at work in her poems.\u201d There is some cross-over in between the novels and poetry: the poem \u201cA Love Medicine\u201d explores similar themes to Erdrich\u2019s first novel, Love Medicine, in addition to sharing its name.\nErdrich\u2019s next collection of poetry, Baptism of Desire (1989), takes its title from an obscure tenet of the Catholic Church. The book itself concerns spirituality and the hybrid form of religion, with Roman Catholic and Native values mingling but also conflicting, that Erdrich grew up practicing. Written during Erdrich\u2019s pregnancy, the volume also includes poems that focus on motherhood and children. The highly-praised poem \u201cHydra,\u201d written while Erdrich was pregnant, evokes her unborn child and a mythical serpent figure, while its speaker compares herself to the Biblical mothers Eve and Mary. In Library Journal, Kathleen Norris noted that throughout the book, Erdrich \u201cappropriates and transforms the Catholic theology learned as a child.\u201d Original Fire: New and Selected Poems (2003) includes many poems from Erdrich\u2019s first two collections, as well as new poems on familiar subjects. In Booklist, Donna Seaman noted \u201cErdrich\u2019s fecund poems are seedbeds for her acclaimed novels,\u201d adding: \u201cDeeply attuned to the sacred as it is manifest in everything from sunlight to stones to water to plants and animals, Erdrich grapples with both Native American and Christian beliefs, and the conflicts ignited by the friction between them, in poems of sweet gratitude, voluptuous ecstasy, cutting satire, seething grief, and fiery resolve.\u201d A reviewer for Publisher\u2019s Weekly noted Erdrich\u2019s influences (Richard Hugo and Louise Gl\u00fcck), but added \u201cErdrich\u2019s particular landscapes and affiliations, and her way with myths and talismans, ensure that her poems, new and old, retain strengths all their own.\u201d\nUndoubtedly, though, it is as a novelist that Erdrich is best known. Over the course of a dozen award-winning and best-selling novels, Erdrich has carved out an important place for herself and her work in contemporary American fiction. Erdrich\u2019s novels Love Medicine (1984), The Beet Queen (1986), Tracks (1988), The Bingo Palace (1994), and Tales of Burning Love (1997), The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse (2001), and Four Souls (2004) encompass the stories of three interrelated families living in and around a reservation in the fictional town of Argus, North Dakota, from 1912 through the present. The novels have been compared to those of William Faulkner, mainly due to the multi-voice narration and non-chronological storytelling which he employed in works such as As I Lay Dying. Erdrich\u2019s works, linked by recurring characters who are victims of fate and the patterns set by their elders, are structured like intricate puzzles in which bits of information about individuals and their relations to one another are slowly released in a seemingly random order, until three-dimensional characters\u2014with a future and a past\u2014are revealed. Through her characters\u2019 antics, Erdrich explores universal family life cycles while also communicating a sense of the changes and loss involved in the twentieth-century Native-American experience.\n\r\nThough Erdrich\u2019s early works were written in collaboration with Michael Dorris, and the couple published a novel together, The Crown of Columbus (1991), the pair separated in 1995 and all of Erdrich\u2019s later work is hers alone. Dorris died by suicide in 1997. The Antelope Wife (1998) was the first book Erdrich released following Dorris\u2019s suicide, and although the author disavowed any relationship between herself and her characters, the story does include a self-destructive husband. In a New York Times review Michiko Kakutani described The Antelope Wife as \u201cone of [Erdrich\u2019s] most powerful and fully imagined novels yet.\u201d Kakutani added: \u201cErdrich has returned to doing what she does best: using multiple viewpoints and strange, surreal tales within tales to conjure up a family\u2019s legacy of love, duty and guilt, and to show us how that family\u2019s fortunes have both shifted\u2014and endured\u2014as its members have abandoned ancient Indian traditions for a modern fast-food existence\u2026As for Ms. Erdrich\u2019s own storytelling powers, they are on virtuosic display in this novel. She has given us a fiercely imagined tale of love and loss, a story that manages to transform tragedy into comic redemption, sorrow into heroic survival. She has given us a wonderfully sad, funny and affecting novel.\u201d Though many of Erdrich\u2019s novels involve the same revolving cast of characters, in The Master Butchers Singing Club (2003), Erdrich focused on the European half of her ancestry, telling the stories of a World War I veteran, his wife and a large cast of characters in a small North Dakota town. The book was a finalist for the National Book Award finalist. Erdrich\u2019s 2008 novel A Plague of Doves was also widely praised and shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize.\nWinner of the National Book Award, Erdrich's novel,\u00a0The Round House (2012),\u00a0is set in 1988 in the same North Dakota Ojibwe reservation as that in\u00a0The Plague of Doves.\u00a0 New York Times Book Review\u00a0writer Maria Russo noted of\u00a0The Round House:\u00a0\"Law is meant to put out society's brush fires, but in Native American history it has often acted more like the wind. Louise Erdrich turns this dire reality into a powerful human story in her new novel.\" Similarly, a\u00a0Publishers Weekly\u00a0reviewer felt that this novel \"pulses with urgency as [Erdrich] probes the moral and legal ramifications of a terrible act of violence.\" A contributor to\u00a0Christian Century\u00a0found this novel to be a \"powerful combination of art and social justice alert.\" \n\r\nErdrich has also written non-fiction, including a chronicle of her pregnancy and the birth of her first child, The Blue Jay\u2019s Dance (1995). She has also published a number of novels for children based on the lives of Native-American young people at the time of white encroachment. Her collected short stories were published as Red Convertible: Collected and New Stories in 2009. Her recent novels include LaRose (2016) and Future Home of the Living God (2017), both from HarperCollins.\nElizabeth Blair declared in World and I: \u201cIn an astonishing, virtuoso performance sustained over more than two decades, Erdrich has produced\u2026interlinked novels that braid the lives of a series of fallible, lovable, and unpredictable characters of German, Cree, m\u00e9tis, and Ojibwe heritage.\u201d Blair continued: \u201cThe painful history of Indian-white relations resonates throughout her work. In her hands we laugh and cry while listening to and absorbing home truths that, taken to heart, have the power to change our world. We listen because these truths come sinew-stitched into the very fabric of the tapestry she weaves so artfully.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
