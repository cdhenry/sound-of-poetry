He earned his BA from St. John\u2019s College, Oxford, where he befriended novelist and poet Kingsley Amis and finished with First Class Honors in English. After graduating, Larkin undertook professional studies to become a librarian. He worked in libraries his entire life, first in Shropshire and Leicester, and then at Queen\u2019s College in Belfast, and finally as librarian at the University of Hull. In addition to collections of poetry, Larkin published two novels\u2014Jill\u00a0(1946) and\u00a0A Girl in Winter\u00a0(1947)\u2014as well as criticism, essays, and reviews of jazz music. The latter were collected in two volumes:\u00a0All What Jazz: A Record Diary 1961-1968\u00a0(1970; 1985) and\u00a0Required Writing: Miscellaneous Pieces 1955-1982\u00a0(1984).\u00a0He was one of post-war England\u2019s most famous poets, and was commonly referred to as \u201cEngland\u2019s\u00a0other\u00a0Poet Laureate\u201d until his death in 1985. Indeed, when the position of laureate became vacant in 1984, many poets and critics favored Larkin\u2019s appointment, but Larkin preferred to avoid the limelight.\nLarkin achieved acclaim on the strength of an extremely small body of work\u2014just over one hundred pages of poetry in four slender volumes that appeared at almost decade-long intervals. These collections, especially\u00a0The Less Deceived\u00a0(1955),\u00a0The Whitsun Weddings\u00a0(1964),\u00a0and\u00a0High Windows\u00a0(1974),\u00a0present \u201ca poetry from which even people who distrust poetry, most people, can take comfort and delight,\u201d according to\u00a0X.J. Kennedy\u00a0in the\u00a0New Criterion.\u00a0Larkin employed the traditional tools of poetry\u2014rhyme, stanza, and meter\u2014to explore the often uncomfortable or terrifying experiences thrust upon common people in the modern age. As\u00a0Alan Brownjohn\u00a0noted in\u00a0Philip Larkin,\u00a0the poet produced without fanfare \u201cthe most technically brilliant and resonantly beautiful, profoundly disturbing yet appealing and approachable, body of verse of any English poet in the last twenty-five years.\u201d\n\r\nDespite his wide popularity, Larkin \u201cshied from publicity, rarely consented to interviews or readings, cultivated his image as right-wing curmudgeon and grew depressed at his fame,\u201d according to\u00a0J.D. McClatchy\u00a0in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review.\u00a0Phoenix\u00a0contributor Alun R. Jones suggests that, as librarian at the remote University of Hull, Larkin \u201cavoided the literary, the metropolitan, the group label, and embraced the nonliterary, the provincial, and the purely personal.\u201d From his base in Hull, Larkin composed poetry that both reflected the dreariness of postwar provincial England and voiced the spiritual despair of the modern age. McClatchy notes Larkin wrote \u201cin clipped, lucid stanzas, about the failures and remorse of age, about stunted lives and spoiled desires.\u201d Critics feel that this localization of focus and the colloquial language used to describe settings and emotions endear Larkin to his readers.\u00a0Agenda\u00a0reviewer George Dekker noted that no living poet \u201ccan equal Larkin on his own ground of the familiar English lyric, drastically and poignantly limited in its sense of any life beyond, before or after, life today in England.\u201d\n\r\nThroughout his life, England was Larkin\u2019s emotional territory to an eccentric degree. The poet distrusted travel abroad and professed ignorance of foreign literature, including most modern American poetry. He also tried to avoid the cliches of his own culture, such as the tendency to read portent into an artist\u2019s childhood. In his poetry and essays, Larkin remembered his early years as \u201cunspent\u201d and \u201cboring,\u201d as he grew up the son of a city treasurer in Coventry. Poor eyesight and stuttering plagued Larkin as a youth; he retreated into solitude, read widely, and began to write poetry as a nightly routine. In 1940 he enrolled at Oxford, beginning \u201ca vital stage in his personal and literary development,\u201d according to Bruce K. Martin in the\u00a0Dictionary of Literary Biography.\u00a0At Oxford Larkin studied English literature and cultivated the friendship of those who shared his special interests, including Kingsley Amis and John Wain. He graduated with first class honors in 1943, and, having to account for himself with the wartime Ministry of Labor, he took a position as librarian in the small Shropshire town of Wellington. While there he wrote both of his novels as well as\u00a0The North Ship,\u00a0his first volume of poetry. After working at several other university libraries, Larkin moved to Hull in 1955 and began a 30-year association with the library at the University of Hull. He is still admired for his expansion and modernization of that facility.\n\r\nLarkin\u2019s\u00a0Selected Letters,\u00a0edited by his longtime friend, poet Anthony Thwaite, reveals much about the writer\u2019s personal and professional life between 1940 and 1985.\u00a0Washington Post Book World\u00a0reviewer John Simon noted that the letters are \u201cabout intimacy, conviviality, and getting things off one\u2019s heaving chest into a heedful ear.\u201d He suggests that \u201cthese cheerful, despairing, frolicsome, often foul-mouthed, grouchy, self-assertive and self-depreciating missives should not be missed by anyone who appreciates Larkin\u2019s verse.\u201d\n\r\nIn a\u00a0Paris Review\u00a0interview, Larkin dismissed the notion that he studied the techniques of poets that he admired in order to perfect his craft. Most critics feel, however, that the poems of both\u00a0William Butler Yeats\u00a0and\u00a0Thomas Hardy\u00a0exerted an influence on Larkin as he sought his own voice. Hardy\u2019s work provided the main impetus to Larkin\u2019s mature poetry, according to critics. A biographer in\u00a0Contemporary Literary Criticism\u00a0claimed \u201cLarkin credited his reading of Thomas Hardy\u2019s verse for inspiring him to write with greater austerity and to link experiences and emotions with detailed settings.\u201d In Nine Contemporary Poets: A Critical Introduction (Methuen, 1979), Peter R. King contends that a close reading of Hardy taught Larkin \u201cthat a modern poet could write about the life around him in the language of the society around him. He encouraged [Larkin] to use his poetry to examine the reality of his own life.\u201d In his work\u00a0Philip Larkin, Martin also claims that Larkin learned from Hardy \u201cthat his own life, with its often casual discoveries, could become poems, and that he could legitimately share such experience with his readers. From this lesson [came Larkin\u2019s] belief that a poem is better based on something from \u2018unsorted\u2019 experience than on another poem or other art.\u201d\nThis viewpoint allied Larkin with the poets of The Movement, a loose association of British writers who \u201ccalled, implicitly in their poetry and fiction and explicitly in critical essays, for some sort of commonsense return to more traditional techniques,\u201d according to Martin in\u00a0Philip Larkin.\u00a0Martin added that the rationale for this \u201cantimodernist, antiexperimental stance is their stated concern with clarity: with writing distinguished by precision rather than obscurity. ... [The Movement urged] not an abandonment of emotion, but a mixture of rationality with feeling, of objective control with subjective abandon. Their notion of what they felt the earlier generation of writers, particularly poets, lacked, centered around the ideas of honesty and realism about self and about the outside world.\u201d King observed that Larkin \u201chad sympathy with many of the attitudes to poetry represented by The Movement,\u201d but this view of the poet\u2019s task antedated the beginnings of that group\u2019s influence. Nonetheless, in the opinion of\u00a0Washington Post Book World\u00a0contributor Chad Walsh, Larkin says \u201cseemed to fulfill the credo of the Movement better than anyone else, and he was often singled out, as much for damnation as for praise, by those looking for the ultimate Movement poet.\u201d Brownjohn concludes that in the company of The Movement, Larkin\u2019s own \u201cdistinctive technical skills, the special subtlety in his adaptation of a very personal colloquial mode to the demands of tight forms, were not immediately seen to be outstanding; but his strengths as a craftsman have increasingly come to be regarded as one of the hallmarks of his talent.\u201d\n\r\nThose strengths of craftsmanship and technical skill in Larkin\u2019s mature works received almost universal approval from literary critics. London\u00a0Sunday Times\u00a0correspondent Ian Hamilton wrote: \u201cSupremely among recent poets, [Larkin] was able to accommodate a talking voice to the requirements of strict metres and tight rhymes, and he had a faultless ear for the possibilities of the iambic line.\u201d David Timms expressed a similar view in his book entitled\u00a0Philip Larkin.\u00a0Technically, notes Timms, Larkin was \u201can extraordinarily various and accomplished poet, a poet who [used] the devices of metre and rhyme for specific effects\u2026 His language is never flat, unless he intends it to be so for a particular reason, and his diction is never stereotyped. He [was] always ready\u2026 to reach across accepted literary boundaries for a word that will precisely express what he intends.\u201d As King explains, Larkin\u2019s best poems \u201care rooted in actual experiences and convey a sense of place and situation, people and events, which gives an authenticity to the thoughts that are then usually raised by the poet\u2019s observation of the scene\u2026 Joined with this strength of careful social observation is a control over tone changes and the expression of developing feelings even within a single poem\u2026 which is the product of great craftsmanship. To these virtues must be added the fact that in all the poems there is a lucidity of language which invites understanding even when the ideas expressed are paradoxical or complex.\u201d\u00a0New Leader\u00a0contributor Pearl K. Bell concludes that Larkin\u2019s poetry \u201cfits with unresisting precision into traditional structures\u2026 filling them with the melancholy truth of things in the shrunken, vulgarized and parochial England of the 1970s.\u201d\n\r\nIf Larkin\u2019s style was traditional, the subject matter of his poetry was derived exclusively from modern life. In the Southern Review, John Press contended that Larkin\u2019s artistic work \u201cdelineates with considerable force and delicacy the pattern of contemporary sensibility, tracing the way in which we respond to our environment, plotting the ebb and flow of the emotional flux within us, embodying in his poetry attitudes of heart and mind that seem peculiarly characteristic of our time: doubt, insecurity, boredom, aimlessness and malaise.\u201d A sense that life is a finite prelude to oblivion underlies many of Larkin\u2019s poems. King suggests that the work is \u201ca poetry of disappointment, of the destruction of romantic illusions, of man\u2019s defeat by time and his own inadequacies,\u201d as well as a study of how dreams, hopes, and ideals \u201care relentlessly diminished by the realities of life.\u201d To Larkin, Brownjohn noted, life was never \u201ca matter of blinding revelations, mystical insights, expectations glitteringly fulfilled. Life, for Larkin, and, implicitly, for all of us, is something lived mundanely, with a gradually accumulating certainty that its golden prizes are sheer illusion.\u201d Love is one of the supreme deceptions of humankind in Larkin\u2019s worldview, as King observed: \u201cAlthough man clutches at his instinctive belief that only love will comfort, console and sustain him, such a hope is doomed to be denied. A lover\u2019s promise is an empty promise and the power to cure suffering through love is a tragic illusion.\u201d Stanley Poss in\u00a0Western Humanities Review\u00a0maintained that Larkin\u2019s poems demonstrate \u201cdesperate clarity and restraint and besieged common sense. And what they mostly say is, be beginning to despair, despair, despair.\u201d\n\r\nLarkin arrived at his conclusions candidly, concerned to expose evasions so that the reader might stand \u201cnaked but honest, \u2018less deceived\u2019 ... before the realities of life and death,\u201d to quote King. Larkin himself offered a rather wry description of his accomplishments\u2014an assessment that, despite its levity, links him emotionally to his work. In 1979 he told the\u00a0Observer:\u00a0\u201cI think writing about unhappiness is probably the source of my popularity, if I have any\u2026 Deprivation is for me what daffodils were for Wordsworth.\u201d\n\r\nCritics can find moments of affirmation in Larkin\u2019s poetry, notwithstanding its pessimistic and cynical bent. Brownjohn admits that Larkin\u2019s works take a bleak view of human existence; at the same time, however, they contain \u201cthe recurrent reflection that others, particularly the young, might still find happiness in expectation.\u201d\u00a0Contemporary Literature\u00a0essayist James Naremore expanded on Larkin\u2019s tendency to detach himself from the action in his poems: \u201cFrom the beginning, Larkin\u2019s work has manifested a certain coolness and lack of self-esteem, a need to withdraw from experience; but at the same time it has continued to show his desire for a purely secular type of romance\u2026 Larkin is trying to assert his humanity, not deny it\u2026 The greatest virtue in Larkin\u2019s poetry is not so much his suppression of large poetic gestures as his ability to recover an honest sense of joy and beauty.\u201d The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0once quoted Larkin as having said that a poem \u201crepresents the mastering, even if just for a moment, of the pessimism and the melancholy, and enables you\u2014you the poet, and you, the reader\u2014to go on.\u201d King sensed this quiet catharsis when he concluded: \u201cAlthough one\u2019s final impression of the poetry is certainly that the chief emphasis is placed on a life \u2018unspent\u2019 in the shadow of \u2018untruth,\u2019 moments of beauty and affirmation are not entirely denied. It is the difficulty of experiencing such moments after one has become so aware of the numerous self-deceptions that man practices on himself to avoid the uncomfortable reality which lies at the heart of Larkin\u2019s poetic identity.\u201d\nDedicated to reaching out for his readers, the poet was a staunch opponent of modernism in all artistic media. Larkin felt that such cerebral experimentation ultimately created a barrier between an artist and the audience and provided unnecessary thematic complications. Larkin\u2019s \u201cdemand for fidelity to experience is supported by his insistence that poetry should both communicate and give pleasure to the reader,\u201d King noted, adding: \u201cIt would be a mistake to dismiss this attitude as a form of simple literary conservatism. Larkin is not so much expressing an anti-intellectualism as attacking a particular form of artistic snobbery.\u201d In\u00a0Philip Larkin,\u00a0Martin commented that the poet saw the need for poetry to move toward the \u201cpaying customer.\u201d Therefore, his writings concretize \u201cmany of the questions which have perplexed man almost since his beginning but which in modern times have become the province principally of academicians\u2026 [Larkin\u2019s poetry reflects] his faith in the common reader to recognize and respond to traditional philosophical concerns when stripped of undue abstractions and pretentious labels.\u201d Brownjohn found Larkin eminently successful in his aims: \u201cIt is indeed true that many of his readers find pleasure and interest in Larkin\u2019s poetry for its apparent accessibility and its cultivation of verse forms that seem reassuringly traditional rather than \u2018modernist\u2019 in respect of rhyme and metre.\u201d As Timms succinctly noted, originality for Larkin consisted \u201cnot in modifying the medium of communication, but in communicating something different.\u201d\n\r\n\u201cMuch that is admirable in the best of [Larkin\u2019s] work is felt [in\u00a0Collected Poems]: firmness and delicacy of cadence, a definite geography, a mutually fortifying congruence between what the language means to say and what it musically embodies,\u201d asserted\u00a0Seamus Heaney\u00a0in the\u00a0Observer.\u00a0The collection contains Larkin\u2019s six previous volumes of poetry as well as 83 of his unpublished poems gleaned from notebooks and homemade booklets. The earliest poems (which reflect the style and social concerns of\u00a0W.H. Auden) date from his schooldays and the latest close to his death. Writing in the Chicago\u00a0Tribune Books,\u00a0Alan Shapiro\u00a0pointed out, \u201cReading the work in total, we can see how Larkin, early and late, is a poet of great and complex feeling.\u201d Larkin \u201c[endowed] the most commonplace objects and occasions with a chilling poignancy, [measuring] daily life with all its tedium and narrowness against the possibilities of feeling,\u201d adds Shapiro.\n\r\nLarkin\u2019s output of fiction and essays is hardly more extensive than his poetry. His two novels,\u00a0Jill\u00a0and\u00a0A Girl in Winter,\u00a0were both published before his 25th birthday.\u00a0New Statesman\u00a0correspondent\u00a0Clive James\u00a0feels that both novels \u201cseem to point forward to the poetry. Taken in their chronology, they are impressively mature and self-sufficient.\u201d James adds that the fiction is so strong that \u201cif Larkin had never written a line of verse, his place as a writer would still have been secure.\u201d Although the novels received little critical attention when they first appeared, they have since been judged highly successful. Brownjohn called\u00a0Jill\u00a0\u201cone of the better novels written about England during the Second World War, not so much for any conscious documentary effort put into it as for Larkin\u2019s characteristic scrupulousness in getting all the background details right.\u201d In the\u00a0New York Review of Books,\u00a0John Bayley noted that\u00a0A Girl in Winter\u00a0is \u201ca real masterpiece, a quietly gripping novel, dense with the humor that is Larkin\u2019s trademark, and also an extended prose poem.\u201d Larkin\u2019s essay collections,\u00a0Required Writing\u00a0and\u00a0All What Jazz,\u00a0are compilations of critical pieces he wrote for periodicals over a 30-year period, including the jazz record reviews he penned as a music critic for the London\u00a0Daily Telegraph.\u00a0\u201cEverything Larkin writes is concise, elegant and wholly original,\u201d Bayley claimed in the\u00a0Listener,\u00a0\u201cand this is as true of his essays and reviews as it is of his poetry.\u201d Elsewhere in the\u00a0New York Review of Books,\u00a0Bayley comments that\u00a0Required Writing\u00a0\u201creveals wide sympathies, deep and trenchant perceptions, a subterraneous grasp of the whole of European culture.\u201d And in an essay on\u00a0All What Jazz\u00a0for Anthony Thwaite\u2019s\u00a0Larkin at Sixty,\u00a0James concludes that \u201cno wittier book of criticism has ever been written.\u201d\n\r\nLarkin stopped writing poetry shortly after his collection\u00a0High Windows\u00a0was published in 1974. In an\u00a0Observer\u00a0obituary, Kingsley Amis characterized the poet as \u201ca man much driven in upon himself, with increasing deafness from early middle age cruelly emphasizing his seclusion.\u201d Small though it is, Larkin\u2019s body of work has \u201caltered our awareness of poetry\u2019s capacity to reflect the contemporary world,\u201d according to\u00a0London Magazine\u00a0correspondent Roger Garfitt. A.N. Wilson drew a similar conclusion in the\u00a0Spectator:\u00a0\u201cPerhaps the reason Larkin made such a great name from so small an\u00a0oeuvre\u00a0was that he so exactly caught the mood of so many of us\u2026 Larkin found the perfect voice for expressing our worst fears.\u201d That voice was \u201cstubbornly indigenous,\u201d according to\u00a0Robert B. Shaw\u00a0in\u00a0Poetry Nation.\u00a0Larkin appealed primarily to the British sensibility; he remained unencumbered by any compunction to universalize his poems by adopting a less regional idiom. Perhaps as a consequence, his poetry sells remarkably well in Great Britain, his readers come from all walks of life, and his untimely cancer-related death in 1985 has not diminished his popularity. Andrew Sullivan feels that Larkin \u201chas spoken to the English in a language they can readily understand of the profound self-doubt that this century has given them. He was, of all English poets, a laureate too obvious to need official recognition.\u201d\n\r\nIn 2002, a notebook containing unpublished poems by Larkin was found in a garbage dump in England, and the notebook\u2019s current owner consulted with auction houses in preparation for selling it. The Society of Authors was to look into legal issues involved in the matter. Then in 2004 came publication of another\u00a0Collected Poems,\u00a0again edited by Thwaite. While the first\u00a0Collected Poems\u00a0from 1989 was arranged chronologically, this was not the order that Larkin himself had used when first publishing them. Additionally, Thwaite published previously unpublished poems and fragments in the earlier volume, drawing some criticism from Larkin scholars. With the 2004\u00a0Collected Poems,\u00a0such matters were corrected. One hundred pages shorter than the earlier volume, and ordered to Larkin\u2019s original desires, this second version \u201cdoes give the verse itself a better shake,\u201d according to\u00a0John Updike\u00a0writing in the\u00a0New Yorker.\u00a0Yet it is hard to please everyone, as Melanie Rehak noted in a\u00a0Nation\u00a0review. \u201cJust as some quibbled when Thwaite diverged from Larkin\u2019s chosen path in his previous collection,\u201d Rehak noted, \u201cthere are absences in this new edition that also diminish it.\u201d However, for Daniel Torday, reviewing the second\u00a0Collected Poems\u00a0in\u00a0Esquire,\u00a0the book was a success. \u201cTwenty years after [Larkin\u2019s] death,\u201d wrote Torday, \u201ca newly revised [version]\u2026 has arrived to remind us that Larkin was more the man\u2019s poet of the 20th century than [Charles] Bukowski or [Jack] Kerouac.\u201d Torday also felt that Larkin was able to ignore \u201cany audience but himself\u2026 That crass, stubborn, and yet unavoidably lovable curmudgeon who tends to poke his head out at the most inopportune times.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
