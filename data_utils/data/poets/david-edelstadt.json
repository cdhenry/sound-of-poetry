He was a buttonhole-maker, an anarchist, an editor, and a poet. He contributed to the Yiddish anarchist newspapers\u00a0Arbeter Fraynd (Workers\u2019 Friend) and Varhayt (Truth), and was editor-in-chief of Fraye Arbeter Shtime (Free Worker\u2019s Voice), where he published poems in tribute to the Haymarket \u201cmartyrs\u201d and to the dignity of workers. His poems were popular among the Jewish working class, and were sung at rallies, sweatshop floors, and on picket lines. Likely due to poor working conditions, he contracted tuberculosis and died at the age of 26 in Denver, Colorado. His collected poems were published posthumously in London and Moscow.\n", "attrs": {}}
