A former editor at Random House, Katz has published many rhyming picture books for elementary school students, including Trailblazers: Poems of Exploration (2007), Once Around the Sun (2006), Pocket Poems (2004), A Rumpus of Rhymes: A Book of Noisy Poems (2001), and Germs! Germs! Germs! (1996). Tonally, these books range from the sublime to the outright ridiculous, and Katz uses rhyme to catch children\u2019s attention in order to educate and entertain them.\nHer books American History Poems\u00a0(1998) and\u00a0We, the People\u00a0(2000) introduce young students to important figures in American history as well as fictitious representative citizens from previous centuries.\u00a0School Library Journal\u00a0contributor Karey Wehner noted that in\u00a0We, the People, \u201ca multitude of Americans are speaking directly to readers.\u201d The critic added that Katz\u2019s book \u201cis unique in offering such a strong sense of time and place.\u201d\nA Rumpus of Rhymes\u00a0\u201cbegs to be shared aloud,\u201d according to Margaret C. Howell in\u00a0School Library Journal. The selection of poems, from short rhyming couplets to longer verses, describe different loud noises that people or inanimate objects can make. These vary from the pop of bubblegum to the grinding din of a washing machine.\u00a0Booklist\u00a0correspondent Lauren Peterson noted that the book \u201coffers plenty of opportunities for kids to be loud and silly.\u201d In the\u00a0New York Times Book Review, Marighy Dupuy wrote, \u201cBobbi Katz does everything right. Not only are her poems engaging and lively, but she puts the words themselves front and center.\u201d Dupuy styled\u00a0A Rumpus of Rhymes\u00a0\u201da celebration of onomatopoeia and delicious nonsense words.\u201d\nKatz once told\u00a0Contemporary Authors: \u201cI write for children because I hope to join those writers and artists who delight, sensitize, and give hope to children.\u201d She has led numerous poetry workshops for children, teachers, and librarians. She lives in upstate New York.\n", "attrs": {}}
