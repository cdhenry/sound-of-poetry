She originally studied sociology, earning both her BA and MA in the subject from Northwestern University. She earned a BA in photography from the Polytechnic of Central London, and an MFA in creative writing from Columbia University. She is the author of numerous collections of poetry, including A Doll for Throwing (2017); The Last Two Seconds (2015); The Bride of E (2009); Elegy (2007), which won both the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Alice Fay di Castagnola Award; Louise in Love (2001); The Downstream Extremity of the Isle of Swans (2001); and Apology for Want (1997), which received the Katherine Bakeless Nason Prize. In 2012 she published a translation of Inferno by Dante Allegheri.\nBang\u2019s poetry has been praised for its linguistic energy, subtle imagery, and innovative technique. Mixing philosophical or postmodern concerns with chiseled, formal control, Bang\u2019s work has been frequently cast as a pioneering example of hybrid poetry. As poet and critic Karla Kelsey has noted, \u201cReviewers like categories, and Bang is bad at staying in them.\u201d Bang\u2019s early collections use poetry to address art, in books such as The Downstream Extremity of the Isle of Swans, or make popular culture a central concern, as in Louise in Love, which revolves around the silent movie actress Louise Brooks. \u201cHer poems are a route to a new way of looking at what we\u2019ve grown into,\u201d argued Frank Allen in the American Book Review, \u201c\u2018the longing\u2019 that restores us to what we once \u2018hoped\u2019 to be.\u201d Bang\u2019s fifth collection, Elegy, won high praise for its profound, meditative lyrics on loss. Written in the wake of her adult son\u2019s death, the book was described by David Orr in the New York Times as, \u201ca tightly focused, completely forthright collection written almost entirely in the bleakest key imaginable.\u201d He continued, \u201cCollectively [the poems] are overwhelming\u2014which is both a compliment to Bang\u2019s talent and to the toughness of mind that allowed her to attempt this difficult project in the first place.\u201d Bang\u2019s follow-up to Elegy is an abecedarian, taking its organizing principles from the alphabet. The Bride of E was praised by Kelsey for its self-aware positioning, even its reversal of the single-subject laments of Elegy. Kelsey noted that the book \u201cof course reflects [Bang\u2019s] image reservoirs and gestures, but it does not have the autobiographical focus that Elegy (and elegies in general) demand. The book is much more about the way we still can make use of worn-out images and phrases to ask existential questions of the post-postmodern world.\u201d\nBang discussed her circuitous route to professional poet\u2014including years of working as a professional photographer and physician\u2019s assistant\u2014with the journal 99 Percent: \u201cI could see myself getting closer and closer,\u201d she said of her years learning photography. \u201cOver time, what was on the film and the photographic paper more and more resembled what I\u2019d imagined when I looked into the viewfinder. And I saw how, if you steadily worked at something, what you don\u2019t know gradually erodes and what you do know slowly grows and at some point you\u2019ve gained a degree of mastery. What you know becomes what you are. You know photography and you are a photographer. You know writing and you are a writer.\u201d\nBang has received numerous honors and awards for her work, including the Berlin Prize, fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the Bellagio Foundation, and a Hodder Fellowship from Princeton University. She has received a \u201cDiscovery\u201d/The Nation award and a Pushcart Prize, and her poems have been included in multiple editions of The Best American Poetry. Bang served as editor of the Boston Review from 1995 to 2005. From 2003 to 2006, she was the director of the creative writing program at Washington University in St. Louis.\nIn April 2013, she was a featured writer for Harriet.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
