He was a member of the generation of British poets who came to prominence in the 1930s, a group\u2014sometimes referred to as the Oxford Poets\u2014that included\u00a0W.H. Auden, Christopher Isherwood, C. Day Lewis, and\u00a0Louis MacNeice. In an essay on Spender\u2019s work in Chicago Tribune Book World, Gerald Nicosia wrote, \u201cWhile preserving a reverence for traditional values and a high standard of craftsmanship, [these poets] turned away from the esotericism of\u00a0T.S. Eliot, insisting that the writer stay in touch with the urgent political issues of the day and that he speak in a voice whose clarity can be understood by all.\u201d Spender\u2019s numerous books of poetry include\u00a0Dolphins (1994), Collected Poems, 1928-1985, The Generous Days\u00a0(1971), Poems of Dedication\u00a0(1946), and The Still Centre (1939).\nDuring World War II, Spender worked for the London fire service. From 1965 to 1966, he served as the consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. He was professor of English at University College, London from 1970 to 1977, and he frequently gave lectures at universities in the United States. He was knighted in 1983.\nSpender\u2019s name was most frequently associated with that of W.H. Auden, perhaps the most famous poet of the 1930s. However, some critics, including Alfred Kazin and Helen Vendler, found the two poets dissimilar in many ways. In the\u00a0New Yorker,\u00a0for example, Vendler observed that \u201cat first [Spender] imitated Auden\u2019s self-possessed ironies, his determined use of technological objects. \u2026 But no two poets can have been more different. Auden\u2019s rigid, brilliant, peremptory, categorizing, allegorical mind demanded forms altogether different from Spender\u2019s dreamy, liquid, guilty, hovering sensibility. Auden is a poet of firmly historical time, Spender of timeless nostalgic space.\u201d In the\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0Kazin similarly concluded that Spender \u201cwas mistakenly identified with Auden. Although they were virtual opposites in personality and in the direction of their talents, they became famous at the same time as \u2018pylon poets\u2019\u2014among the first to put England\u2019s gritty industrial landscape of the 1930s into poetry.\u201d\n\r\nThe term \u201cpylon poets\u201d refers to \u201cThe Pylons,\u201d a poem by Spender that many critics described as typical of the Auden generation. The much-anthologized work, included in one of Spender\u2019s earliest collections,\u00a0Poems (1933),\u00a0as well as in his Collected Poems, 1928-1985, includes imagery characteristic of the group\u2019s style and reflects the political and social concerns of its members. In The Angry Young Men of the Thirties (1976), Elton Edward Smith recognized that in such a poem, \u201cthe poet, instead of closing his eyes to the hideous steel towers of a rural electrification system and concentrating on the soft green fields, glorifies the pylons and grants to them the future. And the nonhuman structure proves to be of the very highest social value, for rural electrification programs help create a new world of human equality.\u201d\n\r\nThe 1930s were marked by turbulent events that would shape the course of history: the worldwide economic depression, the Spanish Civil War, and the beginnings of World War II. Seeing the established world crumbling around them, the writers of the period sought to create a new reality to replace the old, which, in their minds, had become obsolete. For a time, Spender, like many young intellectuals of the era, was a member of the communist party. \u201cSpender believed,\u201d Smith noted, \u201cthat communism offered the only workable analysis and solution of complex world problems, that it was sure eventually to win, and that for significance and relevance the artist must somehow link his art to the Communist diagnosis.\u201d Smith described Spender\u2019s poem, \u201cThe Funeral\u201d (included in\u00a0Collected Poems: 1928-1953, published in 1955, but omitted from the 1985 revision of the same work), as \u201ca Communist elegy.\u201d Smith observed that much of Spender\u2019s other works from the same early period\u2014including his play,\u00a0Trial of a Judge: A Tragedy in Five Acts (1938),\u00a0his poems in\u00a0Vienna (1934),\u00a0and his essays in\u00a0The Destructive Element: A Study of Modern Writers and Beliefs\u00a0(1935) and\u00a0Forward from Liberalism (1935)\u2014address communism. In Poets of the Thirties, D.E.S. Maxwell commented, \u201cthe imaginative writing of the thirties created an unusual\u00a0milieu\u00a0of urban squalor and political intrigue. This kind of statement\u2014a suggestion of decay producing violence and leading to change\u2014as much as any absolute and unanimous political partisanship gave this poetry its marxist reputation. Communism and \u2018the communist\u2019 (a poster-type stock figure) were frequently invoked.\u201d\nThe attitudes Spender developed in the 1930s continued to influence him throughout his life. As Peter Stansky pointed out in the\u00a0New Republic,\u00a0\u201cThe 1930s were a shaping time for Spender, casting a long shadow over all that came after. \u2026 It would seem that the rest of his life, even more than he may realize, has been a matter of coming to terms with the 1930s, and the conflicting claims of literature and politics as he knew them in that decade of achievement, fame, and disillusion.\u201d\nSpender continued to write poetry throughout his life, but it came to consume less of his literary output in later years than it did in the 1930s and 1940s. Critics praised his work as an autobiographer and critic. In a\u00a0Times Literary Supplement\u00a0review, Julian Symons noted \u201cthe candor of the ceaseless critical self-examination [Spender] has conducted for more than half a century in autobiography, journals, criticism, poems.\u201d Stansky believed that Spender was at his best when he was writing autobiography. The poet himself pointed echoed this assertion in the postscript to\u00a0The Thirties and After: Poetry, Politics, People, 1933-1970 (1978): \u201cI myself am, it is only too clear, an autobiographer. Autobiography provides the line of continuity in my work. I am not someone who can shed or disclaim his past.\u201d\nIn the 1980s, Spender\u2019s writing\u2014The Journals of Stephen Spender, 1939-1983, Collected Poems, 1928-1985,\u00a0and\u00a0Letters to Christopher: Stephen Spender\u2019s Letters to Christopher Isherwood, 1929-1939, in particular\u2014placed a special emphasis on autobiographical material. In the New York Times Book Review, critic Samuel Hynes commented that \u201cthe person who emerges from [Spender\u2019s] letters is neither a madman nor a fool, but an honest, intelligent, troubled young man, groping toward maturity in a troubled time. And the author of the journals is something more; he is a writer of sensitivity and power.\u201d\nOne of Spender\u2019s earliest published works of autobiography,\u00a0World within World (1951),\u00a0created a stir due to Spender\u2019s frank disclosure of a queer relationship he had had at around the time of the Spanish Civil War. In 1990s, the book became the subject of a controversy when American writer David Leavitt published While England Sleeps (1993). In this novel, many details in the portrayal of a character\u2019s affair mirror experiences Spender shared in his autobiography. Spender accused Leavitt of plagiarism and filed a lawsuit in British courts to stop the British publication of the book. In 1994, Leavitt and his publisher, Viking Penguin, agreed to a settlement that would withdraw the book from publication; Leavitt made changes to\u00a0While England Sleeps\u00a0for a revised edition. During this period of intense attention focused on\u00a0World within World,\u00a0St. Martin\u2019s reprinted the autobiography with a new introduction by Spender. As a result, many readers had the opportunity to discover or rediscover Spender\u2019s work. \u201cWith the passage of time,\u201d commented Eric Pace in a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0obituary, \u201cWorld within World has proved to be in many ways Sir Stephen\u2019s most enduring prose work because it gives the reader revealing glimpses of its author, Auden and Mr. Isherwood and of what it was like to be a British poet in the 1930s.\u201d\nSpender died in 1995.\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
