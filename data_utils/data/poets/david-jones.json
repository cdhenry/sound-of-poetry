He is best known for his long narrative poems In Parenthesis (1937) and The Anathemata (1952), and for his engravings and paintings, which have won many awards. While not as well known as other modernist writers such as T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and James Joyce, Jones \u201cis increasingly regarded as an important, innovative poet, who has extended and refined the techniques of literary modernism,\u201d according to Dictionary of Literary Biography contributor Vincent B. Sherry, Jr. \u201cThe supreme quality of his art,\u201d both literary and graphic, reports Kathleen Raine in the Sewanee Review, \u201c... has long been apparent to an inner circle of his friends,\u201d but, she adds, \u201che has never at any time been a widely-read, still less a fashionable, writer, nor is he ever likely to become so, for his work is too subtle and learned for popular tastes.\u201d\nMuch of Jones\u2019s work evokes his Welsh heritage and echoes the events of his own life. \u201cAt the time of my birth,\u201d he once told Contemporary Authors, \u201cmy father was a printer\u2019s overseer and that meant that I was brought up in a home that took the printed page and its illustration for granted. I began drawing when I was aged five and regarded it as a natural activity which I would pursue as I grew older. I was backward at lessons, could not read til I was about seven or eight, and did not take to writing in the sense of writing books until I was thirty-three years old.\u201d\nIn January 1915, Jones enlisted in the Royal Welch Fusiliers as an infantryman, and he served on the Western front from December of that year to March 1918. After the war he embraced Roman Catholicism and joined a small community of Catholic artists headed by craftsman Eric Gill, among whom he began to develop a unique concept of art and the function of the artist. He did not begin to write In Parenthesis, a fictionalized account of his activities in the war, until 1928 and almost a decade passed before it was published. Jones\u2019s war experiences and his religious conversion permeate his first long poem. Like Jones, John Ball, the protagonist of In Parenthesis, served in the British army on the Western Front during World War I. Both Jones and Ball began training late in 1915, and both were wounded in the battle of the Somme in June of 1916. His second long poem, The Anathemata, reflects the poet\u2019s Catholic faith and understanding of his art. Set during the Consecration of the Mass, it encompasses the entire history of mankind. Other works display Jones\u2019s eclectic tastes, depicting scenes from Celtic literature and mythology, Arthurian legend, Greek and Roman antiquity, and scripture.\nComplex in organization, rich in vocabulary, In Parenthesis demonstrates the intricacies of Jones\u2019s work. David Blamires points out in David Jones: Artist and Writer that \u201cin length and overall structure ... [it] may be said to be a novel, but in its use of language it is more akin to poetry.\u201d The poem is divided into seven parts, and tells the story of Private John Ball and his company from their embarkation from England in December 1915 to their participation in the Somme battle of July 1916. \u201cBut though Ball is usually present as protagonist-spectator,\u201d declares Monroe K. Spears in Contemporary Literature, \u201cthe poem expresses not his thoughts alone but, most of the time, a kind of collective consciousness; and hence many different forms and levels are necessary. ... All the details of speech and everything else are vivid, precise, and evocative: but literal realism is immediately transcended.\u201d \u201cIn Parenthesis varies in medium from straightforward prose to prose that is highly elliptical, condensed, dislocated, and discontinuous and to verse with a rhythm that is sometimes very strong\u2014allusive, liturgical, or incantory\u2014but that never employs rhyme or any regular pattern,\u201d Spears explains. \u201cThe result is a profound and shattering disclosure of combat\u2019s physical destruction and spiritual outrage,\u201d asserts Thomas Dilworth in the Georgia Review, \u201cwhich is sustained by a controlled and variegated tone lacking in the work of the combatant poets who wrote during the war.\u201d\nJones draws on his Welsh literary heritage to describe his experiences. Each of the seven parts of the poem is prefaced with a quotation from an ancient Welsh heroic epic, Y Gododdin, which commemorates the destruction of a 300-man raiding party by the English at the battle of Catraeth. The poet also takes images from Shakespeare\u2019s history plays and Malory\u2019s Morte d\u2019Arthur, as well as from T.S. Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land, mingling with them expressions from the early 20th century and soldiers\u2019 slang from the war. Paul Fussell points out in The Great War and Modern Memory that at the end of the first section of the poem the newly trained soldiers \u201cset toward France,\u201d just as Henry V does in Shakespeare\u2019s play. Part IV is titled \u201cKing Pellam\u2019s Launde,\u201d in reference to the desolate country in which King Arthur\u2019s knights find the Holy Grail in the Morte d\u2019Arthur. Also drawn from Malory is Ball\u2019s fellow soldier Dai Greatcoat, who rises after the platoon\u2019s meal and delivers a warrior\u2019s boast, patterned after those that appear in epic poetry, in which he claims to have participated in every major battle in history and legend from the fall of Lucifer to the present. He declares that his fathers were present at Edward III\u2019s victory over the French at Crecy, and asserts that he took part in Arthur\u2019s wars and was a member of the Roman legion that crucified Jesus.\nMany critics hold that the archetypal figure Dai Greatcoat and indeed all Jones\u2019s soldiers represent the human experience in war throughout the ages. New York Review of Books contributor D.S. Carne-Ross maintains, \u201cJones came in retrospect to see the first of our \u2018great\u2019 modern wars (at least up to the battle of the Somme) as the last action of an older world, the last time that the ancient usages still just held, hence it represented what he and his friends called the Break, the point at which man stepped clear of his past and turned his back on all the previous history of the race.\u201d \u201cFaced with the disintegration brought about by the First World War, David Jones sought to recover roots, not just for an individual, but for a whole people,\u201d declares Atholl C.C. Murray in Critical Quarterly. \u201cThis he attempted by constantly emphasising the continuity of history, by showing that the present derives from the past and that both are part of the one process. Thus it is that at various times his Londoners and Welshmen may be assimilated to the three hundred who fought at Catraeth, or to the troops under Henry V at Agincourt, or even to the Roman legionaries.\u201d Samuel Rees, writing in David Jones, states that \u201cthe racial or mythic ancestry that Jones provides for them places them in the whole history of recorded time; they share the human psyche of the soldiers at Catraeth, at the Crucifixion, at Malplaquet, at Harfleur, wherever man has organized war against his own kind.\u201d\nWhile all commentators recognize In Parenthesis as an important literary achievement, they are divided in their assessments of its success in representing the experience of the First World War. Some believe, as does Michael Mott of Poetry magazine, that \u201cIn Parenthesis seems an astonishingly successful combining of epic myth and actuality.\u201d Yet Jones\u2019s verse is decidedly understated compared to that of the heroic bards. \u201cIn chronicling the action of which he was a part, [Jones] does not seek to be an epic poet singing hymns of battle in which new heroes reenact the earth-shaking deeds of their ancestors,\u201d reports Rees. \u201cWithout apology or special pleading, he details from intimate firsthand acquaintance with the present\u2014and from affectionate intimacy with historical man\u2014the minds and actions of those compelled, for whatever reason, whatever \u2018accidents\u2019 of history and geography, to go \u2018once more into the breach.\u2019\u201d Yet John H. Johnson, writing in English Poetry of the First World War, argues that the poem is indeed an epic, and Dilworth agrees; in The Shape of Meaning in the Poetry of David Jones, he states that In Parenthesis \u201cis the only authentic and successful epic poem in the language since Paradise Lost.\u201d\nIn some critics\u2019 opinions, In Parenthesis presents an ambiguous vision of the war. Carne-Ross remarks, \u201cWhat is largely missing is the note of protest, the sense of war as an aberration, something that must never be allowed to happen again.\u201d Nonetheless, he concludes, the poet\u2019s perspective is understandable: \u201cWar is hell, certainly, but Jones never doubted that there is a good deal of hell around and this aspect of the matter did not greatly surprise him.\u201d Dilworth acknowledges that the poem is not primarily interested in promoting pacifism but, he declares, \u201cIts ironies are double-edged; they indict war but also stress the essential goodness of the individual combatant.\u201d Rees concludes that \u201cIn Parenthesis is not a poem either to provoke or to end a war ... except as it adds to the accumulation of testimony to the stupidities and brutality of history that each age much learn from or, more likely, ignore.\u201d\nCritics also disagree in their interpretations of the poem\u2019s attempt to understand the war. Murray, for instance, calls In Parenthesis \u201ca book about how man, even in the most appalling circumstances, can still discern beneath the surface of experience an ultimate significance in life.\u201d \u201cIf one is ready to perceive it,\u201d he concludes, \u201cthen there is order and beauty to be discovered even in the lice-ridden marshes of Flanders.\u201d On the other hand, Fussell disagrees with this interpretation of the war. He believes that In Parenthesis suggests, by placing the suffering of modern British soldiers in an epic, heroic context, \u201cthat the war, if ghastly, is firmly \u2018in the tradition.\u2019 It even implies that, once conceived to be in the tradition, the war can be understood. The tradition to which the poem points holds suffering to be close to sacrifice and individual effort to end in heroism; it contains, unfortunately, no precedent for an understanding of war as a shambles and its participants as victims.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet for all these defects,\u201d Fussell admits, \u201cIn Parenthesis remains in many ways a masterpiece impervious to criticism.\u201d The poem, he concludes, is \u201cprofoundly decent. When on his twenty-first birthday Mr. Jenkins [the commander of Ball\u2019s platoon] receives both his promotion to full lieutenant and a nice parcel from Fortnum and Mason\u2019s, we are pleased. Details like these pull the poem in quite a different direction from that indicated by its insistent invocation of myth and ritual and romance. Details like these persuade us with all the power of art that the Western Front is not King Pellam\u2019s Land, that it will not be restored and made whole, ever, by the expiatory magic of the Grail. It is too human for that.\u201d\nIn Parenthesis was recognized at the time of its publication in 1937 as a work of immense literary importance and continues to be celebrated as such today. In The Long Conversation: A Memoir of David Jones, William Blisset reports that, at a party celebrating the poem\u2019s winning the Hawthornden Prize, William Butler Yeats \u201cbowed and intoned: \u2018I salute the author of In Parenthesis.\u2019\u201d T. S. Eliot also praised the work, and many critics acclaimed it highly. \u201cHerbert Read, writing for the London Mercury,\u201d relates Sherry, \u201cfound it \u2018as near a great epic of the war as ever the war generation will reach,\u2019 displaying \u2018the noble ardour of the Chanson de Roland and the rich cadences of the Morte d\u2019Arthur.\u2019\u201d New York Times Book Review contributor Stephen Spender has called In Parenthesis \u201cthe most monumental work of poetic genius to come out of World War I.\u201d Dilworth echoes his assessment, saying, \u201cBy most accounts, In Parenthesis ... is the finest work of literature to emerge from combat experience in the First World War.\u201d\nBetween 1937 and 1952 Jones worked on a variety of poems, but published very little. A nervous disorder developing from his war experiences prevented his holding a steady job, and his income depended mainly on the generosity of his friends. Pressures from his uncertain earnings aggravated his condition, and in 1946 he suffered a mental collapse that required a rest of nearly a year and a half. In the interim Jones worked on his painting and poetry and further developed his theory of art and artistry, expressing his views in letters and essays. It was not until 1952, with the encouragement of T.S. Eliot and other friends, that he published The Anathemata, which partly expounds his aesthetic philosophy and partly expresses his personal faith.\nLike In Parenthesis, The Anathemata is modernistic, allusive, and fragmented, but it lacks the chronological storyline that characterizes the earlier work. Instead, it consists of eight separate sections, tracing various traditions of British and European culture, and unified by the image of the Mass. \u201cIt is the only epic-length work in any language, as far as I know,\u201d declares Dilworth in The Shape of Meaning, \u201cin which structure successfully replaces narrative as the primary principle of order. And more than merely ordering content, the structure of The Anathemata gives it powerful symbolic focus.\u201d \u201cThe Anathemata does not have the confined narrative structure or the clear identification with classical epic of In Parenthesis,\u201d asserts Rees. \u201cMore ambitious, certainly, than that work, it attempts something approaching the whole cultural history of the British Isles.\u201d Nicholas Jacobs declares in Agenda, \u201cWhereas in In Parenthesis Jones uses a single major theme, the ideal of comradeship in arms from Aneirin through Malory to Shakespeare, in an attempt to give sense and meaning to the terrible waste of the Western Front, in The Anathemata he is concerned much more to recall and celebrate a whole tradition which threatens to slip through his fingers.\u201d \u201cIn Parenthesis tested the military and liturgical forms of order and found them lacking, with neither efficacy for salvation nor effectiveness for survival,\u201d Rees reminds us. \u201cThe Queen of the Woods, the great earth-goddess, the eternal female principle venerated by myth throughout the centuries, alone could restore order\u2014but post mortem. In The Anathemata Jones renominates and celebrates the liturgy as the redemptive order for the living, as an art form.\u201d Rees concludes, \u201cIn intention and scope Jones\u2019s poem is truly epic and might be said to rival in ambition Milton\u2019s attempt to \u2018justify the ways of God to Men\u2019 for an age which urges art to be at the service of the ego, the State, or itself.\u201d\n\u201cClearly,\u201d Rees asserts, \u201cit is the whole of human history and prehistory as perceived and experienced by Western man that is Jones\u2019s province.\u201d The \u201canathemata\u201d of the poem\u2019s title refers to the artifacts that an artist produces, including the graphic and plastic arts, poetry, literature, legend\u2014all the things that help define a culture. The work examines the accumulation of these artifacts from earliest times to the present, with special attention paid to that which has had the greatest influence on the poet: the history, both legendary and factual, \u201cof the Island of Britain as a whole, whose various origins, Celtic, Imperial Roman, Western Christian and Saxon, appear there in the form in which the poet himself, by birth, upbringing and conversion a product of the composite tradition, experiences them,\u201d Jacobs explains. \u201cTo read [the poem],\u201d declares Rees, \u201cis to engage, in a rare, esoteric way, from a most learned and demanding tutor, in a course in Western Civilization, which is something other than learning the sites of famous battles in Greece and being able to recite, in order, the rulers of Rome and the kings and queens of England.\u201d\nThe Anathemata was Jones\u2019s attempt to reestablish contact with these roots of British culture, states Seamus Heaney in the Spectator, roots that modern Britain had neglected, especially in the years after the First World War. Heaney explains, \u201cHis effort has been to graft a healing tissue over that wound in English consciousness inflicted by the Reformation and the Industrial Revolution.\u201d Jones felt that modern man had lost his understanding of the past by neglecting the history of his culture. Drawing information from the sciences of archaeology and anthropology, he set out to recover the roots of his heritage. The poem, Rees declares, tells the history of the artist from \u201chis emergence from the reaches of prehistory, from rocks and caves that he decorated, as at Lascaux, adorning burial sites gratuitously, creating objects that are beautiful to an extrautile degree, and continuing, still an artmaker, to the wasted present, \u2018at the sagging end and chapter\u2019s close.\u2019\u201d\nJones uses his traditions in such a way that they become understandable even to those who do not share the poet\u2019s background. Kathleen Raine in her book David Jones and the Actually Loved and Known states, \u201cThe poet does not thrust his facts upon us, but rather uses these to remind us of our own, often untreasured but none the less precious, fragments of the same totality.\u201d Instead Jones concentrates on the universal legacies of mankind. \u201cIn the larger sense,\u201d Rees explains, \u201cman\u2019s \u2018anathemata\u2019 defines all that legacy of man that is his, that is he.\u201d The critic concludes that the poet\u2019s ideal aim \u201cis to discover via surviving art and artifact and written word, and with application of all the modern insights and methods of literary study, anthropology, comparative religion, and linguistics, the essential human heritage that is ours.\u201d He says, \u201cDavid Jones\u2019s life work is finally his testimony to this central credo: \u2018We were then homo faber, homo sapiens before Lascaux and we shall be homo faber, homo sapiens after the last atomic bomb has fallen.\u2019\u201d\nClosely tied to Jones\u2019s concept of man-as-artist is his understanding of Christianity. The Anathemata demonstrates his belief that art should be a form of worship, and that worship is itself a form of art. Guy Davenport remarks in the New York Times Book Review, \u201cFor David Jones art was a sacred act and he expected the reading of his work to be as much a rite as he performed in the composing of it.\u201d \u201cArt, as Jones\u2019s impractical temperament would have it,\u201d explains Sherry, \u201cis essentially gratuitous, intransitive; it serves no social purpose; it is, ideally, a free hymn of praise to God, and as such resembles the gift offerings of sacrament.\u201d\nBut if art can be considered a type of sacrament, the sacraments themselves are a form of art\u2014perhaps, in Jones\u2019s opinion, the highest form. \u201cAt the center of The Anathemata is that cross, the \u2018Axile Tree,\u2019\u201d Rees reports. \u201cChrist being lifted up made an efficacious sign, made \u2018anathemata\u2019 of his own body.\u201d Belief in the veracity of the Christian gospel is not necessary for the reader, he continues, because \u201cWestern man\u2019s whole being, his history, his ancestry, his \u2018res,\u2019 is wholly bound up in that myth.\u201d \u201cThe art of the first Eucharist at the Last Supper redefines all preceding art, even as it was an act that with all its reverberations and implications transformed succeeding events and imparted a unique and new order to Western myth, legend, and history,\u201d he concludes. \u201cThe priest lifting the wafer of bread in the Mass is the supreme artist,\u201d Sherry declares. \u201cThe Mass thus provides a kind of infinite moment; its sacrament is the timeless archetype of all the artifacts catalogued in the poem.\u201d \u201cLike Joyce, [Jones] has made a total anachronism of all history, so that the Crucifixion is both an event in time, upon which all perspectives converge, and an event throughout time,\u201d Davenport states. \u201cThe purpose of the evolution of the world was to raise the hill Golgotha, grow the wood for the cross, form the iron for the nails and develop the primate species Homo sapiens for God to be born a member of,\u201d he asserts. \u201cThe paleolithic Willendorf \u2018Venus\u2019 is therefore as valid and eloquent a Madonna as one by Botticelli, and all soldiers belong to the Roman legion that detailed a work group to execute, by slow torture, the Galilean visionary troublemaker.\u201d\nThe Anathemata met with mixed reactions from its reviewers. Some critics felt that the complexity of the poem made it too difficult to understand. Many others, however, agreed with W.H. Auden, who declared in Encounter that The Anathemata \u201cis one of the most important poems of our times.\u201d According to Blamires, it had been \u201chailed by one critic as one of the five \u2018major poetic efforts of our era\u2019 in English.\u201d Jones particularly enjoyed Raine\u2019s assessment of The Anathemata which appeared in the New Statesman, says Sherry: \u201cSuch is the paradox of our time that the more a poet draws on objective tradition, the less on subjective experiences, the more obscure he will seem.\u201d Contemporary reviewers continue to appreciate the power of its language. N.K. Sandars, writing in Agenda, states, \u201cWe have become numbed, anaesthetized to the power and purpose of words and require to be jolted awake, to feel their recessions and transformations. This is exactly what David Jones has done in The Anathemata ... where juxtapositions of English, Welsh and Latin give, not only an incomparable richness of texture and of reference, but also give words the life of icons, \u2018images not made with hands.\u2019\u201d\nIn the remaining years of his life, Jones continued to refine his theory of art and the function of the artist, often in letters to friends, but also in his essays collected in Epoch and Artist. He also worked on shorter poems and essays, some of which were collected in the books The Sleeping Lord and Other Fragments (1974), The Dying Gaul and Other Writings (1978), and The Roman Quarry and Other Sequences (1981). Many of them echo the problems that Jones confronted in The Anathemata; some reveal the unrest of Roman legionaries on the borders of the decaying Empire, reflecting \u201cthe problems of a political order removed from its local origins,\u201d says Sherry. Others\u2014many of which are based on figures from Celtic myth and legend\u2014\u201cpraise the virtues of local, rooted culture,\u201d he continues. Often these poems were published in a consciously unfinished state as works in progress, but even in their fragmentary condition reviewers recognized the power of Jones\u2019s work. Heaney concludes his review of The Sleeping Lord by calling Jones \u201can extraordinary writer\u201d who has \u201creturned to the origin and brought something back, something to enrich not only the language but people consciousness of who they have been and who they consequently are.\u201d\nDespite his acclaim in poetic circles\u2014Dilworth calls him \u201cthe most important native British poet of the twentieth century\u201d in The Shape of Meaning\u2014David Jones continues to be unknown to the public at large. This is partly due to the demands the poet\u2019s work makes on readers, but also partly the result of his own preference. Rees explains, \u201cThere have been few writers of this or any other age so resolutely uninterested in matters of public reputation or recognition.\u201d He spent the last years of his life quietly working, trying to salvage the remnants of traditional Western culture from the onslaught of the 20th century. \u201cLike Thoreau, Melville and Hopkins,\u201d Spender concludes, \u201che was one of literature\u2019s saints who speak with an authority that comes more from religion than from the world of letters.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Wales"], "School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
