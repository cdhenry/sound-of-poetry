In a 2005 interview with poet Leonard Schwartz for\u00a0Jacket\u00a0magazine, Toscano stated, \u201cOne of the things that you can do in culture, and specifically poetic discourse, is bring what\u2019s allegedly high philosophic discourse to bump up against the demotic, or everyday kind of speech. \u2026 If you bring heterogeneous elements into your poetry you have a better chance at shooting the gaps of where you would want to liberate yourself.\u201d In a 2007 review of\u00a0Collapsible Poetics Theater\u00a0for\u00a0Sustainable Aircraft, J. Gordon Faylor notes that the work \u201cinduces territories of dissent and identity, both of and beyond the stage; it suggests an ever-shifting set of our own subjectivities and those of the people (and objects) around us.\u201d\n\r\nToscano is the author of several collections of poetry, including\u00a0Partisans (1999),\u00a0The Disparities\u00a0(2002),\u00a0Collapsible Poetics Theater\u00a0(2008), which was chosen for the National Poetry Series,\u00a0Deck of Deeds\u00a0(2012), and\u00a0Explosion Rocks Springfield\u00a0(2017), In Range (2019).\u00a0Collapsible Poetics Theater\u00a0is also a traveling \u201ctest of poetry\u201d for which Toscano serves as artistic director and writer for volunteer performances engaging the intersection of poetry and theater. His plays and body-movement poems have been performed at the Disney Redcat Theater in Los Angeles, Links Hall in Chicago, Ontological-Hysteric Poet\u2019s Theater Festival, and elsewhere.\n\r\nToscano\u2019s work has been included in the anthologies\u00a0Angels of the Americlypse\u00a0(2014),\u00a0Against Expression\u00a0(2011), Diasporic Avant-Gardes\u00a0(2011), Poetic Voices Without Borders\u00a0(2009),\u00a0Best American Poetry\u00a0(2004), Dialectical Imaginaries (2018),\u00a0and\u00a0The Criminal\u2019s Cabinet: An Anthology of Poetry and Fiction\u00a0(2004). His work has been translated into several languages, and his radio pieces have aired on stations across the country. Toscano is also the recipient of a New York State Fellowship in Poetry.\n\r\nToscano\u00a0works for the Labor Institute in conjunction with the United Steelworkers, the National Institute for Environmental Health Science, Communication Workers of America, and National Day Laborers Organizing Network, working on educational and training projects that involve environmental and labor justice, health and safety culture transformation, and immigrant worker rights. After 16 years in Brooklyn, New York, Toscano now lives in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic", "U.S., Western"]}}
