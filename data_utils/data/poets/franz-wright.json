He earned a BA from Oberlin College in 1977. His collections of poetry include The Beforelife (2001);\u00a0God\u2019s Silence (2006);\u00a0Walking to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 2004;\u00a0Wheeling Motel (2009); Kindertotenwald (2011);\u00a0and F\u00a0(2013). In his precisely crafted, lyrical poems, Wright addresses the subjects of isolation, illness, spirituality, and gratitude. Of his work, he has commented, \u201cI think ideally, I would like, in a poem, to operate by way of suggestion.\u201d\n\r\nCritic Helen Vendler wrote in the New York Review of Books, \u201cWright's scale of experience, like Berryman's, runs from the homicidal to the ecstatic ... His best forms of or originality: deftness in patterning, startling metaphors, starkness of speech, compression of both pain and joy, and a stoic self-possession with the agonies and penalties of existence.\u201d Langdon Hammer, in the New York Times Book Review, wrote of God\u2019s Silence: \u201cIn his best poems, Wright grasps at the \u2018radiantly obvious thing\u2019 in short-lined short lyrics that turn and twist down the page. The urgency and calculated unsteadiness of the utterances, with their abrupt shifts of direction, jump-cuts and quips, mime the wounded openness of a speaker struggling to find faith.\u201d\u00a0\nWright\u00a0received a Whiting Fellowship, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. He translated poetry by\u00a0Rainer Maria Rilke\u00a0and Rene Char; in 2008 he and his wife, Elizabeth Oehlkers Wright, co-translated a collection by the Belarusian poet\u00a0Valzhyna Mort,\u00a0Factory of Tears.\u00a0He taught at Emerson College and other universities, worked in mental health clinics, and volunteered at a center for grieving children. His father was the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning poet\u00a0James Wright.\u00a0He died in 2015.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
