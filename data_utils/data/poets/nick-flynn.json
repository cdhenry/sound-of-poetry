His debut poetry collection, Some Ether (2000), won the PEN/Joyce Osterweil Award, for which the judges\u2019 statement read: \u201cThese poems establish their emotional authority through their very movement\u2014their wayward, whispering music. At once reckless and demure, outrageous and delicate. . . .\u201d Most of the poems in Some Ether focus on Flynn\u2019s tumultuous family life and include a detached yet affecting look at childhood and trauma. Having written about his family in both poetry and prose, Flynn has said, \u201cThe way I write I don\u2019t see much distinction between the two, although prose seems more suited to daylight, and poetry to night. I try to cook both down to something essential\u2014by the end hopefully some balance between mystery and clarity remains.\u201d\n\r\nFlynn is also the author of the books of poetry Blind Huber (2002),\u00a0The Captain Asks for a Show of Hands\u00a0(2011), and My Feelings (2015). He has also written\u00a0several memoirs, including\u00a0Another Bullshit Night in Suck City (2004), Being Flynn (2005),\u00a0The Ticking is the Bomb (2010), and The Reenactments (2013); and the play\u00a0Alice Invents a Little Game and Alice Always Wins\u00a0(2008).\u00a0His book\u00a0The Ticking Is the Bomb: A Memoir of Bewilderment\u00a0(2010) addresses the Abu Ghraib scandal.\u00a0\n\r\nFlynn teaches creative writing at the University of Houston, and splits his time between Houston and Brooklyn, New York.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
