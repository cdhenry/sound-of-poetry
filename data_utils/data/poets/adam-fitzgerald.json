About his work, David Kirby in the New York Times Sunday Book Review has written: \u201chis poems are drunk on both word and allusion and are therefore doubly tipsy \u2026 The result is a poetry as lush as any of Keats\u2019s odes, as textured as a corridor in the Louvre.\u201d His poems, essays and interviews have appeared in the New Yorker, Poetry, Boston Review, Granta, the New Republic,\u00a0and elsewhere.\n\r\nFitzgerald teaches creative writing and literature at Rutgers University and New York University, and previously at Columbia University and The New School.\u00a0In 2014, with poets Timothy Donnelly and Dorothea Lasky he founded\u00a0The Ashbery Home School,\u00a0a biannual poetry and arts conference for students of all ages.\u00a0He lives in the East Village in Manhattan.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
