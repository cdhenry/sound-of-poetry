A major poet, Hughes also wrote novels, short stories, essays, and plays. He\u00a0sought to honestly portray the joys and hardships of working-class black lives, avoiding both sentimental idealization and negative stereotypes. As he wrote in his essay \u201cThe Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain,\u201d \u201cWe younger Negro artists who create now intend to express our individual dark-skinned selves without fear or shame. If white people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, it doesn\u2019t matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly too.\u201d\nThis approach was not without its critics. Much of Hughes\u2019s early work was roundly criticized by many black intellectuals for portraying what they thought to be an unattractive view of black life. In his autobiographical\u00a0The Big Sea,\u00a0Hughes commented:\nFine Clothes to the Jew [Hughes\u2019s second book] was well received by the literary magazines and the white press, but the Negro critics did not like it at all. The Pittsburgh Courier ran a big headline across the top of the page, LANGSTON HUGHES\u2019 BOOK OF POEMS TRASH. The headline in the New York Amsterdam News was LANGSTON HUGHES THE SEWER DWELLER. The Chicago Whip characterized me as \u2018the poet low- rate of Harlem.\u2019 Others called the book a disgrace to the race, a return to the dialect tradition, and a parading of all our racial defects before the public. \u2026 The Negro critics and many of the intellectuals were very sensitive about their race in books. (And still are.) In anything that white people were likely to read, they wanted to put their best foot forward, their politely polished and cultural foot\u2014and only that foot.\nIn fact, the title\u00a0Fine Clothes to the Jew,\u00a0which was misunderstood and disliked by many people, was derived from the Harlemites Hughes saw pawning their own clothing; most of the pawn shops and other stores in Harlem at that time were owned by Jewish people. Lindsay Patterson, a novelist who served as Hughes\u2019s assistant, believed that Hughes was\ncritically, the most abused poet in America. \u2026 \u00a0Serious white critics ignored him, less serious ones compared his poetry to Cassius Clay doggerel, and most black critics only grudgingly admired him. Some, like James Baldwin, were downright malicious about his poetic achievement. But long after Baldwin and the rest of us are gone, I suspect Hughes\u2019 poetry will be blatantly around growing in stature until it is recognized for its genius. Hughes \u2026 was unashamedly black at a time when blackness was d\u00e9mod\u00e9. He had the wit and intelligence to explore the black human condition in a variety of depths, but his tastes and selectivity were not always accurate, and pressures to survive as a black writer in a white society (and it was a miracle that he did for so long) extracted an enormous creative toll.\nNevertheless, Hughes, more than any other black poet or writer, recorded faithfully the nuances of black life and its frustrations.\r\nIn Hughes\u2019s own words, his poetry is about\u00a0\"workers, roustabouts, and singers, and job hunters on Lenox Avenue in New York, or Seventh Street in\u00a0Washington or South State in Chicago\u2014people up today and down tomorrow, working this week and fired the next, beaten and baffled, but determined not to be wholly beaten, buying furniture on the installment plan, filling the house with roomers to help pay the rent,\u00a0hoping to get a new suit for Easter\u2014and pawning that suit before the Fourth of July.\"\nHoyt W. Fuller commented that Hughes \"chose to identify with plain black people\u00a0\u2026 precisely because he saw more truth and profound significance in doing so. Perhaps in this he was inversely influenced by his father\u2014who, frustrated by being the object of scorn in his native land, rejected his own people. Perhaps the poet\u2019s reaction to his father\u2019s flight from the American\u00a0racial reality drove him to embrace it with extra fervor.\u201d (Langston Hughes\u2019s parents separated shortly after his birth and his father moved to Mexico. The elder Hughes came to feel a deep dislike and revulsion for other African-Americans.)\nAlthough Hughes had trouble with both black and white critics, he was the first black American to earn his living solely from his writing and public lectures. Part of the reason he was able to do this was the phenomenal acceptance and love he received from average black people. A reviewer for\u00a0Black World\u00a0noted in 1970: \"Those whose prerogative it is to determine the rank of writers have never rated him highly, but if the weight of public response is any gauge then Langston Hughes stands at the apex of literary relevance among Black\u00a0 people. The poet occupies such a position in the memory of his people precisely because he recognized that \u2018we possess within ourselves a great reservoir of physical and spiritual strength,\u2019 and because he used his artistry to reflect this back to the people.\"\n\r\nHughes brought a varied and colorful background to his writing. Before he was 12 years old he had lived in six different American cities. When his first book was published, he had already been a truck farmer, cook, waiter, college graduate, sailor, and doorman at a nightclub in Paris, and had visited Mexico, West Africa, the Azores, the Canary Islands, Holland, France, and Italy. As David Littlejohn observed in his\u00a0Black on White: A Critical Survey of Writing by American Negroes:\u00a0\"On the whole, Hughes\u2019 creative life [was] as full, as varied, and as original as Picasso\u2019s, a joyful, honest\u00a0 monument of a career. There [was] no noticeable sham in it, no pretension, no self-deceit; but a great, great deal of delight and smiling irresistible wit. If he seems for the moment upstaged by angrier men, by more complex\u00a0 artists, if \u2018different views engage\u2019 us, necessarily, at this\u00a0trying stage of the race war, he may well outlive them all, and still be there when it\u2019s over. \u2026 Hughes\u2019\u00a0[greatness] seems to derive from his anonymous unity with his people. He\u00a0seems\u00a0to speak for millions, which is a tricky thing to do.\n\r\nHughes reached many people through his popular fictional character, Jesse B. Semple (shortened to Simple). Simple is a poor man who lives in Harlem, a kind of comic no-good, a stereotype Hughes turned to advantage. He tells his stories to Boyd, the foil in the stories who is a writer much like Hughes, in return for a drink. His tales of his troubles with work, women, money, and life in general often reveal, through their very simplicity, the problems of being a poor black man in a racist society. \u201cWhite folks,\u201d Simple once commented, \u201cis the cause of a lot of inconvenience in my life.\u201d Simple\u2019s musings first appeared in 1942 in \u201cFrom Here to Yonder,\u201d a column Hughes wrote for the\u00a0Chicago Defender\u00a0and later for the\u00a0New York Post.\u00a0According to a reviewer for\u00a0Kirkus Reviews,\u00a0their original intent was \u201cto convince black Americans to support the U.S. war effort.\u201d They were later published in several volumes.\n\r\nA more recent collection, 1994\u2019s\u00a0The Return of Simple,\u00a0contains previously unpublished material but remains current in its themes, according to a\u00a0Publishers Weekly\u00a0critic who noted Simple\u2019s addressing of such issues as political correctness, children\u2019s rights, and the racist undercurrent behind contraception and sterilization proposals. Donald C. Dickinson wrote in his\u00a0Bio-Bibliography of Langston Hughes\u00a0that \"[the] charm of Simple lies in his uninhibited pursuit of those two universal goals, understanding and security.\u00a0As with most other humans, he usually fails to achieve\u00a0either of these goals and sometimes once achieved they disappoint him. \u2026 Simple has a tough resilience, however, that won\u2019t allow him to brood over a failure very long. \u2026 Simple is a well-developed character, both believable and lovable. The situations he meets and discusses are so true to life everyone may enter the fun.\"\n\u00a0A reviewer for\u00a0Black World commented on the popularity of Simple: \u201cThe people responded. Simple lived in a world they knew, suffered their pangs, experienced their joys, reasoned in their way, talked their talk, dreamed their dreams, laughed their laughs, voiced their fears\u2014and all the while underneath, he affirmed the wisdom which anchored at the base of their lives.\u201d Hoyt W. Fuller believed that, like Simple, \"the key to Langston Hughes \u2026 was the poet\u2019s deceptive and\u00a0profound\u00a0simplicity. Profound because it was both\u00a0 willed and ineffable, because some intuitive sense even at the beginning of his adulthood taught him that\u00a0humanity was of the essence and that it existed undiminished in all shapes, sizes, colors and conditions. Violations of that humanity offended his unshakable conviction that mankind is possessed of the divinity of God.\"\n\r\nIt was Hughes\u2019s belief in humanity and his hope for a world in which people could sanely and with understanding live together that led to his decline in popularity in the racially turbulent latter years of his life. Unlike younger and more militant writers, Hughes never lost his conviction that \u201cmost\u00a0people are generally good, in every race and in every country where I have been.\u201d Reviewing\u00a0The Panther and the Lash: Poems of Our Times\u00a0in\u00a0Poetry,\u00a0Laurence Lieberman recognized that Hughes\u2019s \u201csensibility [had] kept pace with the times,\u201d but he criticized his lack of a personal political stance. \u201cRegrettably, in different poems, he is fatally prone to sympathize with starkly antithetical politics of race,\u201d Lieberman commented. \u201cA reader can appreciate his catholicity, his tolerance of all the rival\u2014and mutually hostile\u2014views of his outspoken compatriots, from Martin Luther King to Stokely Carmichael, but we are tempted to ask, what are Hughes\u2019 politics? And if he has none, why not? The age demands intellectual commitment from its spokesmen. A poetry whose chief claim on our attention is moral, rather than aesthetic, must take sides politically.\u201d\n\r\nHughes\u2019s position in the American literary scene seems to be secure. David Littlejohn wrote that Hughes is \"the one sure Negro classic, more certain of permanence than even Baldwin or Ellison or Wright. \u2026 His voice is as sure, his manner as original, his position as secure as, say\u00a0Edwin Arlington Robinson\u2019s or\u00a0Robinson Jeffers\u2019. \u2026\u00a0By molding his verse always on the sounds of Negro talk, the rhythms of Negro music, by retaining his own keen honesty and directness, his poetic sense and ironic intelligence, he maintained through four decades a readable newness distinctly his own.\"\nThe Block\u00a0and\u00a0The Sweet and Sour Animal Book\u00a0are posthumously published collections of Hughes\u2019s poetry for children that position his words against a backdrop of visual art.\u00a0The Block\u00a0pairs Hughes\u2019s poems with a series of six collages by Romare Bearden that bear the book\u2019s title.\u00a0The Sweet and Sour Animal Book\u00a0contains previously unpublished and repeatedly rejected poetry of Hughes from the 1930s. Here, the editors have combined it with the artwork of elementary school children at the Harlem School of the Arts. The results, noted Veronica Chambers in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review,\u00a0\u201creflect Hughes\u2019s childlike wonder as well as his sense of humor.\u201d Chambers also commented on the rhythms of Hughes\u2019s words, noting that \u201cchildren love a good rhyme\u201d and that Hughes gave them \u201cjust a simple but seductive taste of the blues.\u201d Hughes\u2019s poems have been translated into German, French, Spanish, Russian, Yiddish, and Czech; many of them have been set to music.\n\r\nDonald B. Gibson noted in the introduction to\u00a0Modern Black Poets: A Collection of Critical Essays\u00a0that Hughes\nhas perhaps the greatest reputation (worldwide) that any black writer has ever had. Hughes differed from most of his predecessors among black poets, and (until recently) from those who followed him as well, in that he addressed his poetry to the people, specifically to black people. During the twenties when most American poets were turning inward, writing obscure and esoteric poetry to an ever decreasing audience of readers, Hughes was turning outward, using language and themes, attitudes and ideas familiar to anyone who had the ability simply to read. He has been, unlike most nonblack poets other than\u00a0Walt Whitman,\u00a0Vachel Lindsay, and\u00a0Carl Sandburg, a poet of the people. \u2026 \u00a0Until the time of his death, he spread his message humorously\u2014though always seriously\u2014to audiences throughout the country, having read his poetry to more people (possibly) than any other American poet.\nHughes died on May 22, 1967, due to complications from prostate cancer.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Harlem Renaissance"]}}
