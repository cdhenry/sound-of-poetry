As the author of numerous collections of poetry, Shapiro has explored family, loss, domesticity, and the daily aspects of people\u2019s lives in free verse and traditional poetic forms. He has\u00a0published over ten books of poetry, most recently Life Pig ;(2016);\u00a0Reel to Reel\u00a0(2014), a finalist for the Pulizer Prize;\u00a0Night of the Republic (2012), a finalist for the National Book Award and the Griffin Prize; and\u00a0Old War (2008), winner of the Ambassador Book Award.\u00a0\n\r\nPoet-critic J.D. McClatchy observed in a review of Shapiro\u2019s Dead, Alive and Busy (2000), \u201cMr. Shapiro is a shrewd and sympathetic moralist. He never trivializes his subjects with high-minded flourishes or stylistic gimmicks.\u201d Shapiro\u2019s later collections address the loss of his two siblings to cancer, the aging of his parents, and the strains on a marriage. In describing the domestic details and loss portrayed in Shapiro\u2019s Tantalus in Love (2005), poet Joshua Clover commented, \u201cSuch tightly framed tales of domesticity offer a sense of control parallel to Shapiro\u2019s formal facility, reducing and clarifying the poem\u2019s field of action in defense against an abysmal multiplicity of things.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nIn his memoirs The Last Happy Occasion (1997), nominated for a National Book Critics Circle award, and Vigil (1997), Shapiro has written about the death of his sister and the role that poetry has played in his life. Shapiro is also the author of a collection of essays on poetry, In Praise of the Impure: Poetry and the Ethical Imagination: Essays, 1980\u20131991 (1993).\n\r\nAlan Shapiro has won the Kingsley Tufts Award, the Los Angeles Book Prize, and a Lila Wallace\u2013Reader\u2019s Digest Writers\u2019 Award. During Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, Shapiro was invited to read his work at the White House. He read \u201cOn Men Weeping,\u201d a poem about Michael Jordan winning one of his six NBA championships. Shapiro has taught at Stanford University, Northwestern University, and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\n\n\n\nPOETRY\nAfter the Digging. Chicago: Elpenor Books, 1981.\nThe Courtesy.
