His father, editor and novelist Peter George Patmore, educated his son, sent him to Paris when he was 16, and encouraged him to publish his first book, Poems (1844). Coventry Patmore\u2019s subsequent collections of poetry include Tamerton Church Tower (1853) and The Angel in the House\u2014composed of four volumes: The Betrothal (1854), The Espousals (1856), Faithful for Ever (1860), and The Victories of Love (1863). \u00a0 Patmore worked at the British Museum from 1846 to 1865 and was associated with the Pre-Raphaelites. His acquaintances included William Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Alice Meynell, and John Ruskin, and his portrait was painted by John Singer Sargent. Patmore also wrote essays on art, including the collections Principles in Art (1889) and Religio Poetae (1893). \u00a0 The Angel in the House presented a portrait of married life that became a Victorian ideal of domestic bliss. The work was inspired by Patmore\u2019s first wife, Emily Augusta Andrews. Andrews was an author of children\u2019s stories and the mother of six of Patmore\u2019s children. They were married from 1847 until her death in 1860. \u00a0 Patmore traveled to Rome and converted to Roman Catholicism in 1864. After Emily Patmore\u2019s death, he was married to Marianne Caroline Byles from 1864 until her death in 1880. In 1865 he left the British Museum to manage his estate, Heron\u2019s Ghyll, in Sussex. Patmore\u2019s third wife was Harriet Robson, his children\u2019s governess. \n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Victorian"]}}
