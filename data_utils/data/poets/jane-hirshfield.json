Hirshfield is also the author of two collections of essays, Nine Gates: Entering the Mind of Poetry (1997) and Ten Windows: How Great Poems Transform the World (2015), and has edited and co-translated four books collecting the work of world poets from the past: The Ink Dark Moon: Poems by Ono no Komachi and Izumi Shikibu, Women of the Ancient Court of Japan\u00a0(1990); Women in Praise of the Sacred: Forty-Three Centuries of Spiritual Poetry by Women\u00a0(1994); Mirabai: Ecstatic Poems (2004); and The Heart of Haiku (2011).\u00a0\nHirshfield\u2019s work encompasses a large range of influences, drawing from the sciences as well as the world\u2019s literary, intellectual, artistic, and spiritual traditions. Her first poem appeared in The Nation in 1973, winning what would the next year become the Discovery Award, shortly after she graduated from Princeton as a member of the university\u2019s first graduating class to include women. She then put aside her writing for nearly eight years to study at the San Francisco Zen Center. \u201cI felt that I\u2019d never make much of a poet if I didn\u2019t know more than I knew at that time about what it means to be a human being,\u201d Hirshfield once said. \u201cI don\u2019t think poetry is based just on poetry; it is based on a thoroughly lived life.\u201d\nHirshfield\u2019s poems hinge on a turning point or moment of insight. Her early work, including\u00a0Of Gravity & Angels\u00a0(1988), focused intently on natural settings, the personal, and eros. By\u00a0The October Palace\u00a0(1994), she was exploring the themes for which she would become well known: awareness, consciousness, and an engagement with the vicissitudes of both the world\u2019s outer events and more interior realms. Poet Rosanna Warren praised Hirshfield\u2019s poems for their \u201cethical awareness\u201d and language that \u201cin its cleanliness and transparency, poses riddles of a quietly metaphysical nature\u201d while Nobel Laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz wrote of Hirshfield\u2019s \u201cprofound empathy for the suffering of all living beings.\u201d Hirshfield\u2019s ability to marry philosophical meditation with domestic observation has been widely remarked upon. In the\u00a0Georgia Review,\u00a0Judith Kitchen\u00a0said of\u00a0Given Sugar, Given Salt: \u201cIt\u2019s about how to negotiate the difficulties of living while, at the same time, paying homage to what life has to offer. The poems are penetrating; they reveal a quick intelligence and an even quicker intuition.\u201d Hirshfield\u2019s intuition is matched by the formal assurance of her craft.\u00a0Publisher\u2019s Weekly\u00a0described the world found in her poems as \u201callegorical scenes like bare stage sets,\u201d noting that Hirshfield manages to \u201cintroduce elegant observations in conversational free verse, in words drawn from common American speech.\u201d Steven Ratiner, naming her \u201camong the modern masters\u201d in a Washington Post review of Come, Thief, praised Hirshfield\u2019s frequent use of minimalist techniques: \u201cThe mind is allowed to wrestle with what\u2019s unseen, unsaid.\u201d In a\u00a0Booklist starred review, Donna Seaman praised Hirshfield's \"meticulous reasoning, including a striking meditation on the paradoxical richness of spareness that can serve as her ars poetica.\" \u00a0\u201cAstonishing strophes of being,\u201d wrote Robert Bonazzi of The Beauty, in World Literature Today; \u201cJane Hirshfield stands with the finest contemporary American poets. The Beauty reveals a poetics of being that inhabits mysteries, essences, and beautiful lyrics. In her books of prizewinning poetry, translations, and essays, one realizes her works are apertures into wisdom.\"\nHirshfield\u2019s two books of essays touch upon such subjects as originality, the workings of metaphoric mind, translation, the oral roots of poetry, poetry\u2019s finding of resilience amidst suffering, surprise, uncertainty, and paradox.\u00a0\u201cWith her feet firmly planted in both the Western and Eastern canons, Hirshfield delivers a thorough and timely collection on our relationships to poetry, our relationship to the world, and everything in between,\u201d stated a\u00a0starred Publishers Weekly\u00a0reviewer in praise of\u00a0Nine Gates.\u00a0\u00a0A starred review in Booklist said of Ten Windows, \u201cIn 20 or 30 years, this book may be remembered as one of the great common-readers on the pleasures of poetry.\u201d\nIn recent decades, Hirshfield has become increasingly known as a poet working at the intersection of poetry, the sciences, and the crisis of the biosphere. She has been poet in residence at both the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in Oregon and a neuroscience research program at UCSF. In 2017, in conjunction with the March for Science in Washington DC, she founded Poets for Science, an interactive exhibit of science poems and writing invitation housed at Kent State\u2019s Wick Poetry Center, which has traveled to venues across the country.\nHirshfield has been a visiting poet at Stanford University and UC-Berkeley, and served on the faculty of Bennington\u2019s MFA Writing Seminars. Her many awards include fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Guggenheim Foundation. Other honors include the Poetry Center Book Award, Columbia University\u2019s Translation Center Award, the Bay Area Book Reviewer\u2019s Award, the California Book Award, and the Hall-Kenyon Award, as well as ten selections in The Best American Poetry. In 2004, Hirshfield received the Academy Fellowship from the Academy of American Poets and in 2012, she was elected a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. In 2019, Hirshfield was inducted into the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.\n\r\nHirshfield once told\u00a0Contemporary Authors:\u00a0\u201cPoetry, for me, is an instrument of investigation and a mode of perception, a way of knowing and feeling both self and world\u2026I am interested in poems that find a clarity without simplicity; in a way of thinking and speaking that does not exclude complexity but also does not obscure; in poems that know the world in many ways at once\u2014heart, mind, voice, and body.\u201d\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
