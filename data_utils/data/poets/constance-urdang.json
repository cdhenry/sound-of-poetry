She earned a BA from Smith College and an MFA from the University of Iowa. She taught at Washington University in St. Louis, and with her husband, the poet Donald Finkel, she helped found the graduate writers program there in the 1970s. Urdang is the author of the poetry collections\u00a0Only the World (1983), The Lone Woman and Others (1980), The Picnic in the Cemetery (1975), and Charades and Celebrations (1965), among others. Her honors include the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Poetry Award and the Carleton Centennial Award for Prose. In 1976, she received a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts.\nUrdang\u2019s poem \u201cThe Moon Tree,\u201d from her first poetry collection, Charades and Celebrations, has been praised by Raymond Roseliep in a Poetry article as \u201cthe kind of thing Stephen Vincent Benet had in mind when he defined poetry as magic.\u201d Roseliep feels that another poem from this collection, \u201cThe Old Woman,\u201d is \u201cachievement of the same caliber \u2026 and so is \u2018In the Junkshop,\u2019 which proves that poems can be written about anything.\u201d Saturday Review critic W.T. Scott explains that \u201cby sheer force of style [Urdang] can make mythological figures out of aunts and grandparents, and she can deal with historical figures in exciting livelier ways than we usually get these days. She is a fine poet with a sardonic eye trained to real values.\u201d\nUrdang was a successful novelist, though Natural History is, according to its author as quoted in Saturday Review, \u201cNot a novel. A series of images in the form of prose episodes. Their meaning, if any, to emerge when at the end one can look back to try and make out the \u2018significant patterns.\u2019\u201d Muriel Haynes in that same Saturday Review article likens Natural History to a journal, or \u201cthought book,\u201d in which literally, though not in other regards, \u201cnothing happens; a succession of everyday people, men and women, old and young, dead and alive, move in and out, serving as metaphors for ways-of-being-in-the-world.\u201d These everyday people who represent \u201cways-of-being-in-the-world\u201d include the narrator, her family, and three of her female friends, and emphasis is placed on the age-old concerns of \u201ctime, birth, generation, old age, love, [and] death,\u201d as defined by New York Times Book Review critic Jay Neugeboren. Neugeboren believes, despite Urdang\u2019s \u201canti-fiction pattern,\u201d that Natural History \u201cseems quite old-fashioned. \u2026 [Its] concerns remain fundamental, traditional.\u201d And he adds that \u201cin spite of the book\u2019s fragmented surface, in spite of its disclaimers (\u2018Not a novel \u2026 \u2019), it becomes, due to its sure and singular voice, a coherent, evocative and real object in its own right.\u201d Whereas a contributor to the Virginia Quarterly Review says Urdang\u2019s structural strategy in Natural History fails, the same contributor praises the book\u2019s narrative for its \u201chonest, moving, and intelligent questioning of what a woman\u2019s role is, and can be, in our society. [It] \u2026 has the fascination of a brilliant journal.\u201d As for Haynes, she believes \u201cthe effect of Natural History is a bit like that of a speculative talk with a sharp-minded friend of fine sensibility. There is a similar intimate ease\u00a0\u2026 there is intellectual exhilaration.\u201d\n\r\nWith three poetry collections in between, Urdang followed her first novel, Natural History (1969), with a novella entitled Lucha (1986). Courtney Weaver writes in the San Francisco Chronicle that Lucha is a \u201cliterary mural of three generations of Mexican women which, despite its brevity, sacrifices neither beauty nor relevance.\u201d This mural paints the life history of Luz Filomena whose nickname, \u201cLucha,\u201d means to \u201cstruggle.\u201d Weaver focuses on the contrast Urdang develops between Lucha, a believer in urbanization and the idea of progress for women and for Mexico, and her niece, Nieves, a woman content to be mother and housekeeper. Lucha is, writes Weaver, \u201ccontinually trying, continually struggling toward a new ideal of femininity and of herself.\u201d New York Times Book Review commentator Susan Wood judges that \u201cin this spare, often elegant tale \u2026 Urdang obviously knows Mexico and she writes about the country and its people with feeling and understanding. But \u2026 one feels something is curiously missing.\u201d Weaver, in turn, says Lucha, \u201clike an effective painting, \u2026 may be praised for its capture of time and character. \u2026 It is a novel not about struggling dialectics but rather about the interweaving of sorrow, fulfillment, beauty and change.\u201d\nUrdang died of complications from lung cancer on October 8, 1996.\n", "attrs": {}}
