In a New York Times review, Anatole Broyard noted, \u201cIt\u2019s as if, in writing it, she broke through the ordinary human condition with all its dissatisfactions, and achieved a kind of transfiguration.\u201d In a 2008 interview with the Paris Review, Robinson addressed spirituality, a recurring theme in her work: \u201cReligion is a framing mechanism. It is a language of orientation that presents itself as a series of questions. It talks about the arc of life and the quality of experience in ways that I\u2019ve found fruitful to think about.\u201d\nMother Country: Britain, the Welfare State and Nuclear Pollution (1989), her controversial nonfiction examination of the environmental impact of the British nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, was a finalist for the National Book Award. The Death of Adam: Essays on Modern Thought (1998) collects her rigorous reassessments of major figures in poetry, science, and history; as critic Roger Kimball observed in the New York Times, \u201cthe inadequacy of fact\u2014of brute fact, fact unredeemed by human meaning\u2014is a leitmotif in Robinson\u2019s thought.\u201d\nHer paired novels, Gilead (2004) and Home (2008), explore the intersections of two families in an Iowa town. Gilead won the 2005 Pulitzer Prize, and Home was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award.\nRobinson teaches at the University of Iowa. She lives in Iowa City, where she has served as a deacon for the Congregational United Church of Christ to which she belongs.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
