He added, \u201cWolsak in her poetry asks, what are we, and can we learn to feel ourselves assembling our perceived world? And, might we learn ways to assemble it differently, with greater mercy and justice?\u201d\nWolsak\u2019s books include lightsail (2018), Of Beings Alone (2015), Pen Chants: Or Nth or 12 Spirit-Like Impermanences (2000), and The Garcia Family Co-Mercy (1994), as well as the poetic essay An Heuristic Prolusion (2000). Critical essays on Wolsak\u2019s work appear in\u00a0The Poetic Front: The Lissa Wolsak Issue (2011) and\u00a0Antiphonies: Essays on Women\u2019s Experimental Poetries in Canada\u00a0(2008).\nShe lives in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n", "attrs": {}}
