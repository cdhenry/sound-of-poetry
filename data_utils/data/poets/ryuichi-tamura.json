He graduated from the Third Tokyo Commercial School before being drafted into the Japanese Navy in 1943. Following the war, he worked as an editor, helped revive the literary magazine The Waste Land, and gradually became an important figure in postwar Japanese poetry.\nTamura\u2019s poetry was known for its revelatory images and tonal control. Writing in the Independent in 1998, James Kirkup states that Tamura\u2019s poetry consistently contained \u201ca note of slight hysteria\u201d and was \u201calways on the edge of crisis, but touched with redeeming satirical humour.\u201d\n\u00a0After a long life in the arts, Tamura died in 1998, shortly after being awarded the Japan Academy of Arts Award for Poetry.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Asia, East"]}}
