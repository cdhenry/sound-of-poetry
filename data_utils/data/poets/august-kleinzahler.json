He grew up in Fort Lee, New Jersey and has been a longtime resident of San Francisco, California. His many poetry collections include The Hotel Oneira (2013); Sleeping It Off in Rapid City (2008), which was awarded the National Book Critics Circle Award; The Strange Hours Travelers Keep (2004), which won the Griffin Poetry Prize; Live from the Hong Kong Nile Club: Poems, 1975-1990; Green Sees Things in Waves (1999); and Red Sauce, Whiskey and Snow (1995). He has received an American Academy of Arts and Letters Literature Award, a Lannan Literary Award in Poetry, the Berlin Prize, and a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation. His prose is also regularly published in the London Review of Books and Slate.\nOften described a \u201cpugnacious\u201d and a \u201cpugilist poet,\u201d August Kleinzahler\u2019s reputation rests on his jazzy, formally inventive and energetic poetry, though he has also garnered notice as something of a bad-boy literary outsider prone to picking fights with the establishment. Kleinzahler\u2019s fame as a colloquial poet of \u201cdive bars, greasy soup, alcohol and old girlfriends,\u201d as John Glionna of the LA Times put it, has built steadily over the past several decades. His poetry\u2019s gruff language and fondness for off-color subject matter doesn\u2019t overshadow his formal control and innovation, however, and he is highly praised for his mastery of vocabulary, syntax, and line. Allen Ginsberg famously remarked that \u201cAugust Kleinzahler\u2019s verse line is always precise, concrete, intelligent and rare\u2014that quality of \u2018chiseled\u2019 verse memorable in Basil Bunting\u2019s and Ezra Pound\u2019s work. A loner, a genius.\u201d\nKleinzahler\u2019s early life in New Jersey was marked by an intense awareness of the mob;\u00a0Fort Lee was a notorious bedroom community for Albert Anastasia\u2019s Murder Inc. syndicate. In an interview with Kleinzahler for the Guardian, James Campbell noted that \u201cthe poet remains passionate about his New Jersey identity, sometimes referring to it as if it were a separate character, and about his home town in particular. His poems set in his native surroundings are free of bravado, touched instead by fondness that matures while its focus recedes into memory.\u201d As a young man, Kleinzahler was influenced by both Beat aesthetics and ethics, dropping out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison to hitchhike across the country and taking odd jobs along the road. His early books were published as broadsheets and chapbooks, mainly in Canada, where he attended the University of Victoria in British Columbia to study under the great English modernist Basil Bunting. Bunting and the poet Thom Gunn\u00a0both had a major influence on Kleinzahler\u2019s early work.\nKleinzahler\u2019s fourth book of poems, Red Sauce, Whiskey, and Snow (1995), was the first published by a trade press. A reviewer discussing the collection for the Economist said of the poems: \u201c[They] twitch and jerk and snap their fingers at you. ... High and low vocabularies hang out together. They are hectic, pulsing things, ever alive to the music of words when spoken.\u201d Bruce Murphy in Poetry described Kleinzahler\u2019s poems as \u201cplayful, like a stone dropped in a pool\u2014or maybe thrown. They aren\u2019t necessarily going anywhere, or they are rippling outward in every direction at once.\u201d For Murphy, Kleinzahler\u2019s influences included the Beats as well as \u201cjazz, Buddhism, urban landscapes, and street life.\u201d According to David Rivard, writing in Ploughshares, the poems in Red Sauce, Whiskey, and Snow accomplish \u201cone of the hardest things of all\u201d by combining \u201can impulse toward improvisatory speech with a terrific ear for clarified structures.\u201d Rivard set Kleinzahler apart from postmodern writers because \u201che\u2019s interested in rendering the feel of living into accessible speech.\u201d\nThe title poem in Kleinzahler\u2019s next volume, Green Sees Things in Waves (1998), deals with a man named Green who has taken too much LSD and continues to have flashbacks to a drugged state of consciousness. David Wojahn, writing in Poetry, observed that the poet \u201cfavors gallows humor \u2026 Yet if I wonder about the tone of the book\u2019s title poem, perhaps it\u2019s because no one quite sounds like August Kleinzahler, despite the fact that he wears his influences on his sleeve. The caffeinated momentum of his lines and his surprising associative vectors make for exhilarating reading, so much so that it\u2019s easy to forget how dark he can be.\u201d Reviewing the collection for the Boston Review, William Broaddus noted that there are \u201cfewer street folk in Green Sees Things in Waves, and more artists looking at streets, although it\u2019s hard ever to claim certainty about Kleinzahler\u2019s point of view.\u201d For Broaddus, that uncertainty of perception is coupled with Kleinzahler\u2019s formal awareness, so that his \u201cmodel [is] of an art that captures life while it happens, but also reminds us there is someone around and behind the lens, choosing and arranging the shots.\u201d Broaddus concluded that Kleinzahler\u2019s poems \u201cstage a process in which sense turns into nonsense and back again, depending on how we use our senses, or perceive a word. Just as often, in this book, that process is caught and released, so we can examine, and not only experience, its workings.\u201d\nThe Strange Hours Travelers Keep (2004) was unanimously praised. The book presents a \u201cfrenetic and wily collection\u201d of poems from a poet fascinated with what thinking humans build and concoct to \u201ckeep themselves busy and dizzy and safe from sorrow\u2019s dark draw,\u201d remarked Donna Seaman in Booklist. Maureen McLane in the New York Times wondered if Kleinzahler \u201cmight be considered a postmodern metaphysical poet,\u201d for his interest in conceits \u201cdeftly played out.\u201d But more than metaphysics, McLane noted Kleinzahler\u2019s interest in media, music and noise in the collection: \u201cHis work often seizes upon art\u2019s techne, its means of production, and the soulful aspirations conveyed in them: he takes for granted our 21st-century cyber-situation, and his poems invoke the impact of dreams, computers, movies, jazz, detective novels, pop songs, ads, headlines, billboards \u2026 [yet] this poet aspires to something more permanent than fleeting tones but less marmoreal than self-monumentalizing poetry. His poems ring many changes, delicate and precise, on what is \u2018fugitive\u2019 (a recurring word here), even as his ears remain preternaturally open to the America of attack jets, talk radio and holiday gatherings \u2018with the TV going all the while.\u2019\u201d\nKleinzahler\u2019s prose memoir, Cutty, One Rock (2004), explores his childhood in 1950s Fort Lee, New Jersey, where the mafia was everywhere and Jews were scarce among the area\u2019s many Italians. In these \u201cwry, off-kilter essays,\u201d he writes about the images and events that defined his youth and which set him on the track to becoming a poet, noted Entertainment Weekly reviewer Jennifer Reese. The youngest of three children, and an unexpected baby, Kleinzahler grew up with a father whose moods were unpredictable and whose mother did not like children\u2014even her own. He describes the sights, sounds, and smells of his early home, of the constant din of subway trains, the inescapable presence of other people. He looks back almost affectionately at the gangsters, members of Albert Anastasia\u2019s Murder Inc., who were constant presences in his life, and one mobster in particular whom he considered the best babysitter he ever had. But the memoir is haunted by Kleinzahler\u2019s older brother, a financial analyst who lived a double life as a gangster and gambler, and who took his own life at age 27. The stories related in the book are \u201chigh and low, crushing and comic, indelible as India ink,\u201d observed a Kirkus Reviews contributor. \u201cKleinzahler\u2019s unsparing essays glow with the threat and promise of the neon signs of all-night dives,\u201d commented Donna Seaman in Booklist.\nSleeping it Off in Rapid City (2008) was hailed by critics as a major achievement. Collecting poems from his earlier collections, as well as presenting new work, the volume included the tour-de-force \u201cRetard Spoilage\u201d which turns the rotting contents of a refrigerator into a meditation on love. The poem also showed off Kleinzahler\u2019s ability to use a semi-specialized vocabulary to spectacular effect. Stephen Burt in the New York Times Book Review noted that the volume \u201cshows continuities along with the ways in which the poet has changed.\u201d From tough-guy personae to weary world-travelers, Burt found that Kleinzahler succeeds in trying \u201cto sound tough, or masculine, or self-conscious about manhood\u201d where other poets \u201cfail miserably\u201d because of \u201cHis eye, and his ear\u2014he is, first and last, a craftsman, a maker of lines\u2014but also his range of tones, and his self-restraint: he never says more than he should, rarely repeats himself and keeps his focus not on the man who speaks the poems (and whose personality comes across anyway) but on what that man sees and on what he can hear.\u201d\nDescribing his own style in a Paris Review interview, Kleinzahler said, \u201cI don\u2019t think of such a thing as my style, and prefer not to. But one thing I\u2019ve been made to realize about my poetry that is perhaps a bit different is that I continually change registers, which is more common in musical composition than poetry, and my models are musical, i.e. Bart\u00f3k\u2019s late string quartets. I suppose Mingus, in jazz, would also be a model of sorts, but less complex and interesting than Bart\u00f3k, I think. Not that I can match their complexity. But I think this changing of register confuses readers who are more comfortable deciding at the top if this is a nice poem, or a pretty poem, or a sad poem, or an angry poem, whatever, and don\u2019t like the tablecloth to be pulled out from under them just as they\u2019re halfway through their Stroganoff.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
