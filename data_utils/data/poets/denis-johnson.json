He grew up in the Philippines, Japan, and Washington DC, and earned an MFA from the University of Iowa's Writers' Workshop. At one time addicted to drugs and alcohol, Johnson\u2019s literary output increased significantly after he became sober. In 1973 he was homeless in Berkeley, California, an experience he recounted in a New Yorker essay \u201cHomeless and High.\u201d Few writers have been so highly regarded\u2014in all genres he worked in\u2014by critics, readers, and fellow writers. He told the Los Angeles Times in 2014, \u201cI get bored quickly and try another style, another genre, another form. ... To me the writing is all one thing, or maybe I should say it's all nothing. The truth is, I just write sentences.\u201d\n\r\nJohnson published his first collection of poems, The Man Among the Seals (1969), at the age of 20. Subsequent collections include Inner Weather (1976), The Incognito Lounge and Other Poems (1982), and The Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations Millennium General Assembly: Poems Collected and New (1995). His poems often depict characters on the margins of society. Reviewing\u00a0The Incognito Lounge and Other Poems in the New York Times Book Review, Alan Williamson wrote,\u00a0 \u201c[Johnson] convinces me that he suffers over the anomie he describes. He is hard on himself, as well as on the culture; and he is agonizingly aware that life can be, and has been, different from the life around him ... he knows how to use his eyes.\u201d On his poetic influences, Johnson stated, \u201cMy ear for the diction and rhythms of poetry was trained by\u2014in chronological order\u2014Dr. Seuss, Dylan Thomas, Walt Whitman, the guitar solos of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix, and T.S. Eliot. Other influences come and go, but those I admire the most and those I admired the earliest (I still admire them) have something to say in every line I write.\u201d\n\r\nJohnson is the author of numerous novels, including Fiskadoro (1985), Nobody Move (2009), and Tree of Smoke, a novel about covert operations in the Vietnam War, won the 2007 National Book Award. Jesus\u2019 Son (1992), his collection of short stories that focus on the lives of drug addicts, was made into a film of the same name in 1999. He received a Lannan Literary Award for Fiction and a Whiting Writer\u2019s Award.\n\r\nJohnson died in 2017.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
