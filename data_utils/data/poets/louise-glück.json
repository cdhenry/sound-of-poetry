She attended Sarah Lawrence College and Columbia University. Considered by many to be one of America\u2019s most talented contemporary poets, Gl\u00fcck is known for her poetry\u2019s technical precision, sensitivity, and insight into loneliness, family relationships, divorce, and death. The poet Robert Hass has called her \u201cone of the purest and most accomplished lyric poets now writing.\u201d In 2020 she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for her unmistakable poetic voice that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal.\"\nGl\u00fcck is the author of 12 books of poetry, including the recent collections Faithful and Virtuous Night (2014), winner of the National Book Award, and Poems 1962-2012 (2012), which won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, as well as the essay collection American Originality (2017). Gl\u00fcck\u2019s early books feature personae grappling with the aftermaths of failed love affairs, disastrous family encounters, and existential despair, and her later work continues to explore the agony of the self. Her first book of poetry, Firstborn (1968), was recognized for its technical control as well as its collection of disaffected, isolated narratives. Helen Vendler commented on Gl\u00fcck\u2019s use of story in her New Republic review of The House on Marshland (1975). \u201cGl\u00fcck\u2019s cryptic narratives invite our participation: we must, according to the case, fill out the story, substitute ourselves for the fictive personages, invent a scenario from which the speaker can utter her lines, decode the import, \u2018solve\u2019 the allegory,\u201d Vendler maintained. But she added that \u201clater, I think \u2026 we read the poem, instead, as a truth complete within its own terms, reflecting some one of the innumerable configurations into which experience falls.\u201d According to poet-critic Rosanna Warren, Gl\u00fcck\u2019s \u201cpower [is] to distance the lyric \u2018I\u2019 as subject and object of attention\u201d and to \u201cimpose a discipline of detachment upon urgently subjective material.\u201d\n\r\nGl\u00fcck\u2019s poems in books such as Firstborn, The House on Marshland, The Garden (1976), Descending Figure (1980), The Triumph of Achilles (1985), Ararat (1990), and the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Wild Iris (1992) take readers on an inner journey by exploring their deepest, most intimate feelings. Gl\u00fcck\u2019s ability to create poetry that many people can understand, relate to, and experience intensely and completely stems from her deceptively straightforward language and poetic voice. In a review of Gl\u00fcck\u2019s The Triumph of Achilles, Wendy Lesser noted in the Washington Post Book World that \u201c\u2018direct\u2019 is the operative word here: Gl\u00fcck\u2019s language is staunchly straightforward, remarkably close to the diction of ordinary speech. Yet her careful selection for rhythm and repetition, and the specificity of even her idiomatically vague phrases, give her poems a weight that is far from colloquial.\u201d Lesser went on to remark that \u201cthe strength of that voice derives in large part from its self-centeredness\u2014literally, for the words in Gl\u00fcck\u2019s poems seem to come directly from the center of herself.\u201d\n\r\nBecause Gl\u00fcck writes so effectively about disappointment, rejection, loss, and isolation, reviewers frequently refer to her poetry as \u201cbleak\u201d or \u201cdark.\u201d The Nation\u2019s Don Bogen felt that Gl\u00fcck\u2019s \u201cbasic concerns\u201d were \u201cbetrayal, mortality, love and the sense of loss that accompanies it\u2026 She is at heart the poet of a fallen world.\u201d Stephen Burt, reviewing her collection Averno (2006), noted that \u201cfew poets save [Sylvia] Plath have sounded so alienated, so depressed, so often, and rendered that alienation aesthetically interesting.\u201d Readers and reviewers have also marveled at Gl\u00fcck\u2019s gift for creating poetry with a dreamlike quality that at the same time deals with the realities of passionate and emotional subjects. Holly Prado declared in a Los Angeles Times Book Review piece on The Triumph of Achilles (1985) that Gl\u00fcck\u2019s poetry works \u201cbecause she has an unmistakable voice that resonates and brings into our contemporary world the old notion that poetry and the visionary are intertwined.\u201d Gl\u00fcck\u2019s Pulitzer prize-winning collection, The Wild Iris (1992), clearly demonstrates her visionary poetics. The book, written in three segments, is set in a garden and imagines three voices: flowers speaking to the gardener-poet, the gardener-poet, and an omniscient god figure. In the New Republic, Helen Vendler described how \u201cGl\u00fcck\u2019s language revived the possibilities of high assertion, assertion as from the Delphic tripod. The words of the assertions, though, were often humble, plain, usual; it was their hierarchic and unearthly tone that distinguished them. It was not a voice of social prophecy but of spiritual prophecy\u2014a tone that not many women had the courage to claim.\n\nMeadowlands (1996), Gl\u00fcck\u2019s first new work after The Wild Iris, takes its impetus from Greek and Roman mythology. The book uses the voices of Odysseus and Penelope to create \u201ca kind of high-low rhetorical experiment in marriage studies,\u201d according to Deborah Garrison in the New York Times Book Review. Garrison added that, through the \u201csuburban banter\u201d between the ancient wanderer and his wife, Meadowlands \u201ccaptures the way that a marriage itself has a tone, a set of shared vocal grooves inseparable from the particular personalities involved and the partial truces they\u2019ve made along the way.\u201d\n\nVita Nova (1999) earned Gl\u00fcck the prestigious Bollingen Prize from Yale University. In an interview with Brian Phillips of the Harvard Advocate, Gl\u00fcck stated: \u201cThis book was written very, very rapidly\u2026 Once it started, I thought, this is a roll, and if it means you\u2019re not going to sleep, okay, you\u2019re not going to sleep.\u201d Although the ostensible subject matter of the collection is the examination of the aftermath of a broken marriage, Vita Nova is suffused with symbols drawn from both personal dreams and classic mythological archetypes. Gl\u00fcck\u2019s next collection, The Seven Ages (2001) similarly takes up both myth and the personal in forty-four poems whose subject matter ranges throughout the author\u2019s life, from her earliest memories to the contemplation of death. Gl\u00fcck\u2019s next book, Averno (2006) takes the myth of Persephone as its touchstone. The book\u2019s poems circle around the bonds between mothers and daughters, the poet\u2019s own fears of ageing, and a narrative concerning a modern-day Persephone. In the New York Times, Nicholas Christopher noted Gl\u00fcck\u2019s unique interest in \u201ctapping the wellsprings of myth, collective and personal, to fuel [her] imagination and, with hard-earned clarity and subtle music, to struggle with some of our oldest, most intractable fears\u2014isolation and oblivion, the dissolution of love, the failure of memory, the breakdown of the body and destruction of the spirit.\u201d\n\r\nWilliam Logan called Gl\u00fcck\u2019s\u00a0A Village Life (2009), \u201ca subversive departure for a poet used to meaning more than she can say.\u201d The book is a marked formal departure for Gl\u00fcck, relying on long lines to achieve novelistic or short-story effects. Logan saw A Village Life as a latter-day Spoon River Anthology in its use of \u201cthe village as a convenient lens to examine the lives within, which counterpoint the memories of her [Gl\u00fcck\u2019s] life without.\u201d Dana Goodyear, reviewing the book for the Los Angeles Times found A Village Life \u201celectrifying,\u201d even as it presumed to tell its \u201cpolite\u201d story of a \u201cdying agriculture community, probably in Italy, probably some time between the 1950s and today.\u201d Goodyear added: \u201cOrdinariness is part of the risk of these poems; in them, Gl\u00fcck hazards, and dodges, sentimentality. The near miss makes us shiver.\u201d Gl\u00fcck\u2019s selected Poems 1962-2012 (2012) was published to great acclaim. While highlighting her work\u2019s fierceness and \u201craking moral intensity,\u201d in the words of New York Times reviewer Dwight Garner, the collection also allowed readers to see the arc of Gl\u00fcck\u2019s formal and thematic development. According to Adam Plunkett, reviewing the collected poems in the New Republic, \u201cVery few writers share her talent for turning water into blood. But what emerges from this new, comprehensive collection\u2014spanning the entirety of her career\u2014is a portrait of a poet who has issued forth a good deal of venom but is now writing, excellently, in a softer vein.\u201d\nIn 2003 Gl\u00fcck was named the 12th US Poet Laureate. That same year, she was named the judge for the Yale Series of Younger Poets, a position she held until 2010. Her book of essays Proofs and Theories (1994) was awarded the PEN/Martha Albrand Award for Nonfiction. In addition to the Pulitzer and Bollingen Prizes, she has received many awards and honors for her work, including the Lannan Literary Award for Poetry, a Sara Teasdale Memorial Prize, the MIT Anniversary Medal, the Wallace Stevens Award, a National Humanities Medal, and a Gold Medal for Poetry from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. She has received fellowships from the Guggenheim and Rockefeller Foundations, and from the National Endowment for the Arts. In 2020 she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\r\nGl\u00fcck is currently writer-in-residence at Yale University and lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
