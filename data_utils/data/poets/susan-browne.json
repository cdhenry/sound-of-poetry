She is the author of the poetry collections Buddha\u2019s Dogs (2004), which was chosen for the Four Way Books Intro Prize in Poetry by poet Edward Hirsch, and Zephyr (2010). Her poetry has been featured in the anthologies 180 More: Extraordinary Poems for Every Day (2005) and Ordinary Genius: A Guide for the Poet Within (2009). With poet Kim Addonizio, she recorded a spoken-word and music CD, Swearing, Smoking, Drinking, & Kissing.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn her poems, Browne examines the complicated matters of daily life with clarity and irreverence. Addressing the connection between her daily walks/runs and her writing practice in an interview with the California Journal of Poetics, she noted, \u201cMy mind opens up, and things come to me. I can see better, the outer and inner and where they meet.\u201d Describing Browne\u2019s work as \u201cdaring, authentic, and fun,\u201d poet Michael Meyerhofer, reviewing Zephyr, maintained that \u201c[Browne] is able to strike right to the heart of an event, its deepest essence, by maintaining a multi-dimensional perspective\u2014which is a fancy way of saying she takes poetry seriously but knows not to take herself too seriously.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nBrowne\u2019s honors include grants and awards from the Chester T. Jones Foundation, the National Writer\u2019s Union, the River Styx International Poetry Contest, and the Los Angeles Poetry Festival as well as a Pushcart Prize nomination. Her poems have been featured on Garrison Keillor\u2019s National Public Radio program The Writer\u2019s Almanac and in Ted Kooser\u2019s syndicated newspaper column, \u201cAmerican Life in Poetry.\u201d Browne has taught at Diablo Valley College and lives in the Bay Area.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
