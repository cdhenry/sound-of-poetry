Her book The Best of It: New and Selected Poems (2010) won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry.\nRyan\u2019s tightly compressed, rhythmically dense poetry is often compared to that of Emily Dickinson and Marianne Moore; however, Ryan\u2019s often barbed wit and unique facility with \u201crecombinant\u201d rhyme has earned her the status of one of the great living American poets, and led to her appointment as U.S. Poet Laureate in 2008. She held the position for two terms, using the appointment to champion community colleges like the one in Marin County, California where she and her partner Carol Adair taught for over thirty years. In an interview with the Washington City Paper at the end of tenure, Ryan called herself a \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d who \u201cadvocated for much underpraised and underfunded community colleges across the nation.\u201d\n\r\nRyan\u2019s surprising laureateship capped years of outsider-status in the poetry world. Her quizzical, philosophical, often mordant poetry is a product of years of thought. Ryan has said that her poems do not start with imagery or sound, but rather develop \u201cthe way an oyster does, with an aggravation.\u201d Critic Meghan O\u2019Rourke has written of her work: \u201cEach poem twists around and back upon its argument like a river retracing its path; they are didactic in spirit, but a bedrock wit supports them.\u201d \u201cSharks\u2019 Teeth\u201d displays that meandering approach to her subject matter, which, Ryan says, \u201cgives my poems a coolness. I can touch things that are very hot because I\u2019ve given them some distance.\u201d\n\r\nKay Ryan is the recipient of several major awards, including fellowships from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Ingram Merrill Foundation, and the Guggenheim Foundation. She has received the Union League Poetry Prize and the Maurice English Poetry Award, as well as the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize. Since 2006 she has served as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
