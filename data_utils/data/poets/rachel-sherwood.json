She attended St. David\u2019s University College in Wales and California State University Northridge, where she cofounded the literary journal Angel\u2019s Flight and where her poem \u201cMysteries of Afternoon and Evening\u201d won\u00a0the Academy of American Poets prize. She also worked on the editorial staffs of 1822 and The Wallace Stevens Journal.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She had published poems in Angel\u2019s Flight, Beyond Baroque, and Foreign Exchange, and had given several poetry readings in the Los Angeles area.\u00a0To preserve Sherwood\u2019s memory, her friends established the Rachel Sherwood Poetry Prize at Northridge; the award is given annually to a student poet.\u00a0David Trinidad\u00a0also created Sherwood Press in her honor and published (in collaboration with Greg Boyd\u2019s Yarmouth Press) a book of Rachel Sherwood\u2019s poems,\u00a0Mysteries of Afternoon and Evening\u00a0(1981). \u00a0 Reviewing Mysteries of Afternoon and Evening in the Los Angeles Times Book Review, Peter Clothier praised Sherwood\u2019s \u201cattentive eye and sharp ear for language\u201d and pointed out that, given the circumstance of her death, \u201cthe prescience of her vision is disquietingly accurate in several of these poems.\u201d One such poem, \u201cThe Usual,\u201d concludes: \u201cit\u2019s the usual: spilt liquor, / broken dishes, wrecked cars.\u201d In his introduction to the book, Arthur Lane noted that Sherwood\u2019s \u201cwit was mordant\u2014properly so, given the time and place of her maturing, Los Angeles in the 1970\u2019s. Her appetite for life was fit for any Regency circle, though it was protected by an irony as vigilant as it was sharp-edged.\u201d Lane also wrote that \u201cbelow the balancing act that these poems carry off so well wait serious nightmares: madness, horror, the systematic brutality of the late twentieth century. Sherwood didn\u2019t slip. As a matter of record, she did so well that people didn\u2019t even notice she was working without a net. None of us knew how often she looked down.\u201d\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
