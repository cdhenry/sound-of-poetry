Critic\u00a0Catherine Fletcher writes,\u00a0\u201cWhile alternating stylistically between the narrative\u2014tinged by the Romantic tradition\u2014and the slightly surreal, much of Handal\u2019s work is also marked by various forms of fragmentation. Within poems from all her collections, she often deconstructs the bodies of her subjects into their parts and houses into their elements: doors, walls, and windows.\u201d\u00a0Handal edited\u00a0The Poetry of Arab Women: A Contemporary Anthology\u00a0(2000), which won\u00a0the PEN Oakland Josephine Miles Book Award.
