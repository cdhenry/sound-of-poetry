As J.D. McClatchy said of Wunderlich\u2019s debut, \u201cThe Anchorage bravely takes up the raw mess of desire and pain, the cold ache of longing and loss, and in sleek and searing poems exposes the way we live now to the larger powers of the racing heart and the radiant imagination.\u201d Wunderlich\u2019s poems engage themes of sexuality, spirituality, and power, balancing a baroque attention to detail with driving movement.\nHis honors include fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, the Massachusetts Cultural Council, and the Bread Loaf Writers Conference. He has also been awarded the Amy Lowell Poetry Travelling Scholarship and the Wallace Stegner Fellowship from Stanford University. His poetry has been featured in numerous anthologies, including The New Young American Poets (2000, ed. Kevin Prufer), and Word of Mouth: An Anthology of Gay American Poetry (2000, ed. Timothy Liu).\nWunderlich has taught writing at Sarah Lawrence College, San Francisco State University, and Bennington College. He lives in New York\u2019s Hudson River Valley.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
