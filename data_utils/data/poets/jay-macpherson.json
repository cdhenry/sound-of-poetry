She earned a BA at Carleton University, a BLS at McGill University, and a PhD at Victoria College, University of Toronto, where she studied with the literary critic Northrop Frye.\r\n\u00a0\r\nMacpherson\u2019s formal, allusive, and often wry lyric poems invigorate myth and fable, blending contemporary and archetypal imagery. Macpherson is the author of several poetry collections, including Nineteen Poems (1952); The Boatman (1957), which won the Canadian Governor General\u2019s Award; and Welcoming Disaster (1974). Her scholarly work includes the textbook Four Ages of Man: The Classical Myths (1962), Pratt\u2019s Romantic Mythology: The Witches\u2019 Brew (1972), and The Spirit of Solitude: Conventions and Continuities in Late Romance (1982).\r\n\u00a0\r\nMacpherson won Poetry\u2019s Levinson Prize in 1957. She was a founding publisher of the now-defunct literary press Emblem Books, and she was a professor emerita at Victoria College.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Canada"]}}
