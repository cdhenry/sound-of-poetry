She earned a BA from Empire State College in 1978 and an MFA from Cornell University in 1982. She is the author of numerous books, including\u00a0the poetry collection Barely Composed (2015);\u00a0The Nightingales of Troy (2008), a collection of linked stories; and\u00a0Cascade Experiment: Selected Poems (2004). Fulton has received many honors and awards for her work. Her book\u00a0Felt\u00a0(2001) received the Bobbitt Prize for Poetry from the Library of Congress. She is the recipient of an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature and has also received fellowships from the MacArthur Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Ingram Merrill Foundation, the Michigan Society of Fellows, and the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown. Fulton\u2019s other poetry books include\u00a0Sensual Math (1995),\u00a0Powers Of Congress (1990, 2001),\u00a0Palladium (1986), and\u00a0Dance Script With Electric Ballerina (1982). An essay collection,\u00a0Feeling as a Foreign Language: The Good Strangeness of Poetry (1999), was published by Graywolf Press. Fulton's poetry and fiction have appeared in\u00a0The Best of the Best American Poetry,\u00a0The Best American Short Stories, and\u00a0The Pushcart Prize Anthology. Fulton\u2019s poems have also been set to music by contemporary composers such as Anthony Cornicello, William Bolcom, and Enid Sutherland; the pieces have premiered in spaces such as the Guggenheim Museum, Carnegie Hall, and the Walker Arts Center.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nFulton\u2019s poetry is known for its innovative approach to line and language, as well as the variety and depth of its content. Scholar Cristanne Miller has noted that while \u201cstrikingly flexible in their diction and manner, Fulton\u2019s poems include an extraordinary range of topics, perspectives, and voices.\u201d Miller went on to describe Fulton\u2019s idiosyncratic style: \u201cWhile the diction of Fulton\u2019s poems often includes puns and slang, the topics are deeply serious. The poems are epistemological in their concerns: what is it possible to know? how does scientific knowledge affect the perceptions of common sense? how do the powers of language relate to media culture, scientific discovery, imperialism, gender, and the petty inhumanity or graciousness of everyday feelings and events? At the same time, the poems are generous, reminding us through the experimental complexity of their forms and language that we are not just \u2018towers / of blood and ignorance.\u2019\u201d Fulton has written extensively on poetics, including in\u00a0Feeling as a Foreign Language (1999), where she elaborates on her idea of \u201cfractal poetics,\u201d as well as her use of the \u201cdouble equal sign,\u201d a punctuation mark she began using in\u00a0Sensual Math.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn an interview in\u00a0Memorious,\u00a0Fulton elaborated on both ideas: \u201cA fractal poem might splice a complex, dense passage to a flat or transparent line,\u201d she told Les Kay. \u201cThe friction between the two registers of diction can create an uncanny dissonance. In this way, didactic lines can be part of a larger oblique structure. The context, the surrounding dictions and tones, changes the transparent lines, which in turn affect the denser lines. \u2026 These transparent, potentially cheesy lines are embedded in a structure that includes other, more demanding sorts of language\u2014lyrical, technical, satirical. A fractal poem sets plain language in a linguistic surround that skews\u2014and charges\u2014the plainness.\u201d Of her use of the double equal sign, she said: \u201cI also was interested in devising a punctuation mark that could have content without having a firm denotation or definition. And I thought the sign could signal syntactical deletion. That aspect was suggested by Dickinson. In one poem, I called the sign \u2018dash to the max,\u2019 \u2018dash to the second power\u2014because it\u2019s a\u00a0double\u00a0equal.\u2019 Then, too, I was influenced by\u00a0A.R. Ammons\u2019s use of the colon. Ammons didn\u2019t devise a new punctuation mark, but his poems are riddled with colons that become more than punctuation marks. He forces you to interpret the colon.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nFulton is the Ann S. Bowers Professor of English at Cornell University.\n", "attrs": {}}
