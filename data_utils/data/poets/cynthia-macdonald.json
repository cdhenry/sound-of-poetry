At the age of 12, she attended her first opera at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. She was taken with the music and began attending regularly. She attended Bennington College, where she earned a BA in English, while minoring in music, and then returned to New York to study voice. Following her marriage, she sang in small opera companies and music clubs. In the early 1960s, encouraged by poet Anne Sexton, she began to write poetry. She taught at the Johns Hopkins University and later at the University of Houston, where she founded the MFA program.\u00a0The recipient of many awards, Macdonald received three NEA grants (for both poetry and libretto) a Guggenheim Fellowship, and an American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Award.\nMacdonald\u2019s poetry is driven by transformed objects, grotesque images, and dream-like sequences. Drawing on sources as varied as Danish choreography, European art, nursery rhymes, and mythology, she displays a dark sense of humor as she explores the pain of human life. \u201cTo appreciate Macdonald,\u201d wrote Frances Mayes in the San Jose Mercury News,\u00a0\u201done has to be able to enjoy a mad tea party in progress.\u201d\nMacdonald\u2019s first book, Amputations (1972), was praised by many critics for its unnerving imagery and lively wordplay. As the title implies, each poem in the collection features a character with missing body parts, which symbolize inner losses of love and life. Macdonald rendered grotesque images with dark humor in Amputations, but in Transplants (1976), her next collection, she altered her style. As Elizabeth Stone described it in the Village Voice,\u00a0\u201dAll her people and all her voices are more substantial, more complicated.\u201d The characters are still \u201cthe targets of [Macdonald\u2019s] wit, yes, but also the recipients of her compassion.\u201d\nDiscussing Macdonald\u2019s progression as a poet, a Dictionary of Literary Biography essayist commented that Macdonald\u2019s later work has demonstrated \u201ca marked change from the flippant humor and sensationalism of the first books,\u201d and exhibits a \u201cdeveloping poise and integrity.\u201d Liz Rosenberg, a reviewer for the New York Times Book Review, also saw Macdonald\u2019s body of work as one that showed much change. Discussing the collection Alternate Means of Transport (1985), Rosenberg called it \u201ca marked departure from her earlier work\u201d that is \u201ceven more powerful.\u201d The collection Living Wills, Rosenberg believed, further \u201creveals the poet\u2019s new, brighter, richer, more various palate.\u201d\nThe collection I Can\u2019t Remember\u00a0(1997) shows Macdonald at her \u201cinventive and buoyant\u201d best, telling stories in verse, using poetic forms \u201cskillfully and unobtrusively,\u201d and creating poems that are \u201clike bright, hard-edged puzzles that snap smartly into place,\u201d wrote Donna Seaman in Booklist. I Can\u2019t Remember is \u201can active engagement of Freudian clich\u00e9\u201d that \u201cworks here toward playful self-revelation,\u201d remarked Poetry contributor Michael Scharf. I Can\u2019t Remember reveals the poet\u2019s quest to find the source of her inspiration, according to a Publishers Weekly reviewer, who added, \u201cMacdonald addresses what she does not know with lyric wit and clarity.\u201d\nIn addition to her career in teaching and writing, Macdonald also practiced as a psychoanalyst specializing in treatment of patients with writer\u2019s block. Her clients included not only professional writers, but workers in other fields who cannot write the reports and documentation required by their jobs. \u201cAll people who really want to write and can\u2019t, or who really need to write and can\u2019t, have real conflict and real oppositions,\u201d Macdonald was quoted as saying in a Houston Chronicle article by Thom Marshall. \u201cOne part of them is saying you have to do this, you want to do this, and the other part is saying you\u2019re not allowed to.\u201d\nMacdonald died in Logan, Utah on August 3, 2015.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
