He created an immensely popular Romantic hero\u2014defiant, melancholy, haunted by secret guilt\u2014for which, to many, he seemed the model. He is also a Romantic paradox: a leader of the era\u2019s poetic revolution, he named Alexander Pope as his master; a worshiper of the ideal, he never lost touch with reality; a deist and freethinker, he retained from his youth a Calvinist sense of original sin; a peer of the realm, he championed liberty in his works and deeds, giving money, time, energy, and finally his life to the Greek war of independence. His faceted personality found expression in satire, verse narrative, ode, lyric, speculative drama, historical tragedy, confessional poetry, dramatic monologue, seriocomic epic, and voluminous correspondence, written in Spenserian stanzas, heroic couplets, blank verse, terza rima, ottava rima, and vigorous prose. In his dynamism, sexuality, self-revelation, and demands for freedom for oppressed people everywhere, Byron captivated the Western mind and heart as few writers have, stamping upon 19th-century letters, arts, politics, even clothing styles, his image and name as the embodiment of Romanticism.\nGeorge Gordon Noel Byron was born, with a clubbed right foot, in London on January 22, 1788. He was the son of Catherine Gordon of Gight, an impoverished Scots heiress, and Captain John (\u201cMad Jack\u201d) Byron, a fortune-hunting widower with a daughter, Augusta. The profligate captain squandered his wife\u2019s inheritance, was absent for the birth of his only son, and eventually decamped for France as an exile from English creditors, where he died in 1791 at 36.\nEmotionally unstable, Catherine Byron raised her son in an atmosphere variously colored by her excessive tenderness, fierce temper, insensitivity, and pride. She was as likely to mock his lameness as to consult doctors about its correction. From his Presbyterian nurse Byron developed a lifelong love for the Bible and an abiding fascination with the Calvinist doctrines of innate evil and predestined salvation. Early schooling instilled a devotion to reading and especially a \u201cgrand passion\u201d for history that informed much of his later writing.\nWith the death in 1798 of his great-uncle, the \u201cWicked\u201d fifth Lord Byron, George became the sixth Baron Byron of Rochdale, heir to Newstead Abbey, the family seat in Nottinghamshire. He enjoyed the role of landed nobleman, proud of his coat of arms with its mermaid and chestnut horses surmounting the motto \u201cCrede Byron\u201d (\u201cTrust Byron\u201d).\nAn \u201cebullition of passion\u201d for his cousin Margaret Parker in 1800 inspired his \u201cfirst dash into poetry.\u201d\u00a0 From 1801 to 1805, he attended the Harrow School, where he excelled in oratory, wrote verse, and played sports. He also formed the first of those passionate attachments with other, chiefly younger, boys that he would enjoy throughout his life; before reaching his teen years he had been sexually initiated by his maid. There can be little doubt that he had strong bisexual tendencies, though relationships with women seem generally, but not always, to have satisfied his emotional needs more fully.\nIn the summer of 1803 he fell so deeply in love with his distant cousin, the beautiful-and engaged-Mary Chaworth of Annesley Hall, that he interrupted his education for a term to be near her. Years later he told Thomas Medwin that all his \u201cfables about the celestial nature of women\u201d originated from \u201cthe perfection\u201d his imagination created in Mary Chaworth.\nEarly in 1804 he began an intimate correspondence with his half sister, Augusta, five years his senior. He asked that she consider him \u201cnot only as a Brother\u201d but as her \u201cwarmest and most affectionate Friend.\u201d As he grew apart from his capricious, often violent, mother, he drew closer to Augusta.\nByron attended Trinity College, Cambridge, intermittently from October 1805 until July 1808, when he received a MA degree. During \u201cthe most romantic period of [his] life,\u201d he experienced a \u201cviolent, though pure, love and passion\u201d for John Edleston, a choirboy at Trinity two years younger than he. Intellectual pursuits interested him less than such London diversions as fencing and boxing lessons, the theater, demimondes, and gambling. Living extravagantly, he began to amass the debts that would bedevil him for years. In Southwell, where his mother had moved in 1803, he prepared his verses for publication.\nIn November 1806 he distributed around Southwell his first book of poetry. Fugitive Pieces, printed at his expense and anonymously, collects the poems inspired by his early infatuations, friendships, and experiences at Harrow, Cambridge, and elsewhere. When his literary adviser, the Reverend John Thomas Becher, a local minister, objected to the frank eroticism of certain lines, Byron suppressed the volume. A revised and expurgated selection of verses appeared in January 1807 as Poems on Various Occasions, in an edition of 100 copies, also printed privately and anonymously. An augmented collection, Hours of Idleness, \u201cBy George Gordon, Lord Byron, A Minor,\u201d was published in June. The new poems in this first public volume of his poetry are little more than schoolboy translations from the classics and imitations of such pre-Romantics as Thomas Gray, Thomas Chatterton, and Robert Burns, and of contemporaries including Walter Scott and Thomas Moore. Missing were the original flashes of eroticism and satire that had enlivened poems in the private editions. The work has value for what it reveals about the youthful poet\u2019s influences, interests, talent, and direction. In \u201cOn a Change of Masters at a Great Public School,\u201d he employs heroic couplets for satiric effect in the manner of Alexander Pope, a model for Byron throughout his career. In obviously autobiographical poems Byron experiments with personae, compounded of his true self and of fictive elements, which both disclose and disguise him. Groups of verses on a single subject show his understanding of the effectiveness of multiple points of view.\nIt was as a published poet that Byron returned to Cambridge in June 1807. Besides renewing acquaintances, he formed an enduring friendship with John Cam Hobhouse\u2014his beloved \u201cHobby.\u201d Inclined to liberalism in politics, Byron joined Hobhouse in the Cambridge Whig Club. In February 1808 the influential Whig journal the Edinburgh Review, published anonymously Henry Brougham\u2019s notice of Hours of Idleness, which combined justifiable criticism of the book with unwarranted personal assaults on the author. The scornfully worded review had a beneficial effect. Stung and infuriated, Byron set aside mawkish, derivative, occasional verse and began avenging himself through satire, expanding his poetic commentary on present-day \u201cBritish Bards,\u201d started the previous year, to include a counterblast against \u201cScotch Reviewers.\"\nIn March 1809, two months after attaining his majority, he took his seat in the House of Lords. Shortly thereafter, Byron\u2019s first major poetic work, English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers. A Satire, was published anonymously in an edition of 1,000 copies. Inspired by the Dunciad of his idol, Pope, the poem, in heroic couplets, takes indiscriminate aim at most of the poets and playwrights of the moment, notably Walter Scott, Robert Southey, William Wordsworth, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. His main target is the critics. From these \u201charpies that must be fed\u201d he singles out for condemnation \u201cimmortal\u201d Francis Jeffrey, whom he mistakenly assumed had written the offending comments on Hours of Idleness in the Edinburgh Review.\nThe satire created a stir and found general favor with the reviewers. The overall aim, as stated in the preface, is \u201cto make others write better.\u201d Of the major Romantic poets, Byron most sympathized with neoclassicism, with its order, discipline, and clarity. The importance of English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers lies not only in its vigor and vitality but in Byron\u2019s lively advocacy of the neoclassical virtues found in such 17th- and 18th-century poets as Dryden and Pope, and, from his own day, in Gifford. His admiration for Pope never wavered, nor did he ever totally abandon the heroic couplet and Augustan role of censor and moralist, as seen in Hints from Horace (written 1811), The Curse of Minerva (written 1811), and The Age of Bronze (written 1822-1823).\nFeeling revenged on the reviewers, Byron was anxious to realize a long-held dream of traveling abroad. Though in debt, he gathered together sufficient resources to allow him to begin a tour of the eastern Mediterranean. Anxious to set down the myriad experiences the trip afforded him, Byron began an autobiographical poem in Ioannina, Greece, on October 31, 1809, wherein he recorded the adventures and reflections of Childe Burun (a combination of the archaic title for a youth of noble birth and an ancient form of his own surname); he subsequently renamed the hero Harold. The Spenserian stanza in which he cast his impressions no doubt derived from his readings in Edmund Spenser\u2019s Faerie Queene reprinted in an anthology he had carried on his trip. Byron completed the first canto in Athens at the end of the year.\nTurning southward, he and Hobhouse journeyed through Missolonghi and rode into Athens on Christmas night 1809. They lodged at the foot of the Acropolis with Mrs. Tarsia Macri, widow of a Greek who had been British vice consul. Byron soon fell in love with her three daughters, all under the age of 15, but especially with Theresa, only 12, his \u201cMaid of Athens.\"\nExcursions in January 1810 to Cape Sounion, overlooking the islands of the Cyclades, and to Marathon, where the Athenians defeated the invading Persians in 490 B.C., reinforced for him the appalling contrast between the glory and might of ancient Greece and its contemporary disgrace. He movingly evoked these scenes and sentiments a decade later in the often-quoted stanzas on \u201cThe Isles of Greece\u201d and on Marathon in Don Juan.\nIn March 1810 Byron and Hobhouse extended their tour into Turkey. On March 28, in Smyrna, he completed the second canto of Childe Harold, incorporating his adventures in Albania and his thoughts on Greece. He visited the plain of Troy and on May 3, while Hobhouse read Ovid\u2019s Hero and Leander, imitated Leander\u2019s feat of swimming the Hellespont; within a week, lines \u201cWritten After Swimming from Sestos to Abydos\u201d commemorated his pride in this exploit. In July he traveled back to Athens, where he settled in the Capuchin monastery below the Acropolis. Here, he studied Italian and modern Greek, just as he would learn Armenian from monks in Venice six years later.\nStirred to literary composition, he first produced explanatory notes for Childe Harold; then, in February and March 1811, he wrote two poems in heroic couplets. Hints from Horace, a sequel to English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers, satirizes contemporary poetry and drama, while praising Dryden, Pope, Swift, and Butler.\nByron arrived at Sheerness, Kent, on July 14, two years and 12 days after his departure. To Augusta he wrote on September 9 that he had probably acquired nothing by his travels but \u201ca smattering of two languages & a habit of chewing Tobacco,\u201d but this claim was disingenuous. \u201cIf I am a poet,\u201d he mused, \u201c... the air of Greece has made me one.\u201d He had accumulated source material for any number of works. More, exposure to all manner of persons, behavior, government, and thought had transformed him into a citizen of the world, with broadened political opinions and a clear-sighted view of prejudice and hypocrisy in the \u201ctight little island\u201d of England. Significantly, he would select as the epigraph for Childe Harold a passage from Le Cosmopolite, ou, le Citoyen du Monde (1753), by Louis Charles Fougeret de Monbron, that, in part, compares the universe to a book of which one has read but the first page if he has seen only his own country.\nWithin three weeks of his return, Byron was plunged into a period of prolonged mourning. His mother died on August 2, before he set out for Newstead. Whatever her failings, she had loved her son, taken pride in his accomplishments, and managed Newstead economically in his absence. \u201cI had but one friend in the world,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cand she is gone.\u201d News of the deaths of two classmates followed hard upon this sorrow. Then, in October, he learned of the death from consumption of John Edleston, the former choirboy at Trinity College. Deeply affected, he lamented his loss in the lines \u201cTo Thyrza\u201d (1811), a woman\u2019s name concealing the subject\u2019s true identity and gender. He also commemorated Edleston in additions to Childe Harold.\nIn January 1812 Byron resumed his seat in the House of Lords, allying himself with the Liberal Whigs. During his political career he spoke but three times in the House of Lords, taking unpopular sides. In his maiden speech on February 27 he defended stocking weavers in his home area of Nottinghamshire who had broken the improved weaving machinery, or frames, that deprived them of work and reduced them to near starvation; he opposed as cruel and unjust a government-sponsored bill that made frame breaking a capital offense. On April 21, he made a plea for Catholic emancipation, the most controversial issue of the day.\nUpon his return to England in July 1811, Byron had given the manuscript of Childe Harold to R.C. Dallas, his adviser in the publication of English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers. Dallas enthusiastically showed the poem to John Murray II, the respected publisher of Scott and Southey, who agreed to publish Byron, beginning a rich association between publisher and poet.\nOn March 10, 1812 Murray published Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage, Cantos I and II. 500 quarto copies, priced at 30 shillings each, sold out in three days. An octavo edition of 3,000 copies at 12 shillings was on the market within two days. Shortly after Childe Harold appeared, Byron remarked, \u201cI awoke one morning and found myself famous.\u201d Murray brought out five editions of the poem in 1812 alone, and published the 10th, and last, separate edition in 1815. In less than six months sales had reached 4,500 copies. In the Edinburgh Review, Jeffrey cited as the \u201cchief excellence\u201d of Childe Harold \u201ca singular freedom and boldness, both of thought and expression, and a great occasional force and felicity of diction.\u201d\nChilde Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage, Cantos I and II, can be read as Byron\u2019s poetic journal of his Mediterranean and Eastern tour in 1809 to 1811. But the international popularity of the work derived less from its appeal as a travelogue than from its powerful articulation of the Weltschmerz, or \u201cWorld-weariness,\u201d born of the chaos of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars that disrupted all of European society.\nIn Canto I Harold, \u201csore sick at heart\u201d with his life of \u201crevel and ungodly glee,\u201d leaves his native Albion on pilgrimage to find peace and spiritual rebirth. As befits a quest poem, Childe Harold is subtitled A Romaunt, recalling the medieval romances whose knighted heroes go in search of holy objects, and is cast in the stanza and archaic language of Spenser\u2019s Faerie Queene.\nHarold was introduced, Byron wrote in the preface, \u201cfor the sake of giving some connexion to the piece.\u201d By labeling Harold \u201ca fictitious character\u201d Byron sought to dissociate himself from his protagonist, but his readers, noting many and striking similarities, persisted in equating the artist with his hero. Though he, too, speculated on such a relationship, Walter Scott, recognized that in Harold Byron had created a new and significant Romantic character type which reappeared in almost all his heroes.\nHarold is the first \u201cByronic Hero.\u201d Of complicated ancestry (admirably traced by Peter L. Thorslev, Jr.), he descends, with inherited traits, from Prometheus, Milton\u2019s Satan, the sentimental heroes found in Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, hero-villains in Gothic novels by Horace Walpole and Ann Radcliffe, Friedrich von Schiller\u2019s Karl Moor, and Sir Walter Scott\u2019s Marmion. Thorslev insists that, as befits their complex genealogy, Byron\u2019s various heroes exhibit not uniformity, but considerable diversity. Among their traits are romantic melancholy, guilt for secret sin, pride, defiance, restlessness, alienation, revenge, remorse, moodiness, and such noble virtues as honor, altruism, courage, and pure love for a gentle woman.\nThe drawing rooms and salons of Whig society vied for Byron\u2019s presence and lionized him. At Holland House, he met the spirited, impulsive Lady Caroline Lamb, who initially judged him \u201cmad\u2014bad\u2014and dangerous to know.\u201d Their tempestuous affair lasted through the summer, until Byron rejected her; she continued the pursuit, burned \u201ceffigies\u201d of his picture, and transformed their relationship into a Gothic romance in her novel Glenarvon (1816).\nDespite its outcome, his connection with Lady Caroline left him on friendly terms with her mother-in-law, the witty Elizabeth Milbanke Lamb, Lady Melbourne. Through her, in September, he proposed marriage to her niece, Anne Isabella (Annabella) Milbanke, as a possible means of escaping the insistent Caroline. A 20-year-old bluestocking, Annabella was widely read in literature and philosophy and showed a talent for mathematics. She declined the proposal in the belief that Byron would never be \u201cthe object of that strong affection\u201d which would make her \u201chappy in domestic life.\u201d With good humor and perhaps relief Byron accepted the refusal; in a letter of October 18, 1812 he thanked Lady Melbourne for her efforts with his \u201cPrincess of Parallelograms.\u201d By November he was conducting an affair with the mature Jane Elizabeth Scott, Lady Oxford, a patroness of the Reform Movement.\nBetween June 1813 and February 1816, Byron completed and had published six extremely popular verse tales, five of them influenced by his travels in Greece and Turkey: The Giaour (June 1813), The Bride of Abydos (December 1813), The Corsair (February 1814), Lara (August 1814), and The Siege of Corinth and Parisina (February 1816). Walter Scott had created the market for Romantic narratives in verse, but Byron outrivaled him with his erotic fare set in \u201cexotic\u201d climes, to the extent that Scott gave up the genre in favor of novel writing.\nIn June 1813 Byron began an affair with his 29-year-old half sister, Augusta. Married since 1807 to her cousin, Colonel George Leigh, with his mother\u2019s death in 1811, Augusta became Byron\u2019s sole remaining close relative. While no legal proof exists, the circumstantial evidence in Byron\u2019s letters dating from August 1813 to his horrified confidante Lady Melbourne strongly suggests an incestuous connection with Augusta.\nIn the midst of this relationship, Byron received a letter from Annabella Milbanke, who confessed her mistake in rejecting his proposal and cautiously sought to renew their friendship. Correspondence ensued. He later wrote Lady Melbourne that Augusta wished him \u201cmuch to marry\u2014because it was the only chance of redemption for two persons.\"\nThrough poetry he found relief from his involvement with Augusta and from an inconclusive flirtation in the autumn of 1813 with Lady Frances Wedderburn Webster. In November he wrote Thomas Moore, \u201cAll convulsions end with me in rhyme; and to solace my midnights, I have scribbled another Turkish Tale.\u201d The Bride of Abydos, published by Murray in December, sold 6,000 copies in one month. For the first time in this volume Byron dealt with the theme of incest, his \u201cperverse passion,\u201d as he told Lady Melbourne, to which he would return in such poems as Parisina, Manfred, and Cain.\nAnother burst of poetic creativity overlapped the success of The Bride of Abydos. Between December 18 and 31, Byron produced a third Oriental tale, The Corsair. On the day of publication in February 1814 10,000 copies were sold, \u201ca thing,\u201d Murray excitedly assured him, \u201cperfectly unprecedented.\u201d\nOn April 10, 1814, amid rumors of the abdication and exile of the emperor Napoleon (which in fact occurred the next day), Byron wrote and copied Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte. On the 16th, it was published anonymously. Since Harrow, Byron had had mixed feelings about Napoleon. He admired the titanic qualities of the brilliant strategist, dynamic soldier, and statesman, but he was repelled by his brutal conquest of Iberia and his perversion of liberal ideals. That ambivalence colors the poem.\nOn April 15, 1814 Augusta gave birth to a little girl, Elizabeth Medora. When Medora Leigh grew up, she believed herself to be Byron\u2019s daughter, although Byron never acknowledged the paternity, as he did for his other illegitimate offspring, either because of uncertainty or concern for his and Augusta\u2019s reputations. There is no extant proof either way. On May 14, Byron began a sequel to The Corsair entitled Lara, the new name of Conrad the pirate. Murray published the work anonymously in August in a volume with Samuel Rogers\u2019s sentimental tale Jacqueline; the book sold 6,000 copies in three editions.\nByron spent much of the summer of 1814 with Augusta, while continuing to correspond with Annabella. In a letter dated September 9, he made a tentative proposal of marriage; she promptly accepted it. In marriage Byron hoped to find a rational pattern of living and to reconcile the conflicts that plagued him. After inauspicious hesitations and postponements, many of his own making, Byron married Annabella on January 2, 1815 in the parlor of her parents\u2019 home in Seaham; there was no reception. Toward his bride the groom was by turns tender and abusive.\nAt Halnaby Hall Byron resumed work on the Hebrew Melodies, lyrics for airs Jewish composer Isaac Nathan was adapting from the music of the synagogue. Throughout his life Byron was a fervent reader of the Bible and a lover of traditional songs and legends. As a champion of freedom, he may also have responded instinctively to the oppression long suffered by the Jewish people. The work opens with the now-famous lyric, \u201cShe Walks in Beauty,\u201d written in 1814 after Byron saw a cousin at a party wearing a dress of mourning with spangles on it.\nIn April, after a tempestuous visit with Augusta, Lord and Lady Byron settled in the Duchess of Devonshire\u2019s London house, at 13 Piccadilly Terrace. Throughout 1815 financial problems and heavy drinking drove Byron into rages and fits of irrational behavior. When Annabella was in an advanced stage of pregnancy, he made her the scapegoat for his troubles. On December 10, 1815, she gave birth to Augusta Ada Byron (the first name was later dropped). Early in the new year, increased money worries forced Byron to suggest that they move from their expensive Piccadilly Terrace address. Lady Byron and Augusta Ada would precede him to her family\u2019s estate in Leicestershire, Kirkby Mallory, while he attempted to placate the creditors. Early in the morning of January 15, 1816, Lady Byron and Augusta Ada left London by carriage for Kirkby Mallory before Byron had risen. He never saw them again.\nFrom Kirkby Mallory Lady Byron wrote affectionately to her husband in London, urging him to join her. Her subsequent revelations to her parents about Byron\u2019s threatening speech and cruel behavior turned them against him. On February 2,\u00a0 her father wrote Byron to propose a quiet separation. Byron was shocked. Unavailing was his protest, in a letter to his wife on the 15th, that he loved his \u201cdearest Bell ... to the dregs of [his] memory & existence.\u201d A week later, Lady Byron probably confessed to her lawyer her suspicion of incest between Byron and Augusta, adding it to the prior charges of adultery and cruelty; by the end of the month, the rumors about brother and sister were widespread. On March 17 the terms for the legal separation were agreed upon.\nDuring the separation crisis, Byron had a casual liaison with Claire (Jane) Clairmont. That she was the stepdaughter of the philosopher William Godwin and the stepsister of Mary Godwin, with whom Percy Bysshe Shelley had eloped in 1814, may have induced him to tolerate her determined advances, which he had no intention of encouraging.\nByron signed the final deed of separation on April 21, having decided to go abroad with the completion of this formality. On the 25th, they sailed from Dover bound for Ostend. Byron would never see England again.\nThe party reached Geneva on May 25, 1816. Byron was unaware that waiting for him were Claire Clairmont, pregnant with his child, Shelley, and Mary Godwin. They passed the time agreeably by boating on Lake Leman and conversing at the Villa Diodati, which Byron had rented, with its commanding view of the lake and the Juras beyond. In this environment Mary wrote Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, published in 1818.\nIn June Byron and Shelley sailed to the Ch\u00e2teau de Chillon. The story of Fran\u00e7ois Bonivard, a 16th-century Swiss patriot and political prisoner in the ch\u00e2teau\u2019s dungeon, inspired Byron to compose one of his most popular poems, The Prisoner of Chillon. The simplicity and directness of Bonivard\u2019s dramatic monologue throw into relief the powerful theme of political tyranny. In Bonivard, Byron created a protagonist free from the traits of the typical \u201cByronic hero,\u201d one who possessed greater credibility and maturity than his predecessors. The poem, in turn, expresses deeper human understanding and advances more positive values than earlier works.\nOn July 4, three days after returning from his boat tour of Lake Leman, Byron completed the third canto of Childe Harold. Its framework is a poetic travelogue based on his journey from Dover to Waterloo, then along the Rhine and into Switzerland. Having failed to maintain a convincing distinction between himself and his hero in the previous cantos, Byron drops the pretense and speaks in his own right. Harold becomes a shadowy presence who disappears in the middle of the canto, absorbed into the narrator. The new protagonist, a Hero of Sensibility, expresses the melancholy, passion, and alienation of the original Harold, as well as Byronic liberalism, sensitivity, and meditation.\nFour major themes inform the third canto. The invocation in the opening stanza\u2014made not to the Muse or another classical figure but to Ada, \u201csole daughter of my house and heart\"\u2014sounds the theme of personal sorrow. The poet-hero is alone, in voluntary exile, \u201cgrown aged in this world of woe.\u201d \u201cStill round him clung invisibly a chain / Which gall\u2019d for ever, fettering though unseen, / And heavy though it clank\u2019d not ....\u201d He remains \u201cProud though in desolation.\"\nThe sight of the field of Waterloo, \u201cthis place of skulls, / The grave of France,\u201d prompts the second theme, an analysis of the strengths and flaws of genius in Napoleon and Rousseau. Byron recognized himself in the characters of both men. Like Napoleon he was \u201cantithetically mixt,\u201d \u201cExtreme in all things,\u201d and possessed of \u201ca fire / And motion of the soul\u201d that \u201cPreys upon high adventure.\u201d Like \u201cthe self-torturing sophist, wild Rousseau, / The apostle of affliction,\u201d he \u201cthrew / Enchantment over passion, and from woe / Wrung overwhelming eloquence.\"\nRousseau, whose writings helped to kindle the French Revolution, and Napoleon, whose campaigns doomed the hopes born of that struggle, relate directly to the canto\u2019s theme of war. Byron despised wars of aggression waged for personal gain while championing as honorable those conflicts that defended freedom, such as the battles of Marathon and Morat and the French Revolution. Bravura rhetoric animates the stanzas on Waterloo, from the memorable recreation of the Duchess of Richmond\u2019s ball in Brussels on the night before the battle, to Byron\u2019s grim evocation of war\u2014a contemplation of the futility of bravery and of the blood shed in purposeless slaughter.\nThe pilgrim-poet temporarily experiences the thrill of a transcendental concept of nature, the fourth theme of the canto:\n\nI live not in myself, but I become\r\nPortion of that around me; and to me,\r\nHigh mountains are a feeling....\r\nAnd thus I am absorb\u2019d, and this is life [.]\n\nBut Byron\u2019s affinity with reality prevented him from \u201cSpurning the clay-cold bonds which round our being cling.\u201d Nature would provide him with no permanent escape from himself, no remedy for his suffering.\n\nNear the end he returns to his first theme, of personal sorrow defiantly borne by a Promethean rebel:\r\nI have not loved the world, nor the world me;\r\nI have not flattered its rank breath, nor bow\u2019d\r\nTo its idolatries a patient knee [.]\n\nHe closes the canto as he began it, with an apostrophe to his daughter, \u201cThe child of love.\"\nThe arrival of Hobhouse at the end of August coincided with the departure of Shelley, Mary, and Claire, who returned to England with the manuscripts of the third canto of Childe Harold, The Prisoner of Chillon, and the shorter poems; on January 12, 1817, Claire gave birth to a daughter Byron named Clara Allegra. When a tour of the Bernese Alps with Hobhouse failed to \u201clighten the weight\u201d on his heart or enable him to lose his \u201cown wretched identity,\u201d Byron turned, as usual, to poetry to purge his broodings and guilt over the separation, Augusta, and his exile. The catharsis assumed a form new to him\u2014blank-verse drama. He would write, \u201cnot a drama properly\u2014but a dialogue,\u201d set in the high Alps he had recently visited. He rewrote the third act during a trip to Rome the following May. Manfred, the eponymous protagonist, is essentially Byron, the drama\u2019s conflict a fusion of the personal and the cosmic, its goal relief.\nCount Manfred, tortured by \u201cthe strong curse\u201d on his soul for some unutterable, inexpiable, \u201chalf-maddening sin\u201d (II.i), seeks \u201cForgetfulness\u2014/ ... / Of that which is within me\u201d (I.i). In the first scene, proud and defiant, he revels in the supremacy of his will over the spirits he raises who are powerless over the inner self:\n\nThe mind, the spirit, the Promethean spark,\r\nThe lightning of my being, is as bright,\r\nPervading, and far-darting as your own,\r\nAnd shall not yield to yours, though coop\u2019d in clay!\n\nAs an abbot witnesses his stoic demise, Manfred explains: \u201cOld man! \u2018tis not so difficult to die.\u201d The unconquerable individual to the end, Manfred gives his soul to neither heaven nor hell, only to death.\nMurray published Childe Harold, Canto III, on November 18, and The Prisoner of Chillon, and Other Poems on December 5. Within a week of publication, 7,000 copies of each volume had been sold. Reviewing these works in the December 1816 number of the Edinburgh Review, Jeffrey proclaimed that \u201cin force of diction, and inextinguishable energy of sentiment,\u201d Byron took \u201cprecedence of all his distinguished contemporaries.\u201d\nByron set out in mid-April 1817 to join Hobhouse in Rome. In Ferrara, his visit to the cell where the 16th-century poet Torquato Tasso had been confined for madness inspired an impassioned dramatic monologue, The Lament of Tasso.\nByron settled in mid-June at the Villa Foscarini at La Mira on the Brenta, seven miles from Venice. Here, he began to distill his memories of Rome into poetry. Composing rapidly, he had completed the first draft for 126 stanzas of Childe Harold, Canto IV, by mid-July, but he revised and expanded the manuscript for the rest of the year.\nContinuing the pilgrimage format of the earlier cantos, the framework for this longest of the sections is a spirited Italian journey from Venice through Arqua (where Byron had seen the house and tomb of Petrarch) and Ferrara (city of Tasso and Ludovico Ariosto) to Florence and on to Rome, the setting for half of the canto.\nThe pilgrim-narrator of Canto IV focuses sharply on the contrast between the transience of mighty empires, exemplified by Venice and Rome, and the transcendence of great art over human limitations, change, and death. An elegiac tone evoked by \u201cFall\u2019n states and buried greatness\u201d suffuses the verses. \u201cA ruin amidst ruins,\u201d the pilgrim-narrator digresses easily from scenes of shattered columns and broken arches to considerations of his own sufferings and of war and liberty. The days of Venice\u2019s glory are no more, \u201cbut Beauty still is here. / ... Nature doth not die.\u201d Literature, too, is permanent and beneficial. The sic transit gloria mundi theme in Childe Harold finds its finest Byronic expression in this canto, which traces through their history and ruins the \u201cdying Glory\u201d of Venice and, especially, the fall of Rome.\nIn his famous apostrophe to the ocean, beginning \u201cRoll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean\u2014roll!,\u201d Byron contrasts its permanence, power, and freedom with vanished civilizations: \u201cThy shores are empires, changed in all save thee\u2014/ Assyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage, what are they?\u201d The ocean remains, \u201cDark-heaving;\u2014boundless, endless, and sublime\u2014/ The image of Eternity....\"\nMelancholy colors the farewell; Byron knew that the Childe Harold theme had \u201cdied into an echo.\u201d But life in Venice had lifted his spirits. Before he finished this canto, he had begun the spritely Beppo, with which he returned to satire and prepared the way for Don Juan.\nLate summer 1817 marks a significant development in Byron\u2019s literary career. On August 29, he heard about the return of a supposedly deceased husband to his Venetian wife; she had meanwhile taken an amoroso, and then had to choose her husband, her lover, or solitary life on a pension. At this time, serendipitously, he happened to see John Hookham Frere\u2019s Whistlecraft (1817), a mock-heroic satire in ottava rima modeled on the Italian burlesque. The demanding rhyme scheme of ottava rima\u2014a b a b a c c\u2014encourages comic rhymes. Its couplet allows the stanza to end with a witty punch line, with a reversal in tone from high to low, or with a clever rhyme to surprise the reader. The seriocomic mood, colloquial style, and digressions of ottava rima, attracted Byron to this verse form as the medium for his witty version of the story of Venetian customs and light morals. By October 10, he had finished Beppo. His new poem, he assured Murray on March 25, 1818, would show the public that he could \u201cwrite cheerfully, & repel the charge of monotony & mannerism.\u201d\nThe story Byron tells is slight. Beppo, a Venetian merchant, returns home during Carnival after years of Turkish captivity, to discover that his wife, Laura, has taken a count for her lover. After the three pleasantly discuss the amatory triangle, the husband and wife reunite, and Beppo befriends the count. In its gaiety, verve, and absence of rhetoric, Beppo signaled a break with Byron\u2019s earlier, darker works. Banished is the soul-ravaged hero with his pride and pessimism, replaced by the poet-narrator\u2014conversational, digressive, witty, observant, cynical. Byron\u2019s first attempt at the Italian \u201cmedley poem\u201d allowed him to experiment with the style most congenial to his spirit and best suited to his talents. In this fresh, realistic voice he would create his comic masterpiece Don Juan.\nMurray published Beppo, A Venetian Story, without Byron\u2019s name on the title page, on February 28, 1818, to immediate success.\u00a0 On April 28, 1818 Murray brought out Childe Harold, Canto IV; the five printings of the first edition comprise 10,000 copies. In the Quarterly Review Scott judged that the last part of \u201cthis great poem ... sustained Lord Byron\u2019s high reputation,\u201d possessing less passion and more \u201cdeep thought and sentiment\u201d than the earlier cantos.\nEarly in June Byron moved into the Palazzo Mocenigo, with his daughter Allegra (brought to Venice by the Shelley party in April), whom he had agreed to support and educate. Here, too, he lodged his 14 servants, a menagerie, and a veritable harem.\nIn a letter to Murray dated July 10, 1818, he mentioned that he had completed an ode on Venice, and that he had \u201ctwo stories\u2014one serious & one ludicrous (a la Beppo) not yet finished\u2014& in no hurry to be so.\u201d The \u201cserious\u201d poem was Mazeppa, a Cossack verse tale of illicit love and a wild horseback ride. The \u201cludicrous\u201d work was the lengthy first canto of his comic epic Don Juan, pronounced, for the sake of the humor, to rhyme with \u201cnew one\u201d and \u201ctrue one.\u201d Over the next five years Byron added 15 more cantos to the poem, leaving a 17th unfinished at his death. Hobhouse and other friends in England praised the poetry and satire in Don Juan, Canto I, but voiced alarm at its indecencies and attacks on religion, writers, and Lady Byron (in the character of Donna Inez, Juan\u2019s \u201cmathematical\u201d mother). They urged that the manuscript be suppressed. Murray was willing, and eager, to publish the piece, especially if some of the \u201cindelicacies\u201d were omitted. But Byron would have none of his \u201cdamned cutting and slashing\"; the poem would succeed or fail on its own merits.\nByron, exhausted by debauchery, cut and slashed in his personal life, getting rid of his harem. In early April 1819 at the Benzoni conversazione, he encountered the Countess Teresa Guiccioli, whom he had met casually on his 30th birthday at the Countess Albrizzi\u2019s. Now 19, she had been married for just over a year to a rich count of 58. A strong mutual attraction quickly developed between Byron and Teresa. Having given up \u201cmiscellaneous harlotry,\u201d he settled for \u201cstrictest adultery\u201d as cavalier servente to Teresa, his \u201clast attachment.\u201d For the next four years, until his departure for Greece in July 1823, they lived in several Italian cities and towns.\nOn July 15, 1819, Murray, after some hesitation, cautiously published 1,500 copies of the first two cantos of Don Juan. Missing were Byron\u2019s savage \u201cDedication\u201d to the poet laureate Robert Southey (first published in The Works of Lord Byron, 1832) and the names of the author and publisher on the title page; only the printer, Thomas Davison, was identified, as required by English law. By tacitly admitting, through anonymous publication, that Don Juan was disreputable, Murray intensified the outcry against the work. The critics hit back with a fury virtually unprecedented, vilifying both poet and poem. Typical was the review in Blackwood\u2019s Magazine, which branded Byron as \u201ca cool unconcerned fiend\u201d who derided love, honor, patriotism, and religion in his \u201cfilthy and impious poem\"; the \u201ccoldblooded mockery\u201d of his injured wife was \u201cbrutally, fiendishly, inexpiably mean.\u201d Not all the reviews were negative. In a pseudonymous Letter to the Right Hon. Lord Byron (1821), \u201cJohn Bull\u201d (John Gibson Lockhart) encouraged him to \u201cStick to Don Juan: it is the only sincere thing you have ever written; ... it is by far the most spirited, the most straightforward, the most interesting, and the most poetical.\u201d In a review written in 1819 and published 1821, Goethe praised Don Juan as \u201ca work of boundless energy.\"\nThe dazzling range of subjects, incidents, and moods in his \u201cversified Aurora Borealis\u201d (Canto VII), and its geographical sweep, no less than its genre, justify his claim that \u201cMy poem\u2019s epic\u201d (Canto I). The stanzas teem with Byronic observations on liberty, tyranny, war, love, hypocrisy, cant, and much more. The landscape stretches from Juan\u2019s native Spain across the Mediterranean to the Greek Cyclades, up to Constantinople and on to Russia, with a digression to Kentucky, before stopping in England. Byron\u2019s literary models include the classical epics of Homer and Virgil and the Renaissance Italian epics of Ariosto and Tasso. He drew, too, on satiric prose romances as written by Fran\u00e7ios Rabelais, Miguel de Cervantes, Jonathan Swift, and Laurence Sterne, and on the picaresque novels of Henry Fielding. He humorously claims that his poem will adhere to epic conventions, all arranged \u201cWith strict regard to Aristotle\u2019s rules\u201d (Canto I), but, in fact, he writes a modern epic, indebted to the older forms but not in thrall to them.\nIn a \u201cslight difference\u201d from his \u201cepic brethren,\u201d Byron does not make Don Juan a \u201clabyrinth of fables\u201d but a story that is \u201cactually true\u201d (Canto I), based, as he told Murray, almost entirely on \u201creal life\u2014either my own\u2014or from people I knew.\u201d For the discursive, digressive manner of Don Juan, Byron returned to the versatile ottava rima he had first used in Beppo, ideally suited to the conversational style of the \u201cImprovisatore\u201d (Canto XV). The rapidity of the stanza facilitates the poem\u2019s myriad changing tones\u2014serious, cynical, sentimental, humorous, satiric, bawdy\u2014as the verse shifts from narrative to commentary, from romance to burlesque, from banter to invective.\n\"I want a hero,\u201d Byron declares in the poem\u2019s opening line, but finding that the modern age does not provide a \u201ctrue one,\u201d he will \u201ctherefore take our ancient friend Don Juan.\u201d Whereas the legendary Juan is a libertine and a heartless despoiler of women, deserving of his eternal perdition, Byron\u2019s young don is friendly, innately good, courteous, impulsive, and sensuous\u2014more the seduced than the seducer. He experiences shipwreck, slavery, war, dissipation, and illness in his travels, gaining worldly wisdom and discretion as he goes. Though he gradually becomes spoiled and blas\u00e9 in the process, the Juan of Canto XVI retains his good qualities from Canto I.\nAt La Mira with Teresa and Allegra in September 1819 Byron proceeded with the third canto of Don Juan. To Moore, his visitor in October, he presented the manuscript of his memoirs, begun in Venice the previous year and not to be published during Byron\u2019s lifetime. They were intended to be \u201cMemoranda\u2014and not Confessions,\u201d containing, among other things, \u201ca detailed account\u201d of his marriage and its \u201cconsequences.\u201d Moore sold them to Murray; on May 17, 1824, three days after news of Byron\u2019s death reached England, Hobhouse and Murray, over Moore\u2019s objections, had the memoirs burned in Murray\u2019s parlor to protect Byron\u2019s reputation.\nIn February 1820, while in residence at the Palazzo Guiccioli, Byron sent Murray, along with other works, the third and fourth cantos of Don Juan. Byron\u2019s life and writing in 1820 and 1821 evidenced a shared political theme. Influenced by Teresa\u2019s father, Count Ruggero Gamba Ghiselli, and his son, Count Pietro Gamba, both ardent patriots, he began to take a serious interest in the Carbonari, one of the secret revolutionary societies seeking to overthrow Austrian despotism. In time Byron became an honorary Capo (Chief) of a workmen\u2019s group of the Carbonari; he supplied them with arms and made his house their arsenal. The Austrian secret police increased their observation of Byron\u2019s activities and opened his mail. Uncertain about the future of Don Juan, he expended a portion of his creative energy on a trio of historical tragedies based on political subjects and modeled on neoclassical principles: Marino Faliero, Sardanapalus, and The Two Foscari. These blank-verse plays were, he maintained, closet dramas, not designed for the stage. Without Byron\u2019s permission, Marino Faliero was given seven performances at Drury Lane in April and May 1821, the only one of his plays acted in his lifetime. Adaptations of Sardanapalus and Werner (1823) enjoyed great success on the 19th-century stage.\nWith the completion of The Two Foscari in July, Byron began work on Cain, A Mystery, its subtitle an allusion to the medieval dramas on biblical themes and, he told Moore, \u201cin honour of what it probably will remain to the reader.\u201d Grounding his play in the Old Testament and 18th-century rationalism, Byron challenged accepted religious beliefs in good, evil, death, and immortality.\nAdam and Eve inhabit a postlapsarian world with their sons, Cain and Abel; daughters, Adah (Cain\u2019s twin) and Zillah; and grandchild, Enoch, the son of Cain and Adah. Cain appears as the first skeptic and a Romantic rebel, a blend of the rational and the Promethean, defiantly, even blasphemously questioning his parents\u2019 views of God\u2019s goodness and justice. When God violently rejects his offering of fruit but accepts with gratitude Abel\u2019s animal sacrifice, Cain takes a stand for life, denouncing the death principle behind God\u2019s tyrannical \u201cpleasure\u201d in \u201cThe fumes of scorching flesh and smoking blood. \u201cWith tragic irony Cain then sheds his brother\u2019s blood in the human world\u2019s first death. Remorseful and repentant, he goes into exile accompanied by Adah and Enoch, without railing against an unjust God.\nIn September, amid the confusion of packing for his move to Pisa, Byron took up a poem he had begun in May and immediately set aside. On October\u00a0 4, he completed one of his greatest works, The Vision of Judgment, a satiric riposte to Robert Southey\u2019s A Vision of Judgment, which had appeared in April. This solemn, sycophantic eulogy in limping hexameters commemorates the death, burial, and supposed apotheosis of King George III. In his preface, chiefly concerning the poem\u2019s metrics, Southey virulently attacked Byron (without naming him) as the leader of the \u201cSatanic school\u201d of contemporary writers, whose works mocked religion, represented \u201cloathsome images of atrocities and horrors\u201d and exhibited \u201ca Satanic spirit of pride and audacious impiety.\"\nIn his \u201ctrue dream\u201d or vision, Byron, under the pseudonym \u201cQuevedo Redivivus,\u201d trains his telescope on \u201cthe celestial gate\u201d to espy the truth about George III\u2019s arrival there for judgment. He discovers that, during the mayhem caused by Southey\u2019s reading from his Vision of Judgment, the decrepit king simply \u201cslipped into Heaven.\u201d Byron\u2019s hatred of oppression finds a worthy target in George III, whom Satan indicts as a warmonger and a symbol of tyranny in England, America, and Europe. Byron also directs his spite at Southey\u2019s poetry and politics: \u201cHe had written much blank verse, and blanker prose, / And more of both than any body knows.\u201d A political apostate, Southey began as an exponent of revolutionary views, only to become a voice of conservative reaction: this \u201chearty antijacobin\u201d had \u201cturned his coat\u2014and would have turned his skin.\"\nByron based Heaven and Earth, the \u201cMystery\u201d he began in October, on Genesis 6:1-2, which records that the \u201csons of God\u201d (to Byron, angels) took as wives \u201cthe daughters of men\u201d (women descended from Cain, who were condemned to destruction in the Flood). Through Japhet, the elect but troubled son of Noah, Byron questions the doctrine of predestination, which had disturbed him all his life. As in Cain, this drama asks why evil exists, since Jehovah is good. Aholibamah, one of the women, articulates the familiar Byronic theme of human aspiration for celestial existence free from the limitations of the body: \u201cwhere is the impiety of loving / Celestial natures?\u201d (I.i).\nIn Pisa, which he reached in November, Byron was drawn into a delightful circle of friends that included Percy and Mary Shelley, Edward and Jane Williams, and Shelley\u2019s cousin Thomas Medwin. They were joined in mid January by the flamboyant adventurer Edward John Trelawny.\nOn December 19 Murray published Sardanapalus, The Two Foscari, and Cain in a single volume. In a letter written January\u00a0 26, 1822, Shelley proclaimed Cain \u201capocalyptic\u2014it is a revelation not before communicated to man.\u201d His was a minority opinion.\u00a0 To John Gibson Lockhart, Cain was \u201ca wicked and blasphemous performance.\u201d To the Gentleman\u2019s Magazine, the play was \u201cneither more nor less than a series of wanton libels upon the Supreme Being and His attributes.\u201d Few critics embraced Sardanapalus and fewer still The Two Foscari.\nByron had placed his daughter Allegra in a convent school in Bagnacavallo in March 1821; on April 20, 1822 she died there at the age of five, after a brief illness. Following Byron\u2019s instructions, she was buried in Harrow Church.\nIn July, the poet, critic, and editor Leigh Hunt accepted Shelley\u2019s year-old invitation, extended in Byron\u2019s name, to come to Pisa with his family to help edit a new literary journal. Despite Shelley\u2019s death in July, plans went forward to start The Liberal: Verse and Prose from the South, to be published in London by Hunt\u2019s brother, John. Byron contributed to each of its four issues published in 1822 and 1823.\nHe was also proceeding rapidly with Don Juan. After the erotic seraglio scenes in the sixth canto, he began to exhibit a new gravity. His satire on war and its false glory fills Cantos VII and VIII, on the siege of Ismail. In late September, the remnants of the Pisan Circle relocated to Genoa. Within a week of his arrival, Byron had completed the 10th canto of Don Juan, which carries the hero to England, and started the 11th, with its satire on the shallowness and hypocrisy of the English aristocracy.\nThe first number of The Liberal appeared in mid-October, leading with Byron\u2019s Vision of Judgment. Though published under a pseudonym and without the explanatory preface, the satire was immediately recognized as Byron\u2019s and deplored as slanderous, seditious, and impious. John Hunt was prosecuted for libeling the late king; he remained the publisher of The Liberal but turned printing duties over to the less radical printer C. H. Reynell.\nMurray found Don Juan, Cantos VI, VII, and VIII \u201cso outrageously shocking\u201d that he refused to publish them. Byron responded by withdrawing from Murray and turning to John Hunt as his publisher. Then, between December and January 1823 he composed a slashing satire, The Age of Bronze (published by John Hunt in 1823). As the title suggests, Byron voices disillusionment with the modern era, his targets being both political and economic.\nIn the summer of 1823 he told his guest \u201cthe most gorgeous\u201d Marguerite, Countess of Blessington, that \u201che who is only a poet has done little for mankind\"; he would therefore \u201cendeavour to prove in his own person that a poet may be a soldier.\u201d To this end he devoted himself to the Greek War of Independence from the Turks, begun in March 1821. In May he was elected to the London Greek Committee, recently formed to aid the struggling insurgents. After a reluctant farewell to Teresa, he made good on his offer of personal assistance to the patriots by sailing from Genoa on July 16, bound for Leghorn and Greece. He was accompanied by Pietro Gamba, Trelawny, and a considerable sum of money and medical supplies for the Greek cause; he also packed gold and scarlet uniforms and heroic helmets for their landing on Greek shores. On August 3, they reached the island of Cephalonia, then under British protection. Byron did not immediately commit himself to any faction, preferring to wait for signs of unity in the Greek effort. Intent on the war, he gave no time to poetry, adding nothing to the stanzas of Don Juan, Canto XVII, he had started in Genoa.\nUnknown to him, John Hunt published Don Juan, Cantos VI, VII, and VIII in July. In the July 1823 issue of Blackwood\u2019s Magazine, \u201cTimothy Tickler\u201d (William Maginn) attacked them as \u201cmere filth\u201d for abusing chastity, matrimony, monarchy, and lawful government. In the September issue of Blackwood\u2019s \u201cOdoherty\u201d (John Gibson Lockhart) maintained that Cantos IX, X, and XI were, \u201cwithout exception, the first of Lord Byron\u2019s works,\u201d containing the finest specimens of his serious poetry and of contemporary \u201cludicrous poetry\"; Don Juan was \u201cdestined to hold a permanent rank\u201d in British literature.\nIn November Byron agreed to loan 4,000 pounds to the Greek fleet for its activation. In January 1824 he joined the moderate leader Prince Alexander Mavrokord\u00e1tos on the mainland in swampy Missolonghi. Wearing his red military uniform, Byron was enthusiastically welcomed by shouts, salutes, and salvos, and hailed as a \u201cMessiah.\u201d On the eve of his birthday, he turned once more to poetry to express his feelings on his life and the principles of freedom; the 10 stanzas of \u201cOn This Day I Complete My Thirty-Sixth Year\u201d constitute one of his last poems. Over the next three and a half months, all occasions\u2014military, political, physical, climatic, and amorous\u2014seemed to conspire against him: his leadership of a planned attack on the Turkish stronghold at Lepanto was postponed for lack of soldiers; factions still prevented a unified war effort; his constitution, weakened by years of dieting to combat congenital portliness, deteriorated under the constant strain and the cold winter rains in Missolonghi; the emotional frustration of his unrequited love for his handsome 15-year-old page boy, Loukas Chalandritsanos, seems to have inspired his final poem (posthumously titled and published as \u201cLove and Death\u201d) which concludes, \u201cNor can I blame thee, though it be my lot / To strongly, wrongly, vainly love thee still.\u201d Despite uncertainty and reverses, he continued to commit money and energy to Mavrokord\u00e1tos and the Greek cause.\nIn March 1824, John and H.L. Hunt published the last complete sections of Don Juan, Cantos XV and XVI. The Literary Gazette pronounced them \u201cdestitute of the least glimmering of talent\u201d and a \u201cwretched\u201d \u201cpiece of stuff altogether.\"\nOn April 9, having been soaked by a heavy rain while out riding, Byron suffered fever and rheumatic pains. By the 12th he was seriously ill. Repeated bleedings further debilitated him. On Easter Sunday, he entered a comatose state. At six o\u2019clock on the evening of Easter Monday, April 19, 1824, during a violent electrical storm, Byron died.\nIn memorial services throughout the country, he was proclaimed a national hero of Greece. His death proved effective in uniting Greece against the enemy and in eliciting support for its struggle from all parts of the civilized world. In October 1827 British, French, and Russian forces destroyed the Turkish and Egyptian fleets at Navarino, assuring Greek independence, which was acknowledged by the sultan in 1829.\nByron\u2019s body arrived in England on June 29, and for two days lay in state in a house in Great George Street, London. On Friday, 16 July 1824, Lord Byron was buried in the family vault beneath the chancel of Hucknall Torkard Church near Newstead Abbey.\nThe fame to which Byron awoke in London in 1812 was spread rapidly throughout Europe and the English-speaking world by scores of translations and editions. His influence was pervasive and prolonged. Alfred de Musset was his disciple in France, Alexander Pushkin in Russia, Heinrich Heine in Germany, Adam Mickiewicz in Poland. His poetry inspired musical compositions by Hector Berlioz, Robert Schumann, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky; operas by Gaetano Donizetti and Giuseppe Verdi; and paintings by J.M.W. Turner, John Martin, Ford Madox Brown, and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. His spirit animated liberal revolutionary movements: most of the officers executed following the unsuccessful 1825 Decembrist uprising in Russia were Byronists; the Italian patriot Giuseppe Mazzini associated Byron with the eternal struggle of the oppressed to be free. Shelley, Heine, and others adopted Byron\u2019s open-necked shirt, which he wears in Thomas Phillips\u2019s striking 1814 painting.\nPhilosophically and stylistically, Byron stands apart from the other major Romantics. He was the least insular, the most cosmopolitan of them. Poetic imagination was not for him, as for them, the medium of revelation of ultimate truth. He wished that Coleridge would \u201cexplain his Explanation\u201d of his thought. He did not embrace for long Wordsworth\u2019s belief in the benevolence of nature, espouse Shelley\u2019s faith in human perfectibility, or experience Keats\u2019s private vision. Yet, as Leslie A. Marchand observes, \u201cThe core of his thinking and the basis of his poetry is romantic aspiration,\u201d and he evidences a \u201cromantic zest for life and experience.\u201d In narrative skill, Byron has no superior in English poetry, save Geoffrey Chaucer; as Ronald Bottrall notes, Byron, like his illustrious predecessor, could \u201csum up a society and an era.\u201d His subjects are fundamental ones: life and death, growth and decay, humankind and nature.\u00a0 His \u201capotheosis of the commonplace\u201d is, to Edward E. Bostetter, \u201cone of his great contributions to the language of poetry.\u201d Lacking the inhibitions of his contemporaries, Byron created verse that is exuberant, spontaneous, expansive, digressive, concrete, lucid, colloquial\u2014in celebration of \u201cunadorned reality.\u201d\n\"I was born for opposition,\u201d Byron proclaimed in Don Juan, Canto XV. The outstanding elements of his poetry both support his self-analysis and insure his enduring reputation. As a major political and social satirist, he repeatedly denounces war, tyranny, and hypocrisy. As an untiring champion of liberty, he firmly believed that \u201cRevolution / Alone can save the earth from hell\u2019s pollution\u201d, a tenet he defended with his life.\nThe last word properly belongs to Byron, who\u00a0 captured his essence in Canto IV of Childe Harold:\n\nBut I have lived, and have not lived in vain:\r\nMy mind may lose its force, my blood its fire,\r\nAnd my frame perish even in conquering pain,\r\nBut there is that within me which shall tire\r\nTorture and Time, and breathe when I expire [.]\n\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Romantic"]}}
