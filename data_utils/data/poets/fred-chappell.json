He attended Duke University, where he befriended fellow writers Anne Tyler, Reynolds Price, and James Applewhite. The author of numerous books of poetry, fiction, and critical prose, Chappell has received many awards for his work, including the T.S. Eliot Prize, the Bollingen Prize, the Aiken Taylor Award, an award from the National Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Best Foreign Book Prize from the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise. He was named North Carolina poet laureate in 1997, a position he held until 2002.\nDrawing on childhood memories and the character of his home region, Chappell\u2019s poetry and prose investigates Southern experience. His early novels were sometimes described as \u201cSouthern Gothic,\u201d and he was seen as part of a tradition that included William Faulkner and Flannery O\u2019Connor. In novels like It Is Time, Lord (1963), The Inkling (1965), and Dagon (1968), which won the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s Prix de Meilleur des Lettres \u00c9trangers, Chappell explores madness, violence, and even horror. His later cycle of interconnected short stories, The Kirkman Tetralogy, which included volumes such as I Am One of You Forever (1985) and Farewell, I\u2019m Bound to Leave You (1996), focuses on personal experience, layering fiction with some of the facts and circumstances of Chappell\u2019s own life. Chappell\u2019s fiction has been widely praised, and he is frequently linked to a Southern tradition of writers. Writing in the Los Angeles Times Book Review, Frank Levering stated,\u00a0\u201cNot since James Agee and Robert Penn Warren has a Southern writer displayed such masterful versatility. Together with only a handful of his American contemporaries, Chappell reminds us of the almost forgotten phrase \u2018man of letters.\u2019\u201d\nThough Chappell first gained critical attention for his prose, he has since become widely known as a poet. His first collection of poetry, The World Between the Eyes (1971), won the Roanoke-Chowan Poetry Cup. Of his shift from prose to poetry, Chappell told Contemporary Authors, \u201cNow for the first time I could begin to think directly about the most important intellectual and artistic endeavor in the world: the composition of poetry.\u201d Other early collections of poetry include The Man Twice Married to Fire (1977) and Awakening to Music (1979). One of Chappell\u2019s most ambitious works is Midquest (1981), \u201ca four-volume poetic autobiography,\u201d as the poet himself described it. Prior to its release as a single volume in 1981, the work was published in four separate volumes\u2014River, Bloodfire, Wind Mountain, and Earthsleep\u2014between the years 1975 and 1980. Chappell has published many collections of poetry since Midquest, including As If It Were (2019), Shadowbox (2009), Backsass (2004), Family Gathering (2000), and Spring Garden: New and Selected Poems (1995).\nThe Fred Chappell Reader (1987) contains selections from the author\u2019s poetry, short stories, and novels, including the entire text of Dagon. For several critics, the volume presents Chappell as an uncommonly talented writer in several genres. Reviewing the book for the Washington Post Book World, Frederick Busch called Chappell a \u201cwriter of breadth and distinction.\u201d The Reader also highlights the similarities in Chappell\u2019s work, whatever the genre. Busch argued that, \u201cChappell in his work as a whole examines dreams, fears and the particular beauties of his native North Carolina with a country kid\u2019s instinct for what\u2019s before him, and a metaphysician\u2019s squint at what lies far beyond such beautiful harshness.\u201d\nChappell\u2019s essay collections include Plow Naked: Selected Essays on Poetry (1993) and A Way of Happening: Observations of Contemporary Poetry (1998). For over 40 years, he taught at the University of North Carolina\u2013Greensboro, where he helped establish the MFA in writing program and received the O. Max Gardner Award for teaching. Retired from teaching, he lives with his wife Susan in North Carolina.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"]}}
