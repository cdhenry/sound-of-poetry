After earning an MA in literature from San Francisco State University, Gander moved to Mexico, then to Arkansas, where his poetry\u2014informed by his knowledge of geology\u2014turned its attention to landscape as foreground or source of action.\n\r\nGander\u2019s books of poetry include\u00a0Be With\u00a0(2018), which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize,\u00a0Eye Against Eye\u00a0(2005),\u00a0Torn Awake\u00a0(2001), and\u00a0Science & Steepleflower\u00a0(1998). Critic Barbara Fischer wrote in the\u00a0Boston Review\u00a0that Gander\u2019s poetry \u201cmarshals a sinewy and strenuous language for familial, sensory, and erotic experience.\u201d A master of the long poem, Gander uses the form to consider his subjects from a variety of approaches, and as the proving ground for unique formal constraints. Of\u00a0Be With,\u00a0Gander\u2019s series of elegies for his wife, the poet\u00a0C.D. Wright,\u00a0Dan Chiasson\u00a0noted in the\u00a0New Yorker: \u201cThe book\u2019s sputtering, flinching style, with its syntactical dead ends and missed connections, feels like both an accommodation to the necessity of language and proof of its inadequacy.\u201d\n\r\nThough primarily a poet, Gander is also a translator, novelist, essayist, and the editor of several\u00a0anthologies. He has translated collections by Mexican poets\u00a0Pura L\u00f3pez Colom\u00e9\u00a0and\u00a0Coral Bracho. With Kent Johnson he translated Bolivian poet Jaime Saenz\u2019s\u00a0Immanent Visitor: Selected Poems of Jamie Saenz\u00a0and\u00a0The Night\u00a0(2007), for which he won a PEN Translation Award. His translations of Neruda are collected in\u00a0Then Come Back: The Lost Neruda Poems\u00a0(2016) and included in\u00a0The Essential Neruda: Selected Poems\u00a0(2004). He also edited the bilingual anthologies\u00a0Mouth to Mouth: Poems by Twelve Contemporary Mexican Women\u00a0(1993) and Pinholes in the Night: Essential Poems from Latin America (with Ra\u00fal Zaurita, 2014). Gander\u2019s own poetry has been translated into several languages. He is the author of two novels, As a Friend (2008) and The Trace (2015).\n\r\nGander has won the Whiting Writers\u2019 Award, a Howard Foundation Award, the Jessica Nobel Maxwell Memorial Prize, two\u00a0Gertrude Stein\u00a0Awards for innovative North American writing, and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, and United States Artists. He has taught at Harvard University and Brown University.\nWith\u00a0Wright,\u00a0Gander coedited the literary small press Lost Roads Publishers for 20 years. He now lives in northern California.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
