He was educated at the \u00c9cole Nationale de la France d\u2019Outre-Mer in Paris, where he became friends with Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire and future French president George Pompidou. After earning his French citizenship, Senghor taught in Tours and Paris. He joined the French army during World War II and spent 18 months in a German prison camp. After serving successive terms representing Senegal in the French National Assembly, Senghor returned to his native land, where he led his nation\u2019s independence movement in 1960. He eventually became Senegal\u2019s first democratically elected president, a post which he held for the next twenty years.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSenghor\u2019s political and literary careers were inextricably linked. Residing part-time in France, he wrote poems of resistance in French which engaged his Catholic spirituality even as they celebrated his Senegalese heritage. Senghor is the author of several collections of poetry, including Chants d\u2019ombre (1945), Nocturnes (1961), and The Collected Poetry (1991, translated by Melvin Dixon). He also edited an anthology of work by African poets in French colonies, Anthologie de la Nouvelle Po\u00e9sie N\u00e9gre et Malagache (1945, with an introduction by Jean-Paul Sartre). His nonfiction work includes numerous volumes on politics, philosophy, sociology, and linguistics.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSenghor co-founded, with Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, the N\u00e9gritude movement, which promotes distinctly African cultural values and aesthetics, in opposition to the influence of French colonialism and European exploitation. He also co-founded the journal Presence Africaine with Alione Diop. Senghor, the first African invited to join the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, was awarded honorary doctorates from 37 universities, in addition to many other literary honors.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSenghor died at his home in France at the age of 95.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Africa"]}}
