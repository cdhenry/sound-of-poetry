Hausermann. And, in Henry Treece\u2019s view, as a poet Read \u201crepresented more phases of human recognition than any other writer living today.\u201d Read combined his sharpness of perception with his commitment to \u201csearching life at a very great depth\u201d to produce writing after writing in a career that spanned six decades. \u201cOnly [Ezra] Pound\u2019s creative lifetime,\u201d wrote Marius Bewley, \u201chas been longer and more representative in our time.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nCritics have cited several distinct traits in Read\u2019s poems. Like Hausermann\u2019s response to Read\u2019s criticism, Bewley believed \u201cone cannot read the... Collected Poems without a sharp awareness of the writer\u2019s informed intelligence.\u201d Read also wrote a distinctively modern verse, with Imagism being, in Kathleen Raine\u2019s analysis, \u201cthe first of several movements with which Herbert Read was to associate himself. From the regionalism which inspired his first and enduring poetic loyalty to Wordsworth he moved... into the American expatriate ethos which ... introduced into English letters that internationalism which changed, perhaps permanently, the course of its native current.\u201d James Dickey commented further on the influence of Wordsworth when he said: \u201cThe poems I think of most persuasively as Read\u2019s (\u2018A World Within a War,\u2019 \u2018Moon\u2019s Farm\u2019) are about land, and its relationship to those who live on it. These poems have more of the feudal (and older) sense of belonging to the land than any I know since Wordsworth\u2019s.\n\r\nRead\u2019s development as a poet, critic, and thinker owed itself to the influence of several important mentors. Besides Wordsworth, other poets in his literary tradition, most of them Imagists, included T.E. Hulme, F.S. Flint, Pound, H.D., Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams, and his lifetime friend and closest literary associate, T.S. Eliot. As a critic, Read depended heavily upon Coleridge\u2019s Biographia Literaria, as well as the Letters of John Keats. Among others who shaped Read\u2019s mind (long known for its anarchist convictions) are John Ruskin, Sigmund Freud, Soren Kierkegaard, and Carl Jung.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhile the intellectual aspects of Read\u2019s poetry are apparent, some feel this quality has adversely affected his presentation. \u201cThere is too much of the will, here [in Moon\u2019s Farm], and not enough of the carrying flow of passion,\u201d argued Dickey. \u201cRead\u2019s verse has over it, still, a strong cast of the would-be poet, the straining articulateness of the amateur.\u201d Geoffrey Moore also recognized a burdening will when he declared: \u201cYet for all his hard work and seriousness Sir Herbert has, but for a handful of poems, always seemed more of a thinker expressing himself in verse than a true poet.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nCritics agree that Read evinced a different character as a poet than as a critic. In a 1926 review of a critical work, Reason and Romanticism, D.S. Mirsky claimed \u201cRead is an anti-Romantic and a champion of the intellectual revival.\u201d But others have shared the view that Read is \u201canti-romantic in his criticism only.\u201d \u201cRead divided his activities between the spontaneous, lyrical approach of the poet and the logical, discursive approach of the essayist,\u201d wrote George Woodcock. \u201cHis views on poetry tended to the romantic; his practice in prose was inclined to the classical.\u201d Graham Greene, too, noticed the distinction, and seemed more moved by his \u201ccreative\u201d work: \u201cThe result of separating Mr. Read\u2019s creative from his critical work has an odd effect\u2014there is color, warmth, glow, the passion which surrounds the \u2018sense of glory,\u2019 and we seem far removed from the rather dry critic with his eyes fixed on the distinctions between the ego and the id.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nRead\u2019s criticism has surprised many because of its tolerance. Raine saw Read\u2019s open-armed approach to others\u2019 works bound in a desire to \u201crelate his criticism to system after system. Under the compulsive necessity always to have a theory, he was almost naively uncritical of ideas as long as they were new.\u201d John Berger, meanwhile, looked for explanations in his personality: \u201cIf he is over-tolerant towards nonsense, it is because he credits everyone with his own sincerity.\u201d Treece also felt Read\u2019s critical attitude rested in \u201chis very nature, his lability, his tolerance and breadth... . For Read\u2019s humility is only the obverse of his honest solidity; it is the humanity of the man who can recognise, probe and still respect the multiplicity of the world in which he walks.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nThough Read concentrated mainly on poetry and criticism, one of his most widely read books is a novel. Worth T. Harder considered The Green Child a \u201cmasterpiece, a work as extraordinary now as it was when first published in 1935. Seductive, complex, self-contained, it appears at once to invite and to forbid analysis... . What seems to have happened in The Green Child was that he combined his ideas in such unexpected ways and embodied them in a fantasy so entrancing as to render his readers unable or unwilling to grasp the meaning of his allegory. Yet it is the matching of image with idea in this work that is, finally, most extraordinary of all.\u201d Similarly, Woodcock thought it \u201cno ordinary novel\u201d and \u201cfull of intrinsic symbolic suggestiveness.\u201d He also felt that although by nature Read was more a poet and essayist than a novelist, \u201cThe Green Child would not have been the small and unique classic it has now become if Read had not used in writing it his poet\u2019s complex sensitivity to words and the essayists power to control and manipulate ideas.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nRead\u2019s ultimate contribution as a writer lay in his \u201creasonable romantic championship of art to others,\u201d praised David D. Harvey. He believed art to be a seminal force in education and industry, as exemplified by such works as Art and Industry and The Redemption of the Robot: My Encounter With Education Through Art. Woodcock believed Read\u2019s most influential book, Education Through Art, succeeded in this way because it reached beyond his special audience and \u201cinfluenced many of the very people he had hoped to convert\u2014the teachers and the instructors in colleges of education.\u201d In his lifetime Read saw Britain\u2019s Society of Education Through Art and an International Society for Education Through Art founded on the basis of his work, but these accomplishments formed only a foundation for his great hope. As Woodcock emphasized, \u201cRead died believing that his philosophy of life\u2014the aesthetic philosophy\u2014was valid, and that some day, if the world was not destroyed by technicians, mankind would come to live by it, through true education and a life in which work and art would become indistinguishable.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
