He published six collections of poetry during his lifetime: Nine Iridescent Figures on a Vase (1978), Peru (1983), Afghanistan (1984), Dream Palace (1986), The Little Voices of the Pears (1989), and What Was Lost (2000).His blank verse poetry uses extended dramatic monologue or meditation and is both expansive and dense. Poet Anthony Hecht noted that Morris wrote \u201cwith the precise qualifications of Henry James, and conveys the muted but implicit drama of Edward Hopper.\u201d Morris was the recipient of both a Lannan Literary Fellowship for Poetry and a Lannan Literary Award for Poetry. He died in 2001.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {}}
