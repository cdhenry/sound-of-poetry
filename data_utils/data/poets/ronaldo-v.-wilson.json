Discussing poetry\u2019s role in the American imagination, especially as a tool to combat powerful, persistent ideas about race, the body, and trauma, Wilson told Elizabeth Hildreth in Bookslut, \u201cI love poetry for allowing the tools with which one can capture, create and perform such an experience for the reader that tests the shifting limits of trauma by mapping out the power arrangements in such an encounter between human beings.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nWilson is the author of the collections Poems of the Black Object (2009), winner of the Asian American Literary Award in Poetry and the Publishing Triangle\u2019s Thom Gunn Award, and Narrative of the Life of the Brown Boy and the White Man (2008).

Harris, Wilson cofounded the performance-based Black Took Collective.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
