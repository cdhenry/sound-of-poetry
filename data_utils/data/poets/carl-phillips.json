He was born in Everett, Washington in 1959, and his family moved frequently around the United States. He earned a BA from Harvard, an MAT from the University of Massachusetts, and an MA in creative writing from Boston University. Before teaching English at the university level, he taught Latin at several high schools. He is Professor of English at Washington University in St. Louis, where he also teaches creative writing. Phillips was elected a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets in 2006, and since 2011 he has served as the judge for the Yale Series of Younger Poets.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPhillips\u2019s most recent books of poetry are\u00a0Pale Colors in a Tall Field\u00a0(2020),\u00a0Wild Is the Wind (2018), Reconnaissance (2015),\u00a0Silverchest\u00a0(2013, nominated for the Griffin Prize),\u00a0Double Shadow\u00a0(2011, winner\u00a0Los Angeles Times\u00a0Book Prize for Poetry and\u00a0finalist for the National Book Award), and Speak Low\u00a0(2009, finalist for the National Book Award). His other books include Quiver of Arrows: Selected Poems, 1986-2006, Riding Westward (2006), The Rest of Love (2004), and Rock Harbor (2002).\u00a0\n\r\nPhillips has also published works of criticism and translation. Graywolf Press has published two collections of his essays:\u00a0The Art of Daring: Risk, Restlessness, Imagination (2014) and\u00a0Coin of the Realm: Essays on the Life and Art of Poetry (2004). Oxford University Press published Phillips\u2019s\u00a0translation of Sophocles\u2019s\u00a0Philoctetes\u00a0(2003).\r\n\u00a0\r\nA classicist by training, Phillips often employs classical forms and makes allusions to classical literature, art, and music. While in his teens, Phillips began to write poetry. \u201cI was a nerdy kid,\u201d he told Lawrence Biemiller in the\u00a0Chronicle of Higher Education.\u00a0\u201cMaybe it has to do with creating your own world. For some people it\u2019s easier to create a world that you can rely on, that travels with you.\u201d Phillips entered Harvard University on a scholarship, where he studied Latin and Greek. For a long time he did not write any poetry, but in 1990, while coming to terms with his identity as a gay man, he rediscovered his poetic voice.\n\r\n\u2028\u2028Phillips received critical acclaim early in his career. His debut book\u00a0In the Blood\u00a0was the winner of the Samuel French Morse Poetry Prize in 1992.\u00a0Alfred Corn, writing in the\u00a0Kenyon Review,\u00a0described the style of\u00a0In the Blood\u00a0as metamorphic: \u201cAs with symbolism, words are used in associative rather than logical ways, constantly shifting ground and modulating context so that the central subject is never made baldly explicit. The poems (most of them) will support several interpretations, though no single interpretation perfectly.\u201d\n\r\nA decade later, Phillips\u2019s collections Pastoral\u00a0(2000) and\u00a0The Tether\u00a0(2001, winner of\u00a0the Kingsley Tuft Poetry Award) were also well received in critical circles. The poetry in Pastoral continues to \u201cecho the sorrow, alienation and eros of bodily existence,\u201d summarized a\u00a0Publishers Weekly\u00a0critic, who called the work \u201cbrilliant.\u201d Philip Clark in\u00a0Lambda Book Report\u00a0argued that the poems in\u00a0Pastoral\u00a0are written in a style different from Phillips\u2019s previous collections; they are \u201cmore daring than anything Phillips has tried previously, and when they work, the poems create a pleasantly disorienting effect.\u201d Tina Barr in the\u00a0Boston Review\u00a0found the poems in the collection \u201cself-reflexive, musical, referential, educated, and passionate.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nWriting on Double Shadow (2011) in the Chicago Tribune,\u00a0Troy Jollimore said, \u201cthe perpetually shifting textures and shardlike quality of Phillips\u2019 language are reminiscent of John Ashbery.\u201d Unlike Ashbery\u2019s playful universe, \u201cPhillips\u2019 is a somber, autumnal landscape, one that is illuminated by moments of ephemeral, ethereal beauty.\u201d Jenny Mueller, reviewing\u00a0Speak Low,\u00a0wrote that the work \u201cbrings echoes to the reader's ear of such 20th-century eminences as Wallace Stevens, John Ashbery, T.S. Eliot and Rainer Maria Rilke. As in Rilke, Phillips\u2019 lines give his language a near-sculptural form, something like a fountain. The poems are structures of alternating firmness and give, as the sense spills from line to line.\u201d\n\r\nOf Phillips\u2019s more recent collections, Joseph Campana has written, \u201cSilverchest\u00a0displays the gifts of an exceptional talent with palpable staying power. The lyrics often manage to combine a disarming speaker, elegant syntax and startling titles that index powerful acts of mind.\u201d In the Washington Post, Elizabeth Lund said of Wild Is the Wind: \u201cThe writing dazzles with transcendent metaphors, complex connections and linguistic flourishes. It also draws on some familiar Phillips motifs\u2014navigation and the sea, the sky and land\u2014to explore the possibility that love can bring both stability and freedom.\u201d\nPhillips\u2019s honors include fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the Library of Congress. He is the recipient of the Academy of American Poets Fellowship, an Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Academy of American Poets Prize, and a Pushcart Prize, and he has been inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Phillips lives in St. Louis, Missouri. \u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
