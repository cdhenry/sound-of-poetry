Dickey was born in Bellingham, Washington, and grew up in Washington and Oregon. He earned his BA from Reed College, an MA from Harvard University and attended Oxford University on a Fulbright scholarship. He earned his MFA from the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. Dickey began his teaching career at Cornell and Denison Universities before joining the faculty at San Francisco State, where he taught for almost 30 years. Dickey\u2019s many collections of poetry included Of the Festivity (1959), selected by W.H. Auden for the Yale Series of Younger Poets, More under Saturn (1971), The Rainbow Grocery (1971), which received the Juniper Prize, In the Dreaming: Selected Poems (1994), and The Education of Desire (1996).\n\r\nBrown Miller, writing in the San Francisco Review of Books, called Dickey \u201ca national treasure,\u201d although he remained largely unknown even to dedicated followers of contemporary poetry. The reasons for Dickey\u2019s relative obscurity, as Miller noted, were that the poet \u201cworks harder on the writing of his work than the promoting of it, does only three or four readings a year, and often prefers to publish his poetry with small, independent presses whose books are lovingly crafted works of art in their own right.\u201d Dickey\u2019s talent, however, was not unknown to critics; in his introduction to Of the Festivity, Auden noted that great poetry contains a personal vision conveyed in lines that have \u201cthe power to speak\u201d as they record keen observations, and that Dickey\u2019s poems satisfy these criteria. \u201cThe critical consensus about the volume supports Auden\u2019s judgment \u2026 [that] many of the poems are great,\u201d Thomas Goldstein reported in the Dictionary of Literary Biography. He felt that Dickey\u2019s humor and seriousness achieve an \u201cequilibrium\u201d in Of the Festivity.\n\r\nSome reviewers noted that in later books the balance tipped toward the darker, sometimes nightmarish elements of Dickey\u2019s personal vision. Humor became sardonic in the poet\u2019s fourth collection, observed Goldstein. Hudson Review contributor Vernon Young also believed Dickey was \u201cbest when firmly confronting the public condition with serene loathing\u2026or, alternatively, treasuring the private hour, reverent, but skeptical.\u201d Writing in Parnassus, Paul Zweig acknowledged this distance, but praised the poet\u2019s \u201cwillingness to entertain difficult ideas.\u201d Abstract ideas often function successfully as theme in the poems, and for this reason, readers \u201cmay tend to miss the earth in them,\u201d commented John R. Reed in a Poetry magazine review. Dickey received a silver medal from the Commonwealth Club of California for More under Saturn in 1972.\n\nThe Rainbow Grocery, winner of the 1978 Juniper Prize from the University of Massachusetts Press, and The Sacrifice Consenting (1981) were also generally well-received. Poems in The Rainbow Grocery \u201care more loosely constructed, more sexual, and more frenzied\u201d than poems in Of the Festivity; \u201ccynicism has overcome the humor,\u201d and \u201cthe terrors of the subconscious have overcome the rational mind\u201d in these poems, Goldstein believes. For others such as Robert B. Shaw, however, the jesting and despair maintain a precarious balance. When so poised, comments Shaw in Poetry, \u201cDickey writes a rare and enviable sort of poem, truly humorous and truly serious at once.\u201d Miller concurred: \u201cIn his work generally and in The King of the Golden River and Brief Lives [both published in 1985] specifically, [Dickey] integrates insight and feeling to an outstanding degree,\u201d achieving gracefulness of phrase without \u201csacrificing a raw, gutsy contact with reality.\u201d\nDickey lived much of his adult life in San Francisco with his long-time companion, the poet Leonard Sanazaro. He died from HIV-related complications in 1994.\n", "attrs": {}}
