She earned her BA at the University of Pennsylvania, MA at Temple University, and MFA at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Goldstein is influenced by Modernists such as Gertrude Stein as well as the postmodern avant-garde, and her work frequently engages performance. \u201cI really value experience in the moment and how it can change you in ways you don\u2019t realize,\u201d she says in an interview with Laura Madeline Wiseman. \u201cI also attempt to create that kind of nebulous space on the page and by provoking the more uncanny effects of language.\u201d With Jennifer Karmin, Goldstein co-curates the Red Rover Reading Series in Chicago. She is a lecturer at Loyola University and lives in Chicago.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
