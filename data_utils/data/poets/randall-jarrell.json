As a child, he spent time in Los Angeles, where his grandparents lived, and he would later write movingly about the city in \u201cThe Lost World,\u201d one of his best-known poems. Jarrell\u2019s collections of poetry included Blood for a Stranger (1942), two collections based on his experiences as an Air Force training navigator in World War II\u2014Little Friend, Little Friend (1945) and Losses (1948)\u2014and the highly acclaimed The Woman at the Washington Zoo (1960), which won the National Book Award, and The Lost World (1965). A volume of Complete Poems (1969) was published posthumously. In his later poetry, Jarrell frequently adopted the personae of women, crafting narratives of ordinary life and domestic constraint in what Karl Shapiro called \u201cthe common dialogue of Americans.\u201d Jarrell was also known as one of the most perceptive, erudite, and feared critics of midcentury American poetry. His essays were collected in the volumes Poetry and the Age (1953) and Kipling, Auden & Co. (1980). He also published a satirical campus novel, Pictures from an Institution (1954), translations of Chekov, Goethe, and the Grimm Brothers, as well as a number of children\u2019s books during his lifetime.\nJarrell earned his BA from Vanderbilt University, studying with poets associated with the \u201cFugitive\u201d movement of Southern writing including John Crowe Ransom and Robert Penn Warren. But according to William Pritchard, \u201cJarrell showed little interest in Fugitive or \u2018Southern\u2019 political and cultural ideas. His early poetry, some of it published while he was still an undergraduate, is apocalyptic, surreal, and humourless\u2014much indebted to Auden's example, though lacking Auden's wit and formal brilliance.\u201d Jarrell followed Ransom, his mentor, to Kenyon College where he roomed with the young Robert Lowell and read in manuscript the poems that would become Lord Weary\u2019s Castle. Lowell was to be one of the poets\u2014along with Elizabeth Bishop, W.H. Auden, Marianne Moore, and Robert Frost\u2014that Jarrell wrote about most often. Jarrell taught at the University of Texas, joined the Air Force during World War II, and published fierce reviews of contemporary poetry in journals such as the New Republic and the Nation. After the war, he taught at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro until his death in 1965. Jarrell\u2019s final years were marked by struggles with mental illness and at least one suicide attempt. Though his death\u2014he was hit by a car at dusk\u2014was ruled accidental, it occurred during a period of emotional turmoil and, as Pritchard notes, \u201cthe circumstances will never be entirely clear.\u201d\nJarrell was noted for his acerbic, witty, and erudite criticism. In a volume of essays titled Randall Jarrell, 1914-1965, nearly all of the writers praised his critical faculties. They also noted, commented Stephen Spender in the New York Review of Books, \u201ca cruel streak in Jarrell when he attacked poets he didn\u2019t like.\u201d Jarrell could be harsh, critics agreed, but his vehemence was a barometer of his love for literature. Robert Lowell wrote in the New York Times Book Review that Jarrell was \u201calmost brutally serious about literature.\u201d Lowell conceded that he was famed for his \u201cmurderous intuitive phrases,\u201d but defended Jarrell by asserting that he took \u201cas much joy in rescuing the reputation of a sleeping good writer as in chloroforming a mediocre one.\u201d And Helen Vendler wrote in the New York Times Book Review that \u201cnobody loved poets more or better than Randall Jarrell\u2014and irony, indifference or superciliousness in the presence of the remarkable seemed to him capital sins\u201d Suzanne Ferguson, in her book Poetry of Randall Jarrell, alleged that his criticism, with standards based on \u201cbroad, deep reading in all kinds of writing,\u201d would \u201cask always, both explicitly and implicitly, whether the poem tells truth about the world; whether it helps the reader see a little farther, a little more clearly the dark and light of his situation.\u201d\n\r\nJarrell tried to guide the reader not just by the content but also the style of his writing. A straightforward approach was as important to Jarrell in his own writing as in that of the writers he reviewed, noted D.J. Enright in Listener: \u201cJust as common feeling informs his best poetry, so what underlies Randall Jarrell\u2019s criticism is common sense\u2014that quality derided by frothy phonies who have failed to notice how uncommon it is\u2014strengthened and clarified by exactly remembered reading, considerable knowledge of what is essential to know, and his own experience in the art of writing.\u201d Jarrell\u2019s insistence on clarity and accessibility in writing alienated him from some academics; his denouncement of the New Criticism set him even further afield. According to Hilton Kramer in New Leader, the advent of the New Criticism \u201cinduced a profound despair over the very nature of the critical vocation, and his response to that despair was to adopt a tone and a method markedly different from the despised weightiness and solemnity he saw overtaking the whole literary enterprise. This change in his critical outlook had the unfortunate effect of depriving Jarrell of a certain seriousness.\u201d Michael Dirda interpreted Jarrell\u2019s stance in a more positive way: \u201cIn a time when criticism was already turning professional and academic, Jarrell spoke as a reader, one who tried to convey his enthusiasm or his disappointment in a book as sharply as he could manage.\u201d\n\r\nJarrell\u2019s passion for clarity extended from his criticism to his poetry. Julian Moynahan asserted in the New York Times Book Review that \u201cJarrell was a master of the modern plain style, the style which in poets like Frost, Hardy, and Philip Larkin (Jarrell\u2019s favorite younger English poet) is used to connect the vicissitudes of ordinary experience with modes of primary feeling which move deep down within, and between, all of us.\u201d Other critics have commented on the \u201ccolloquial, intimate mode of speech\u201d that James Atlas of the American Poetry Review identified with Jarrell; for Karl Shapiro, writing in Book World, it seemed that \u201cwhat Jarrell did was to locate the tone of voice of his time and of his class (the voice of the poet-professor-critic who refuses to surrender his intelligence and his education to the undergraduate mentality).\u201d\n\r\nWhile Jarrell retained his colloquial voice over the years, he did branch out thematically, according to Hugh B. Staples, who asserted in Contemporary Literature that his \u201cdiversity is reflected in the considerable canon of his work.\u201d Ferguson identified Jarrell\u2019s themes as \u201crelatively few and closely related as they evolve through his thirty-year writing career: in the poems of the thirties, the \u2018great Necessity\u2019 of the natural world and the evils of power politics; in the poems of the early forties, the dehumanizing forces of war and ways to escape or recover from these through dreams, mythologizing, or Christian faith; in the poems of the fifties, and continuing into the sixties, loneliness and fear of aging and death, again opposed by the imagination in dreams and works of art; and in some of the last poems, the defeat of Necessity and time through imaginative recovery of one\u2019s own past.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\nWorld War II was a turning point for Jarrell\u2019s poetry. Hayden Carruth wrote in Nation that out of \u201ca considerable bulk of poetry \u2026 the war poems make a distinct, superior unit.\u201d According to Carruth, World War II (in which Jarrell, too old to serve as a combat pilot, served as a pilot instructor) left a dark psychological imprint on his poetry. Carruth noted the stylistic progression: \u201cHis early poems are sometimes mannered or imitative, and often artificially opaque; but from the first, he wrote with ease, and suffered none of the verbal embarrassment customary among young poets. When the war came he already possessed a developed poetic vocabulary and a mastery of forms. Under the shock of war his mannerisms fell away. He began to write with stark, compressed lucidity.\u201d\n\r\nVendler also believed that the war inspired Jarrell to find a new focus for his writing. She wrote in the New York Times Book Review that \u201chis first steady poems date from his experience in the Air Force, when the pity that was his tutelary emotion, the pity that was to link him so irrevocably to Rilke, found a universal scope.\u201d Although \u201cordinarily he resisted any obvious political rhetoric,\u201d according to M. L. Rosenthal in his Randall Jarrell, the subject of war elicited a fervent emotional response from Jarrell, and his impassioned treatment won him an appreciative audience. Robert Weisberg echoed many critics when he wrote in the New York Times Book Review that Jarrell\u2019s poems \u201centered the spirit of the American soldier with \u2026 subtle empathy,\u201d noting that \u201cperhaps his most famous piece of writing is a stark five-line lyric [\u2018The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner\u2019], the ultimate poem of war.\u201d\n\r\nVernon Scannell asserted that the war poem \u201cMail Call\u201d was another example of a work in which Jarrell identified the military\u2019s \u201cinescapable reduction of man to either animal or instrument by the calculated process of military training and by the uniformed civilian\u2019s enforced acceptance of the murderer\u2019s role, the cruel larceny of all sense of personal identity.\u201d To make his point on this subject about which he felt so strongly, Jarrell used powerful language. Jonathan Galassi noted in Poetry Nation that \u201cthe grisly irony reminds one of Auden, an inevitable influence on Jarrell\u2019s work of this period, but there is a horrible closeness to the event which Auden would not have ventured. Jarrell\u2019s best war poems ... are ... rich in dramatic tension, and grounded, as his best work always is, in vivid detail. His ubiquitous generalizations earn their significance from gorgeously terrible descriptions of carnage and fear.\u201d\n\r\nDespite the impact of his images, some critics suggested that Jarrell lost force by making specific incidents serve a general rhetoric, in the kind of \u201cubiquitous generalizations\u201d cited above. A Times Literary Supplement reviewer noted that in his war poetry Jarrell \u201cseldom dealt with the carefully shaped, irreplaceable persons the world had lost. Instead, he wrote about the possible life the men had missed. This vanished futurity could hardly be concrete or particular, and the soldier therefore was too often a case rather than a person.\u201d J. C. Levenson agreed in the Virginia Quarterly Review that \u201cThe Death of the Ball Turret Gunner\u201d \u201cestablishes the matter-of-factness of flak and fight more successfully than it establishes its big generalization about airmen\u2014and boys\u2014as creatures of the State.\u201d Vendler defended Jarrell, writing in the New York Times Book Review that \u201cit has been charged that Jarrell\u2019s poetry of the war shows no friends, only, in James Dickey\u2019s words, \u2018killable puppets\u2019\u2014but, Jarrell\u2019s soldiers are of course not his friends because they are his babies, his lambs to the slaughter\u2014he broods over them.\u201d Scannell concluded that \u201cthere are moments in [Jarrell\u2019s] war poetry when the force of his passion results in confusion and overstatement but far more frequently it is directed and controlled through a technical assurance that has produced some of the most relentless indictments of the evil of war since [Siegfried] Sassoon and [Wilfred] Owen.\u201d\n\r\nEven when he was not writing on war themes, Jarrell often viewed his characters with pity. Jerome Mazzaro noted the insecurity of his characters, writing in Salmagundi that \u201cJarrell\u2019s personae are always involved with efforts to escape engulfment, implosion, and petrification, by demanding that they somehow be miraculously changed by life and art into people whose ontologies are psychically secure.\u201d The passivity Mazzaro alludes to was frequently cited by other critics, often in reference to Jarrell\u2019s portrayals of women. Some critics felt that Jarrell held a particular compassion for women because he viewed them as being trapped by society; the poem \u201cThe Woman at the Washington Zoo\u201d represents one often-cited example of this view. Jonathan Galassi wrote in Poetry Nation that \u201cJarrell\u2019s women, though conscious there is something wrong in their lives, are unable to define precisely or to respond creatively to their predicaments; they are merely witnesses to their victimization.\u201d Some critics objected to Jarrell\u2019s tone when he wrote about women. Rosenthal asserted that \u201cthere is at times a false current of sentimental condescension toward his subjects, especially when they are female.\u201d But more often than not, critics valued Jarrell\u2019s perspective, appreciating it for its uncommon compassion.\nJarrell\u2019s acute sense of involvement with other people permeated both his poetry and his criticism, according to Levenson. \u201cThough his heart might go out to people as they are and things as they are, he had an ingrained drive to make them better. He could not help telling them to change a word, change a line, change their lives, but the demand he made came out of concern and not out of overbearing authority. No one doubted that. \u2018To Randall\u2019s friends,\u2019 writes Peter Taylor, \u2018there was always the feeling that he was their teacher. To Randall\u2019s students, there was always the feeling that he was their friend.\u2019\u201d\n\r\nJarrell died in a traffic collision in 1965. He was 51.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"], "School/Period:": ["Fugitive"]}}
