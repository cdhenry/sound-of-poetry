Katrovas was adopted by relatives as a teenager and lived in Japan for three years before moving to California. He earned a BA from San Diego State University and an MFA from the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. As he stated in a 2007 interview, \u201cMy response to the chaos of my childhood has been to embrace formalism as an adult artist.\u201d\n\r\nInfluenced by John Keats, Gerald Stern, and Philip Levine, Katrovas is the author of numerous collections of formal poetry, including Green Dragons (1983), Dithyrambs: Choral Lyrics (1998), and Prague Winter (2004). Reviewing Snug Harbor (1987), New York Times critic Sherrod Santos praised Katrovas\u2019s work as \u201ctough, direct, gritty and full of wonder,\u201d observing that his \u201cgreat strength is his ability to touch on other lives without seeming to appropriate them.\u201d\n\r\nAs a 1989 Fulbright Fellow in Prague, Katrovas witnessed the Velvet Revolution firsthand. He is the founding academic director of the Prague Summer Program. He also edited and helped translate a double issue of the New Orleans Review focused on contemporary Czech-Slovak poetry, Ten Years after the Velvet Revolution (2000).\n\r\nKatrovas has published short stories, novels, and memoirs, including The Years of Smashing Bricks (2007). His poetry has been anthologized in Strong Measures: Contemporary American Poetry in Traditional Forms (1997), New American Poets of the \u201990s (1999), Poets of the New Century (2001), and elsewhere.\n\r\nIn addition to his work with the Prague Summer Program, he has taught at the University of New Orleans and Western Michigan University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Eastern Europe"]}}
