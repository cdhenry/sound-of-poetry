His father died when Pessoa was five years old, and the family moved with his mother\u2019s new husband, a consul, to Durban, South Africa, where Pessoa attended an English school. At thirteen Pessoa returned to Portugal for a year-long visit, and returned there permanently in 1905. He studied briefly at the University of Lisbon, and began to publish criticism, prose, and poetry soon thereafter while working as a commercial translator.\n\r\nDuring his life, most of Pessoa\u2019s considerable creative output appeared only in journals, and he published just three collections of poetry in English\u2014Antinous (1918), Sonnets (1918), and English Poems (1921)\u2014and one collection in Portuguese, Mensagem (1933).\n\r\nIn 1914, the year his first poem was published, Pessoa found the three main literary personas, or heteronyms, as he called them, which he would return to throughout his career: Alberto Caeiro, a rural, uneducated poet of great ideas who wrote in free verse; Ricardo Reis, a physician who composed formal odes influenced by Horace; and \u00c1lvaro de Campos, an adventurous London-based naval engineer influenced by poet Walt Whitman and the Italian Futurists. Pessoa published under his own name as well, but considered that work the product of an \u201corthonym,\u201d another literary persona. While other notable writers of his generation used literary personas, such as Pound\u2019s Mauberley and Rilke\u2019s Malte Laurids Brigge, Pessoa alone gave his heteronyms a full life separate from his own, assigning and adopting in turn each persona\u2019s psychology, aesthetics, and politics. Pessoa\u2019s insistence on identity as a flexible, dynamic construction, and his consequent rejection of traditional notions of authorship and individuality, anticipated the concerns of the post-Modernist movement.\n\r\nLater in life, Pessoa created the \u201csemi-heteronym\u201d Bernardo Soares, whose expansive, unbound fictional journal written over a period of 20 years (and assembled with little guidance after Pessoa\u2019s death) became The Book of Disquietude, as well as philosopher and sociologist Ant\u00f3nio Mora, essayist Baron of Teive, critic and Caeiro scholar Thomas Crosse and his brother/collaborator I.I. Crosse, poet Coelho Pacheco, astrologer Raphael Baldaya, and many others, for a total of at least 72 heteronyms.\n\r\nPessoa died in Lisbon in 1935 of cirrhosis of the liver, and only after his death did his work gain widespread publication and acclaim. In The Western Canon, critic Harold Bloom included Pessoa as one of just 26 writers responsible for establishing the parameters of western literature.\n", "attrs": {}}
