In this way, odd little things start to filter through and, eventually, accrete. \u2026 The effect of all of this is a fascinating enactment of the tensions between rationality and fervor.\u201d\nHamilton\u2019s writing has appeared in Bomb,\u00a0Frieze, Art in America, The Brooklyn Rail,\u00a0Two Serious Ladies, and elsewhere. She is\u00a0director of the writing center at Baruch College, CUNY.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
