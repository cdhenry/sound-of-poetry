Nephew and successor to Trajan, he executed his senatorial opponents, abandoned Trajan\u2019s conquests in Armenia and Mesopotamia, and coped with unrest in Mauretania and Parthia. He traveled widely, and many of his accomplishments were related to his visits abroad. He began construction of Hadrian\u2019s Wall (England), completed the temple of Zeus in Athens, created a federation of Greek cities, launched a building program at Delphi, and was initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries. He named Antoninus Pius his successor, to be followed by Marcus Aurelius.\nHadrian is well-known for his dedication to his lover Antino\u00fcs, who drowned in the Nile in 130 CE. Hadrian grieved openly, erecting statues of the young man throughout the empire. These renderings of Antino\u00fcs set a new standard of youthful beauty in sculpture; the low brow, full lips, and brooding look are still recognizable today. Cults to Antino\u00fcs were popular across the empire, and the city of Antino\u00f6polis, Egypt, commemorated his death. \nFour complete poems of Hardrian\u2019s survive, including \u201cLittle Soul,\u201d which was purportedly composed as he lay dying. \n", "attrs": {}}
