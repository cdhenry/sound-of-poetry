A major force in contemporary Arab writing, he published numerous collections of poetry, travel writing, and a novel. His collections of poetry in Arabic include\u00a0Whenever He Saw a Sign (2005), Life Like a Broken Narrative (2004), Arrival of Strangers (1990), and Praise for Another Caf\u00e9 (1979). A selection of his poetry, Shepherd of Solitude: Selected Poems (2009), was translated into English by the poet Khaled Mattawa. Nasser\u2019s novel, first published in Arabic in 2011, appeared in English as Land of No Rain (2013), translated by Jonathan Wright. In the Guardian, a reviewer noted that the novel \u201cparts company with the western forms that\u00a0have dominated the Arab literary landscape. The acclaimed poet \u2026 is a clear descendant of Arab polymaths.\u201d\nIn 2014, Nasser was invited to inaugurate New York University\u2019s Gallatin Global Writers series; the Department of Homeland Security denied him entry into the United States, a ruling that prompted outcries from the PEN American Center, Split This Rock, and numerous other individuals and organizations. In London, Nasser served as managing editor and cultural editor of Al-Quds Al-Arabi, a daily newspaper. He died on October 31, 2019.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Middle East"]}}
