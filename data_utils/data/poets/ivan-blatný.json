An important figure in the country\u2019s interwar avant-garde, Blatn\u00fd was associated with the Skupina 42 (Group 42) circle of artists that included Ji\u0159\u00ed Kol\u00e1r and Kamil Lhot\u00e1k. He published four books in Czechoslovakia in the 1940s, including a work indebted to Proust, Hled\u00e1n\u00ed p\u0159\u00edtomn\u00e9ho \u010dasu (In Search of Present Time, 1947). After the Communist coup in 1948, Blatn\u00fd left Czechoslovakia for England. He spent the next years in and out of mental institutions, becoming permanently institutionalized in 1954. He died in a nursing home in Essex. \u00a0 Blatn\u00fd began writing poetry again in England in 1969; at first, his work was ignored or thrown away by hospital staff. In 1977, his work was recognized by an English nurse with connections to Czechoslovakia and began to be preserved. Some poetry from this time was published in Prague in samizdat, including Bixley Remedial School (1982; later published in Toronto in 1987). According to Anna Moschovakis, \u201cthere is a stark difference between the poems Blatn\u00fd became known for early on and the ones he would write after spending several years in England. The early poems are lyrical, often elegiac, and filled with details about the poet\u2019s life. \u2026 The city, and the poet\u2019s material surroundings, are still present in Blatn\u00fd\u2019s later work, but the lyric mode becomes less prominent, giving way to a more opaque poetics of collage that engages the reader in a playful hunt, refusing to make meaning clear, never telling the whole story. English (along with French and German) becomes integral to Blatn\u00fd's writing practice, and many of his poems of this period are thoroughly multilingual: Not only is the code-switching often seamless but the fact of multilinguality itself figures in the poems, becomes part of their subject.\u201d  \u00a0 Veronika Tuckerov\u00e1 edited a selection of Blatn\u00fd\u2019s work to appear in English as The Drug of Art: Selected Poems (2006, translated by Matthew Sweney, Justin Quinn, and Alex Zucker).\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Eastern Europe"]}}
