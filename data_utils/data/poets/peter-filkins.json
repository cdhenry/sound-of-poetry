Adler: A Life in Many Worlds (2019).\nWriting in the New York Times Book Review, William Ferguson praised Filkins\u2019 use of form \u201cas a finely constructed strategy against chaos, a kind of cage for undomesticated thoughts, while poet Nate Leslie wrote in the Chariton Review, \u201cThe place where observation and idea, where the image and the real intersect, even imperfectly, is where art occurs for Filkins.\u201d Reviewing After Homer for Booklist, Rau Olson observed how Filkins\u2019 poems \u201cregard humanity with Homer\u2019s tragic vision, and \u2026 rouse the same emotions: wonder and pity.\u201d Writing about The View We\u2019re Granted, poet Grace Cavalieri noted, \u201cThis graceful, skilled poet writes especially moving poems,\u201d while critic Michael Dennis remarks, \u201cFilkins\u2019 poems read like they are eternal common knowledge, the stuff we all need to know.\u201d\nFilkins has been awarded the Stover Prize in Poetry from Southwest Review and the New American Press Chapbook Award, as well as fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Massachusetts Cultural Council, Yaddo, MacDowell, the Millay Colony for the Arts, the James Merrill House, and the American Academy in Berlin.
