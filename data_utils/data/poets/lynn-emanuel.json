She earned a BA from Bennington College; an MA from City College of New York, where she studied with\u00a0Adrienne Rich; and an MFA from the University of Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. Emanuel retired from the University of Pittsburgh in 2018, where she founded and directed the Pittsburgh Contemporary Writers\u2019 Series. She taught at the Bread Loaf Writers\u2019 Conference, the Bennington Writers\u2019 Conference, The Warren Wilson Program in Creative Writing, and served as the Elliston Distinguished Poet-in-Residence in the PhD program at the University of Cincinnati. Emanuel is the author of several volumes of poetry, including The Nerve of It: Poems New and Selected (2015) and Noose and Hook (2010). She describes her collections Then, Suddenly\u2014\u00a0(1999), The Dig\u00a0(1992), and Hotel Fiesta\u00a0(1984) as a triptych exploring the convention and flexibility of the book and the agency of readers and writers.\nHer poetry has appeared numerous times in the Pushcart Prize Anthology and Best American Poetry. She has received the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize, the National Poetry Series award for The Dig, two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Eric Matthieu King Award from the Academy of American Poets, and fellowships from the Ranieri Foundation and the National Poetry Series.\nAs poet\u00a0Eavan Boland\u00a0noted, \u201cLynn Emanuel\u2019s poems have a rare power: they connect to the world through estrangement.\u201d Influenced by\u00a0Gertrude Stein\u00a0and Italo\u00a0Calvino\u2019s If on a winter\u2019s night a traveler, Emanuel\u2019s poetry frequently engages the conventions of noir: the recycling of iconic images, the stark color palette, and the tension between stillness and movement, light and grime. Describing the evolution of her work in the context of her increasing intimacy with death, beginning with her father\u2019s death during the composition of\u00a0Then, Suddenly\u2014, Emanuel says she has largely abandoned the lyric because \u201cwith so many dead, it feels grotesque to sing.\u201d\nHer most recent poetry is concerned with violence, the self, and perspective.\u00a0Noose and Hook\u00a0includes a long monologue sequence, \u201cThe Mongrelogues,\u201d that is told from a dog\u2019s point of view. In\u00a0Poets\u2019 Quarterly,\u00a0Adam Tavel describes the series as \u201ca bizarre alchemy of\u00a0Pilgrim\u2019s Progress\u00a0and\u00a0[John] Berryman\u2019s\u00a0Dream Songs\u00a0\u2026 in an inimitable dialect that marries the antiquated syntax of\u00a0John Donne\u00a0with the phonetic spelling in George Herriman\u2019s \u2018Krazy Kat\u2019 comics.\u201d Emanuel\u2019s work also explores ideas of movement and identity. \u201cWhat I always look for in my work,\u201d she says, \u201cis tension, the tension between, for instance, a transparent narrative and a number of other possibilities for poems. I\u2019m interested in the slippery text, the multi-vocal text, and the text that can investigate itself and the possibilities of different positions and stances.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
