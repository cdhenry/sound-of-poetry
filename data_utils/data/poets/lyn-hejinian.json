Her poetry is characterized by an unusual lyricism and descriptive engagement with the everyday. She is the author of many poetry collections, including My Life and My Life in the Nineties (Wesleyan University Press, 2013), The Book of a Thousand Eyes (Omnidawn, 2012),\u00a0 The Fatalist (Omnidawn, 2003), and her landmark work My Life (Burning Deck, 1980). A native Californian, she teaches in the English Department at the University of California, Berkeley.\nLike most Language writing, Hejinian\u2019s work enacts a poetics that is theoretically sophisticated. While Language writing is stylistically diverse and, as a movement, difficult to reduce to a particular style, most writers in this group are concerned with writing in non-standardized, often non-narrative forms. Language writing is community-centered and often takes as its subject progressive politics and social theory. Hejinian\u2019s work, for example, is committed to exploring the political ramifications of the ways that language is typically used. Her work differs, however, from the traditional, identity-affirming, political poetry of most left-wing writers as much as it does from main-stream poets. The poet Juliana Spahr has written of Hejinian, \u201cIt is easier to trace the influence of language philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s aphoristic statement that \u2018the limits of my language mean the limits of my world,\u2019 or to apply Viktor Shklovsky\u2019s theory of \u2018making strange\u2019 to Hejinian's poetry than it is to relate her work to the contemporary poetry usually anthologized in the Norton or Heath anthologies of American literature.\u201d\n\r\nAlthough Language writing tends to be anti-confessional and antirealist, Hejinian\u2019s work does not reject these modes. Her long \u201cnovels\u201d My Life (2002) and Oxata (1991) unabashedly draw on her own experiences and are in some ways recognizably autobiographical. Rather, Hejinian\u2019s work insists that alternative means of expression are necessary to truly represent the confessional or the real. Her work, repeatedly concerned with biography or autobiography, explores the relationship between alternative writing practices and the subjectivity that these genres often obscure. The alternative form that Hejinian uses most frequently is what has come to be called the \u201cnew sentence,\u201d a form of prose poem composed mainly of sentences that have no clear transitions. The gap created by a text that moves from subject to subject invites the reader to participate, to bring his or her own reading to the text.\n\r\nCrucial to understanding Hejinian\u2019s work is the realization that it cultivates, even requires, an act of resistant reading. Spahr noted, \u201cHer work is deliberately unsettling in its unpredictability, its diversions from conventions, the way it is out of control.\u201d In her essay \u201cThe Rejection of Closure,\u201d published in The Language of Iniquiry (2002), a selection of her theoretical writings, Hejinian develops a theory of an \u201copen text\u201d that defines both her earlier work and her current work. \u201cAn open text,\u201d she writes, \u201cis open to the world and particularly to the reader\u2026.[It] invites participation, rejects the authority of the writer over the reader and thus, by analogy, the authority implicit in other (social, economic, cultural) hierarchies.\u201d To provoke the reader\u2019s participation, the open text engages in a series of disruptive techniques that expose the reader to the possibilities of meaning that he or she brings to the text.\n\r\nHejinian\u2019s commitment to the Language movement and its techniques is evident throughout her work. Her first book-length collection, Writing Is an Aid to Memory (1978), investigates the confessional systems of memory and the difficulties of portraying these systems without smoothing over the questions they raise. An example of Hejinian\u2019s \u201copen text\u201d is the autobiographical My Life. Spahr regarded My Life as \u201ccurrently the most important of Hejinian's work,\u201d noting that it has attracted much scholarly attention. Poet and critic Lisa Samuels, in a similar vein, has advocated the inclusion of My Life in the academic \u201ccanon.\u201d This work, through its attention to alternative and multiple ways of telling, refuses to invoke the transparent language conventions that typically compose autobiography.\n\r\nOn a trip to Leningrad with her husband, Hejinian met a variety of contemporary poets who would provide the inspiration for Leningrad (1991). It is a typical Language movement text, even written collaboratively, as is common in the movement. The four poets in this collection alternate voices and discuss various ways post-glasnost society forces them to confront their own politics of encounter. Hejinian\u2019s engagement with Russian poets and poetics has profoundly influenced her work. Her years-long collaboration with the Russian poet Arkadii Dragomoschenko has resulted in a theater piece, film script, and translations of each into the other\u2019s language. It also led to Oxata (1991), a work that displays Hejinian\u2019s interest in form, prose and the self-disclosures of language. Based loosely on Aleksandr Pushkin\u2019s long poem, Eugene Onegin, the work shows, in Marjorie Perloff\u2019s estimation, how \u201cthe long poems of our time \u2026 cannot be pigeonholed.\u201d\nA prolific writer, Hejinian\u2019s work since Oxata has been various and wide-ranging. Her long \u201cautobiographical\u201d poem, My Life, has been twice reprinted and updated. Originally 38 stanzas of 38 lines\u2014Hejinian\u2019s age at the time of initial publication\u2014the work is now 45 stanzas of 45 lines. Her long poem Happily (2000) met with great acclaim and was included in a collection of her essays, The Language of Iniquiry (2002). Selecting from over 25 years of work, the book offers an illuminating glimpse of Hejinian\u2019s influences and preoccupations, especially the centrality of Gertrude Stein to her development as a writer and thinker. Reviewing the book for the Boston Review, Brian Kim Stefans alleged that by \u201cextending the frame of the \u2018poet\u2019s essay\u2019 beyond issues of form and tradition and into an open-ended philosophical dialogue that engages with one in the very act of reading a book, alone at home or in a crowded cafe.\u201d Hejinian\u2019s continued interest in notions of the \u201cexperimental\u201d is evident in some of her most recent work, including Saga/Circus (2009). Again in the Boston Review, Joyelle McSweeney noted how the two long poems of the book \u201cmake short work of narrative and dismantle genre with an alert and damaging wit.\u201d McSweeney concluded, \u201cthe possibilities within Hejinian\u2019s ouevre are inexhaustible, [h]er working and reworking of writing\u2019s generic and epistemological potentials and capabilities is unending. In this life\u2019s work, each falling short produces a conceptual distance into which writing can move.\u201d\nSince the 1970s, when Hejinian began writing, many of the techniques and interests of Language writing have moved from the margins to the fore of American poetry; Hejinian and her fellow Language poets such as Ron Silliman, Charles Bernstein, and Rae Armantrout have also found employment in academia as professors and visiting writers, complicating the \u201coppositional\u201d stance of much of their early work. Discussing the newly-anthologized status of language writing with Craig Dworkin in an interview originally published in Idiom #3, Hejinian noted \u201cBoth the big Messerli anthology and the Norton have the overt ambition to define and historicize a lot of activity, and they\u2019re going to do that. They are going to be, for a long time now, the avenue through which people come to understand and be exposed to this work. That may be good for your generation: there it is, that\u2019s history, now we can get on with what we\u2019re doing. But for me, the big challenge is to remember that this story is not adequate, that it\u2019s not the whole story, that these books don\u2019t feel like what it really was\u2014they don\u2019t really show it.\u201d\nIn addition to teaching literature at University of California, Berkeley, Hejinian has also been an editor and publisher. She was editor of Tuumba Press From 1976 to 1984, and she coedited Poetics Journal (with Barrett Watten) from 1981 to 1999. She is a coeditor of Atelos, which publishes cross-genre collaborations between poets and other artists.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"], "School/Period:": ["Language Poetry"]}}
