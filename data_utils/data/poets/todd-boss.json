He grew up on a cattle farm in Wisconsin, and he earned a BA at St. Olaf College and an MFA from the University of Alaska Anchorage. His first poetry collection,\u00a0Yellowrocket\u00a0(W.W. Norton, 2008), was named one of the 10 best poetry books of 2008 by\u00a0Virginia Quarterly Review\u00a0and was a finalist for the Minnesota Book Award.\u00a0He is also the author of\u00a0Pitch\u00a0(W.W. Norton, 2012), which won the Midwest Booksellers\u00a0Choice Award for Poetry, and\u00a0Tough Luck\u00a0(W.W. Norton, 2016). His poetry has been featured in\u00a0the\u00a0New Yorker,\u00a0Poetry\u00a0magazine,\u00a0the\u00a0American Poetry Review,\u00a0The Times\u00a0(London), Ted Kooser\u2019s newspaper column \u201cAmerican Life in Poetry,\u201d and on National Public Radio.\u00a0 It has been anthologized\u00a0in\u00a0Best American Poetry\u00a0and elsewhere.\u00a0\nBoss\u2019s pared-down, idea-driven poems are infused with internal rhyme and propulsive rhythms. They balance clarity with a nuanced attention to sound. The poet Tony Hoagland wrote, \u201cThere is a rich physicality in all of Todd Boss\u2019s poems, a reverent\u00a0gusto for representing\u00a0the tactile aspects of human life. His poems are about matter in motion\u2014apple-slices, Chopin, horses, light, and people. \u2026 The poems are never pretentious but\u00a0always acrobatic, sensuous,\u00a0technically inventive, muscular and fun.\u201d\u00a0Critic Elizabeth Lund observed in a review of Yellowrocket\u00a0for the\u00a0Christian Science Monitor\u00a0that Boss \u201cbalanc[es] raw beauty with traditionally poetic topics: growing up on a farm, marriage, and fatherhood. \u2026 Boss\u2019s writing aches with subtle music, insight, and clearsighted compassion.\u201d\nHis honors include the Emily Clark Balch Prize for Poetry from\u00a0Virginia Quarterly Review\u00a0and the Glenna Luschei\u00a0Prairie Schooner\u00a0Award. He has also received several Pushcart Prize nominations, grants from the Minnesota State Arts Board and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, and a residency with the Ragdale Foundation.\n\r\nSince 2008, Boss\u00a0has served as the founding executive and artistic director of Motionpoems, a leading producer of poetry films. The organization\u00a0received an honorable mention for the\u00a0Innovations in Reading Prize from the National Book Foundation, and has\u00a0adapted a series of films for children in association with the Poetry Foundation.\nBoss\u2019s choral texts, written primarily for composer Jake Runestad, have been performed at the Kennedy Center and throughout the world. As a public artist, Boss creates large-scale multimedia installations in public spaces, which often include poetry. He holds several patents for consumer electronics accessories. He has also worked as a public relations executive, nonprofit arts administrator, journalist, teacher, and business consultant. In 2018, he began house sitting his way around the world.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
