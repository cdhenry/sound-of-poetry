His father, a well-known physician, was a friend and confidant of Samuel Coleridge Taylor, and his aunt was the novelist Maria Edgework. Beddoes was still an undergraduate at Oxford when he published his first book,\u00a0The Improvisatore\u00a0(1821), as well as his first play,\u00a0The Bride\u2019s Tragedy\u00a0(1822). During this time, he met and began a lifelong friendship with Thomas Forbes Kelsall, who appreciated and preserved many of Beddoes\u2019s original works. Beddoes also befriend Mary Shelley, whose writing shared with Beddoes many themes and preoccupations. Although his play was critically praised, Beddoes left England in 1825 to study medicine in Germany and enrolled at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBeddoes, according to I. Bamforth in Medical Humanties, \u201cdistinguished himself there for his academic brilliance as well as his unruliness.\u201d Bamforth says that is was during this time Beddoes was \u201cstudying in G\u00f6ttingen with the famous comparative anatomist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752\u20131840), who has also gone down in history as one of the first ethnographers, that he started work on his masterpiece Death\u2019s Jest-Book, a surreal mortality play. Masterpiece, that is, in the sense that any monster made of spare parts is all of a piece.\"\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe unstageable Death\u2019s Jest-Book is a \u201cnightmarish drama of murder, disguise, revenge, and ghosts,\u201d according to the W.W. Norton website. Writing on Beddoes for the Carcanet Press website, John Ashbery calls the work \u201ca kind of\u00a0bottomless pit that absorbed most of his creative energies during his final years. As in all his plays, the plot is murky to the point of incomprehensibility, and the characters exist mainly to\r\nmouth Beddoes' extraordinary lines, though they do collide messily with one another.\u201d Ashbery continues, \u201cDeath was Beddoes' main subject, both as a poet and as a medical man; he seems relaxed and happy only when writing about it.\"\n\r\nObsessed with death, Beddoes struggled with manic depression and alcoholism. During the course of his life, Beddoes would be expelled from one university, deported from Bavaria, forced to leave Z\u00fcrich, and arrested numerous times.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHe committed suicide in 1849.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Romantic"]}}
