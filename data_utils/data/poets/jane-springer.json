Her debut poetry collection, Dear Blackbird (2007), won the Agha Shahid Ali Prize from the University of Utah Press. Her second collection, Murder Ballad (2012), received the Beatrice Hawley Award from Alice James Books. Influenced by Flannery O\u2019Connor and Larry Levis, Springer writes narrative, often long-form poems that portray rural Southern life as at once mythic and passionate. Poet Lynnell Edwards, reviewing Murder Ballad, noted, \"Springer's long line is fearless in its music, indulging luscious sounds and pounding measures. Traversing the despair of the rural south, [she] exploits the urgency and dread of every keening murder ballad, showing how that cleaving is both our undoing and our salvation.\"  \u00a0 In an author\u2019s statement for the National Endowment for the Arts, Springer described her work as \u201clove letters to the South,\u201d adding, \u201cThe landscapes and stories of folks in and around the towns I come from seem too small and fleeting for notation in conventional history books; when viewed as integral to a long tradition of pastorals that Theocritus began, they seem more lyrically epic, somehow: more as I see them.\u201d \u00a0 Her honors include a Whiting Writers\u2019 Award, a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Associated Writing Programs\u2019 AWP Intro Award, and the Robert Penn Warren Prize for Poetry. Springer lives in upstate New York and teaches at Hamilton College.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"]}}
