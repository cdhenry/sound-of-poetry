Harper was born in 1938, in Brooklyn, New York. He earned his BA and MA from California State University and his MFA from the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. Known for his innovative use of jazz rhythms, cultural allusion, historical referent, and personal narrative, Harper was \u201ca deeply complex poet whose mission is to unite the fractured, inhumane technologies of our time with the abiding deep well of Negro folk traditions,\u201d wrote John Callahan in the New Republic. Poetry\u00a0reviewer Paul Breslin\u00a0noted that\u00a0Harper did this\u00a0by drawing \u201cupon black history, literature, and myth.\u201d However, Harper was distinctive in that he often sought to bridge the traditional separation between black\u00a0America and white\u00a0America, writing poems that speak across the divide and draw upon elements of the racial, historical, and personal past of all Americans.\n\r\nHarper\u2019s vision\u00a0came through a sustained engagement with other cultures. In an interview with Contemporary Authors, Harper noted that his voice evolved from travels made in the late 1960s \u201cto Mexico and Europe where those landscapes broadened my scope and interest in poetry and culture of other countries while I searched my own family and racial history for folklore, history, and myth for themes that would give my writing the tradition and context where I could find my own voice. My travels made me look closely at the wealth of human materials in my own life, its ethnic richness, complexity of language and stylization, the tension between stated moral idealism and brutal historical realities, and I investigated the inner reality of those struggles to find the lyrical expression of their secrets in my own voice.\u201d\n\r\nHarper\u2019s interest in history pervaded\u00a0his poetry. David Lehman, in Poetry, noted that Harper\u2019s efforts are \u201cattempts of a more historical nature to illuminate the black experience in America.\u201d Using stories from both his family's past and from events in black history in general, he builds a sophisticated vision of racial encounter and experience. Harper\u2019s use of jazz and blues in his poems is also remarkable. Through syncopation, rhyme, and rhythm, Harper alluded\u00a0to musical forms that were born out of the African-American experience. In doing so, he often managed\u00a0to destabilize or blur time and historical awareness. In his first volume, the National Book Award-nominated Dear John, Dear Coltrane (1970), Harper\u00a0used the legendary jazz pioneer John Coltrane as a character and cribs his style. Coltrane became\u00a0a link for Harper to connect the historical with his own personal family history.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn his next books, Harper continued to explore his own family ancestry and the trauma of history. History is Your Own Heartbeat (1971) won the Poetry Award of the Black Academy of Letters. The success of Harper\u2019s early work may have been due in part to his sense of \u201chistory automatically yielding up its metaphor, as the facts are salvaged by the careful eye and ear informed by a remarkable imagination which balances the American present and past,\u201d according to Laurence Lieberman in the Yale Review. Although Harper\u2019s early work included many poems about his wife\u2019s family, his wife, and their children, it was not until the publication of Nightmare Begins Responsibility (1974) that he began to write about his own past, including the lives of his grandfathers and his mother\u2019s mother. But in addition to personal family figures, Harper frequently used key historical figures. In collections such as Dear John, Dear Coltrane (1970), Debridement (1973), and Images of Kin (1977), also nominated for a National Book Award, figures such as baseball player Jackie Robinson, novelist Richard Wright, poet Sterling Brown, and jazz musician John Coltrane are treated as \u201ckin.\u201d Scholar Michael G. Cooke elaborated on Harper\u2019s use of \u201ckinship\u201d: \u201ckinship means social bonding, a recognition of likeness in context, concern, need, liability, value. It is humanistic, a cross between consanguinity and technical organization.\u201d Cooke commented that while Harper \u201cinvokes blood relations\u201d in several inspired cases, \u201chis approach to kinship is a radiant one, reaching out across time, across space, even across race\u201d to include white men such as the Puritan dissident and founder of Rhode Island, Roger Williams, and the farmer-turned-abolitionist, John Brown. Harper\u2019s acceptance of both black and white historical figures as \u201ckin\u201d is unique. Both accepting and utilizing black and white literary forms and techniques in his work, Harper acknowledges a dual tradition of American letters.\n\r\nHarper\u2019s later collections of poetry included Honorable Amendments (1995), Songlines in Michaeltree: New and Collected Poems (2000), which brings together work from Harper's past, as well as previously unpublished verse, Debridement/Song (2002), and Use Trouble (2009). As a professor at Brown University from 1970 to\u00a02016, Harper helped shape generations of poets, writers, and scholars. The first poet laureate of Rhode Island (1988-1993), he received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation, among others. In 2008 he won the prestigious Frost Medal for Lifetime Achievement from the Poetry Society of America.\n\r\nIn the African-American Review, Keith Leonard wrote that in Harper\u2019s \u201cbest poems about personal pain, about historical figures like Frederick Douglass, or about musicians and writers and, therefore, about artistry, his chiseled, forbidding poetics effectively suggest the harrowing unity between vision and memory, Western and non-Western, pain and beauty, by which Harper defines black identity and resists literary convention.\u201d Michael S. Harper died in 2016.\n", "attrs": {}}
