In poems, novels, short stories, plays and over two dozen books for young people, Soto recreates the world of the barrio, the urban, Spanish-speaking neighborhood where he was raised, bringing the sights, sounds and smells vividly to life within the pages of his books. Soto\u2019s poetry and prose focus on everyday experiences while evoking the harsh forces that often shape life for Chicanos, including racism, poverty, and crime. In his writing, as Raymund Paredes noted in the\u00a0Rocky Mountain Review, \u201cSoto establishes his acute sense of ethnicity and, simultaneously, his belief that certain emotions, values, and experiences transcend ethnic boundaries and allegiances.\u201d Soto himself has said that \u201cas a writer, my duty is not to make people perfect, particularly Mexican Americans. I\u2019m not a cheerleader. I\u2019m one who provides portraits of people in the rush of life.\u201d Soto has received high praise for his poetry\u2014his collections have been finalists for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, and he has received a\u00a0Nation/Discovery Award and the Levinson Award from\u00a0Poetry.\u00a0However, Soto is perhaps best known and most beloved as a writer for children and young adults. Exploring universal themes like alienation, family life, and choices, Soto\u2019s work for young and adolescent readers has been praised for its honest portrayal of communities too often relegated to the margins of American life. He has received many awards for his work as a children\u2019s author, including awards from the National Education Association and the PEN Center, and the Tom\u00e1s Rivera Book Award.\n\r\nGary Soto was born in Fresno, California in 1952 to working-class parents who often struggled to find work. Soto worked in the fields of San Joaquin and the factories of Fresno as a young man. Though he did not excel in school, by the time he was an adolescent Soto had discovered the work of Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, Jules Verne, and Robert Frost. \u201cIn short,\u201d he has said, \u201cI was already thinking like a poet, already filling myself with literature.\u201d Soto went to college at Fresno City College and California State University-Fresno, where he earned a BA in English in 1974. While at Fresno, Soto studied with the poet Philip Levine, whose sharp portrayals of working-class subject matter influenced Soto\u2019s own poetry. Other influences from this period include Edward Field, James Wright, Pablo Neruda, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Soto earned an MFA from the University of California-Irvine in 1974. His first book,\u00a0The Elements of San Joaquin\u00a0(1977),\u00a0offers a grim portrait of Mexican American life. His poems depict the violence of urban life, the exhausting labor of rural life, and the futility of trying to recapture the innocence of childhood. The book was awarded the United States Award from the International Poetry Forum and published in the Pitt Poetry Series.\n\r\nSoto's skill with the figurative language of poetry has been noted by reviewers throughout his career. In\u00a0Western American Literature\u00a0Jerry Bradley praised the metaphors in\u00a0The Elements of San Joaquin\u00a0as \u201cevocative, enlightening, and haunting.\u201d Soto\u2019s second volume,\u00a0The Tale of Sunlight\u00a0(1978), was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Soto\u2019s work often springs from observation of daily life, portrayals of working-class characters, and memory. In the poems in\u00a0Black Hair\u00a0(1985) Soto focuses on his friends and family, conjuring the times he shared with his friends as an adolescent and more recent moments spent with his young daughter. Ellen Lesser, writing in\u00a0Voice Literary Supplement,\u00a0was charmed by Soto's poetic tone, \u201cthe quality of the voice, the immediate, human presence that breathes through the lines.\u201d The critic claimed that Soto's celebration of innocence and sentiment is shaded with knowledge of \u201cthe larger, often threatening world.\u201d Soto\u2019s poetry often deals with childhood reminiscences, and his later collections sometimes blur the line between \u201cadult\u201d and \u201cjuvenile\u201d poetry. Collections like\u00a0Neighborhood Odes\u00a0(1992) and\u00a0Canto Familiar/Familiar Song\u00a0(1996)\u00a0take on themes familiar to both: family, community, and place.\u00a0A Fire in my Hands\u00a0(2006) includes one of Soto\u2019s most popular poems, \u201cOranges,\u201d as well as a Q&A in which Soto discusses writing and the life of a poet.\n\r\nSoto\u2019s prose works\u2014including memoirs, short stories and novels\u2014also engage themes that are central to his poetry. In collections like\u00a0Living up the Street: Narrative Recollections\u00a0(1985),\u00a0Small Faces\u00a0(1986),\u00a0and\u00a0Lesser Evils: Ten Quartets\u00a0(1988) he uses vignettes drawn from his own childhood. In these deliberately small-scale recollections, as Paredes noted, \u201cit is a measure of Soto's skill that he so effectively invigorates and sharpens our understanding of the commonplace.\u201d With these volumes Soto acquired a solid reputation as a prose writer as well as a poet;\u00a0Living up the Street\u00a0earned him an American Book award. Soto\u2019s autobiography,\u00a0A Summer Life\u00a0(1990), extended his interest in memoir and vignette. Consisting of 39 short essays, the pieces form a mosaic of Soto\u2019s youth. During the early 1990s Soto turned his attentions towards writing for children and young adults. A first volume of short stories for young readers,\u00a0Baseball in April, and Other Stories,\u00a0was published in 1990. Like much of the work that followed, the 11 tales depict Mexican American boys and girls as they enter adolescence in Hispanic California neighborhoods. In the\u00a0New York Times Book Review,\u00a0Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria called the stories \u201csensitive and economical,\u201d then praised Soto: \u201cBecause he stays within the teenagers\u2019 universe \u2026 he manages to convey all the social change and stress without bathos or didacticism. In fact, his stories are moving, yet humorous and entertaining.\u201d Soto\u2019s work for younger readers, including his poetry, has continued to be highly praised for its sensitivity and scope. Soto\u2019s other works of fiction for young adults include the popular novel\u00a0Buried Onions\u00a0(1997) and its sequel\u00a0The Afterlife\u00a0(2003); among his many picture books for children are\u00a0Chato\u2019s Kitchen\u00a0(1995) and\u00a0My Little Car/Mi Carrito\u00a0(2006). Soto\u2019s work for children is also noted for its seamless integration of Spanish words into English text, making it useful in mixed-language classrooms.\n\r\nSoto's ability to tell a story, to recreate moments of his own past, and to transport his reader to the world of his childhood is felt within each of his written works. \u201cSoto's remembrances are as sharply defined and appealing as bright new coins,\u201d wrote Alicia Fields in the\u00a0Bloomsbury Review. \u201cHis language is spare and simple yet vivid.\u201d But it is his joyful outlook, strong enough to transcend the poverty of the barrio, that makes his work so popular. As he told Hector Avalos Torres in the\u00a0Dictionary of Literary Biography,\u00a0writing \u201cis my one talent. There are a lot of people who never discover what their talent is \u2026 I am very lucky to have found mine.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
