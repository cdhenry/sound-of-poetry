He has served as a Fulbright scholar in Madrid and as a Guggenheim fellow.\u00a0In 2015 he was awarded a prestigious MacArthur fellowship.\nLerner is the author of several full-length poetry collections, including No Art (2016);\u00a0Mean Free Path (2010);\u00a0Angle of Yaw (2006), which was a finalist for the National Book Award and the Northern California Book Award; and the\u00a0sonnet sequence\u00a0The Lichtenberg Figures (2004), which won the Hayden Carruth Award, was chosen by Library Journal as one of the year\u2019s 12 best poetry books, and was a Lannan Literary Selection. His poetry has also been included in the anthologies 12x12: Conversations in Poetry and Poetics (2009),\u00a0New Voices (2008), and Best American Poetry. His novels include The Topeka School (2019),\u00a010:04 (2014), and\u00a0Leaving the Atocha Station (2011). The Hatred of Poetry, his monograph, was published in 2016 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux.\nRanging from sonnets to extended, collage-based prose poems, Lerner\u2019s work often uses scientific structures to explore the relationship between language, form, and movement. Noting his use of \u201carresting lines that are comical, anxious and hauntingly true,\u201d Boston Review critic Craig Morgan Teicher described Lerner\u2019s aim in Angle of Yaw to \u201cjuxtapose discordant elements of noise such that their collective racket cancels each component out, leaving behind a language purged by negation\u2014refreshed, defiant, and wholly self-aware.\u201d In a 2004 interview with Kent Johnson for Jacket magazine, Lerner described that collection as focused on \u201cthe commercialization of public space and speech. I\u2019m also interested in the ways that technologies of viewing\u2014aerial photography in particular\u2014replace the God-term with a camera that feeds our spectacular culture an image of itself.\u201d\nIn 2002, Lerner cofounded, with Deb Klowden, No: a journal of the arts, and he has also served as the poetry editor for Critical Quarterly. He has taught at the University of Pittsburgh and California College of the Arts, and he is a distinguished professor in the English department at Brooklyn College.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
