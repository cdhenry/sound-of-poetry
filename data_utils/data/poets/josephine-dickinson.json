She studied classics at Oxford University and went on to establish a career as a musician, composer, and poet. In her late 30s she relocated to Alston, a remote English Cumbrian town, where she met and married an elderly sheep farmer, Douglas Dickinson, who died in 2004.\u00a0Her collections of poetry include Night Journey (2008),\u00a0The Voice (2004), and\u00a0Scarberry Hill (2001). Silence Fell (2007) contains a selection of poems from her first two books and is Dickinson\u2019s first American publication, with an introduction by poet Galway Kinnell.\nHer poems, rich in natural imagery, are sometimes metered or rhymed, but always attentive to sound in their tender evocations of rural life. As New York Times Book Review critic James Longenbach noted in a review of Silence Fell, \u201cHer acute relationship to the physical sensation of language distinguishes these humble, deftly made poems.\u201d In a 2007 interview with the Times (London), Dickinson stated, \u201cI do know that I found speech more difficult than music to cope with after the deafness. I came to see the written word as a liberation, which was wonderful. Very exotic and exciting.\u201d\nDickinson continues to tend her late husband\u2019s sheep farm.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
