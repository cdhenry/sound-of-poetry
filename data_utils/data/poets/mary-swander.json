Her verses speak of natural wonders, of learning from the land, and of the people who live and work on the land. Her work has been greatly influenced by a serious medical condition, one that led her to take up a simple life among the Amish. She chronicled her integration into their culture in her book Out of This World: A Woman\u2019s Life among the Amish (1995).\nSince childhood, Swander had suffered with many allergies and food sensitivities. In 1983, an allergist\u2019s treatment, far from improving her situation, drove her into an autoimmune disorder called \u201cenvironmental illness,\u201d a condition that causes the body to reject most foods, pollutants, and odors. A whiff of perfume or any common cleaning agent, or even a bite of non-organically-farmed food would send her into a severe reaction that might require a trip to the hospital. Just finding foods to eat in order to survive was a tremendous challenge, and it led the author to try such unusual meals as road-killed squirrel, yucca plant, and bear meat. Eventually, her quest for health led her to buy an old schoolhouse in an area of Iowa settled by the Amish, a religious group that practices a lifestyle free of modern chemicals and conveniences. Here she became dedicated to feeding herself by careful, organic gardening and raising her own goats and poultry.\nThe Amish are known for being a closed society, in fact referring to all who are not Amish by the term \u201cEnglish.\u201d Despite her \u201cEnglish\u201d status, Swander found that she was warmly welcomed by her new neighbors. \u201cWhere she expected a dour, humorless people, she found mischievous, often sparkling wit. Where she thought to find the inferior effects of an eighth-grade education, she saw a resourceful culture equipped to adapt to any natural condition,\u201d reported Rebecca Freligh in the Cleveland Plain Dealer. \u201cSwander had also believed that the Amish culture was oppressive to women. Instead, she writes, her neighbors had a thing or two to teach her about feminism.\u201d Eventually, Swander was able to adjust her body chemistry so that she could accept about 200 different foods and tolerate some of the common pollutants of everyday life. Elizabeth Cameron, a contributor to Natural Health, felt that Out of This World \u201cis an inspiring, carefully and beautifully written memoir that nudges readers to make the same kind of discoveries in dealing with a difficult illness or other challenge as Swander made in learning to cope with hers.\u201d\nThe author\u2019s concern with health, healing, and natural food production has colored much of her work. For example, she has coedited The Healing Circle: Authors Writing of Recovery (1998), a collection of essays by writers who have struggled with chronic or long-term illness. A reviewer for the Los Angeles Times called this a book that \u201cdeserves a very wide audience,\u201d including health-care workers, patients, and \u201cany lover of good writing.\u201d Swander also edited Bloom and Blossom: The Reader\u2019s Guide to Gardening, which features a collection of works about gardening. \u201cReaders won\u2019t learn any techniques in this volume but will find an affirmation of the emotional benefits of working the soil,\u201d reported Molly Newling in Library Journal.\nSwander\u2019s poetry collection Succession (1980) has earned praise and sparked comparisons with the work of Southern author Flannery O\u2019Connor. Like O\u2019Connor, Swander uses country scenes and details to \u201cdeal with the interiors of characters and with the fact, and mystery, of death,\u201d wrote Joyce Coyne Dyer in Iowa Woman. Swander writes with \u201cprecision and brilliance\u201d about people and places she has known, creating \u201ca poetic genealogy that is invested with emotion.\u201d\nSwander\u2019s Driving the Body Back (1986) shows her skill in creating a narrative stitched together with authentic characters and idioms. Like a Midwest version of Faulkner\u2019s As I Lay Dying or Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, Swander tells stories which Dyer, in Poet and Critic, called \u201csometimes outrageous, often entertaining, and always emotional.\u201d Louise Erdrich, in the New York Times Book Review, noted how Swander\u2019s \u201cnovelistic form is direct and interesting\u201d as she details, through the voices of nine eccentric and vivid family members, the driving of the poet\u2019s mother across Iowa to be buried in the town in which she was born, giving the reader \u201ca unique perspective on the minutiae of everyday rural and small-town life.\u201d In Heaven-and-Earth House (1994), Swander \u201csteps up into the big leagues of her art,\u201d according to Pat Monaghan in Booklist, as \u201cher poems attend to life\u2019s small joys: a muddy road, calm weather, spicy apples.\u201d The critic for Publishers Weekly found that the poems create a \u201cmusic of Midwest rural encounters\u201d as the reader walks along \u201ca pathway with \u2018common\u2019 language: the rhythms of weather, humor and talk.\u201d In 2009, Swander published the poetry collection The Girls on the Roof. With the Eulenspiegel Puppet Company, she created a performance piece based on this collection.\n", "attrs": {}}
