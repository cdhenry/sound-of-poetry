Gumilev was born in 1886, in Kronstadt. From 1906 to 1908, he lived in Paris, France, where he attended university lectures. He later studied in St. Petersburg, Russia, but did not complete a degree. As a student he met Anna Andreyevna Gorenko, who would become a famous poet under the name of Anna Akhmatova, and who he married in 1910. In 1905, while still in his teens, Gumilev published his first verse collection, Put\u2019 konkvistadorov (\u201cThe Path of the Conquistadors\u201d), which was strongly influenced by French Symbolism. Critics generally regard this volume as insignificant. For example, Earl Sampson, writing in Russian Literature Triquarterly, noted that though Gumilev began writing poetry in his teens, his artistic development was \u201cslow, almost painfully slow.\u201d Sampson described Put konkvistadorov as \u201cdefinitely, irritatingly adolescent\u201d and \u201chighly derivative,\u201d and he added that \u201cGumilev himself later regretted having published it.\u201d\nGumilev followed Put\u2019 konkvistadorov with such poetry collections as Romanticheskie tsvety (\u201cRomantic Flowers,\u201d 1908) and Zhemchuga (\u201cPearls,\u201d 1910), which, although written in the tradition of Symbolism, impressed contemporary critics with its rich, exotic, daring imagery. These works, as Sampson noted in his Russian Literature Triquarterly appraisal, \u201cshow maturation and development.\u201d\nGumilev was an active participant in St. Petersburg\u2019s literary life as a poet and critic. Particularly interested in poetics\u2014the theory of poetry\u2014Gumilev was instrumental in starting Acmeism, a new literary movement. Gumilev founded the \u201cGuild of Poets,\u201d and in 1912, with fellow poet Sergey Gorodetsky, invented the term \u201cacmeism,\u201d based on the Greek word akme, meaning \u201cpinnacle,\u201d to denote a new orientation in poetry.\nA reaction to a mystical approach to poetry\u2014which provided many of Gumilev\u2019s contemporaries an opportunity to address metaphysical and spiritual subjects\u2014acmeism, with its focus on poetic technique, as well on procedures favoring clarity of expression, not only gained wide critical approval, but also exerted a significant influence on Russian poetry. Exemplifying this poetry of clarity and concision is Gumilev\u2019s own Cuzoe nebo (\u201cForeign Sky,\u201d 1912). Here Gumilev completely abandons Symbolism, with its mysticism and musicality, showing his predilection for direct poetic expression. Nevertheless, as critics have written, Gumilev continued to revel in the exoticism characteristic of his early poetry.\nWhen World War I broke out, Gumilev volunteered for service and soon found himself in the cavalry. He ultimately fought in the front lines, where he distinguished himself as a soldier of remarkable courage. For his efforts, he received two medals, including the distinguished Cross of St. George.\nIn ensuing collections\u2014notably Kolchan (\u201cThe Quiver,\u201d 1916)\u2014Gumilev showed his prowess as a writer of war poems. N. Elaine Rusinko wrote in Slavic and East-European Journal, \u201cGumilev\u2019s war poems are usually exalted and rhetorical in tone. He treats the \u2018poetic\u2019 aspects of the situation (honor, courage, sacrifice) with little concern for objective reality.\u201d Thus Gumilev, despite his Acmeist ideas, remained faithful to poetry as an expression of fantasy. Writing about \u201cSolntse dukha\u201d (\u201cThe Sun of the Spirit\u201d), Rusinko noted Gumilev\u2019s \u201crhetorical exuberance\u201d and his \u201cpatriotic fervor.\u201d Marc Slonim described Kolchan in Modern Russian Literature: From Chekhov to the Present as one replete with \u201cfierce combats, savage natives, and East African landscapes.\u201d Slonim added, \u201cIn the forest and deserts of the Dark Continent [Gumilev] found not only proud fighters who die superbly ... but also a violence of colors, a power, and a spontaneous and magnificent outburst of the life instinct.\u201d\nGumilev was eventually transferred from combat duty to administrative posts, but when the 1917 revolution erupted in Russia, he returned home. He found work as a lecturer, but he also continued to produce poetry collections.\u00a0Among Gumilev\u2019s other publications is Kostyor (\u201cThe Bonfire,\u201d 1918), another volume in which he demonstrated his affinity for the exotic. When Kostyor appeared, Gumilev was relatively well established in the Russian literary community. He lectured at various educational institutions and served on the editorial board of Vsemirnaya Literatura, which was prominent in publishing.\nAccording to Dimitry Obolensky, Gumilev\u2019s poetic oeuvre reaches its apex during the period after 1918. Discerning a certain duality in Gumilev\u2019s poetry, a duality which, in his view, characterizes the works of Akhmatova, Obolensky wrote that, in the poems written between 1918 and 1921, Gumilev \u201cachieved remarkable emotional tenseness and visionary power\u2014as in the \u2018The Sixth Sense\u2019 or the hauntingly suggestive \u2018Tram that Lost Its Way.\u2019\u201d\nUnlike many of his colleagues, Gumilev was not a supporter of Bolshevik power in Russia. In fact, he openly proclaimed himself a monarchist. In addition, he expressed his disdain for the revolution by publishing Ognennyi stolp \u00a0(\u201cThe Pillar of Fire,\u201d 1921), a collection of fantastic, even nightmarish, poems rejecting the communist triumph. Here Gumilev profoundly expresses his hate for the revolution and his disdain for communism\u2019s emphasis on the collective over the individual. An ensuing volume, Shatyor (\u201cThe Tent,\u201d 1921), is likewise caustic in its considerations of the revolution.\nIn 1921 Gumilev was arrested, charged as a co-conspirator in the anti-communist conspiracy known as the Tagantsev plot, and executed without trial. For several years, the Soviet establishment regarded him as a non-person.\nNevertheless, the Soviet regime was unable to prevent the posthumous publication of K sinyei Zvezde (\u201cTo a Blue Star,\u201d 1923), the poetry collection that Earl Sampson described in Russian Literature Triquarterly as Gumilev\u2019s \u201cbest and most significant work.\u201d Unlike Ognennyi stolp and Shatyor, K sinyei zvezde harkens back to the more lyrical style of Gumilev\u2019s earlier poems.\nIn the years after Gumilev\u2019s death, his works and reputation fell into obscurity. After the appearance of K sinyei zvezde and the essay collection Pisma o russkoy poezii, no further volumes of his writings appeared in the Soviet Union for more than 60 years, although some of his works were featured in Soviet anthologies. Only in the mid-1980s did Soviet authorities allow the publication of Gumilev\u2019s works. Thus, after a very long hiatus, Russian readers were afforded the opportunity to renew acquaintance with the writer described by Sampson as an extraordinary poet, whose late poetry \u201ctells us that he was in the midst of his creative development, that he still had new creative paths to follow, had fate so decreed.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Russia"]}}
