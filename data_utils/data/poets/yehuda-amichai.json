His poems, written in Hebrew, have been translated into 40 languages, and entire volumes of his work have been published in English, French, German, Swedish, Spanish, and Catalan. \u201cYehuda Amichai, it has been remarked with some justice,\u201d according to translator Robert Alter, \u201cis the most widely translated Hebrew poet since King David.\u201d Amichai\u2019s translations into English have been particularly popular, and his imaginative and accessible style credited with introducing contemporary Hebrew poetry to American and English readers. The poet C.K. Williams described Amichai as \u201cthe shrewdest and most solid of poetic intelligences.\u201d Amichai\u2019s numerous books of poetry include his first in Hebrew, Now and In Other Days (1955), which announced his distinctively colloquial voice, and two breakthrough volumes that introduced him to American readers: Poems (1969) and Selected Poems of Yehuda Amichai (1971), both co-translated by Ted Hughes, who became a good friend and advocate of Amichai\u2019s work. Later works translated into English include Time: Travels of a Latter-Day Benjamin of Tudela (1976), Yehuda Amichai: A Life in Poetry 1948-1994 (1994), The Selected Poetry of Yehuda Amichai (1996), Exile at Home (1998), and Open Closed Open (2000). Amichai also published two novels, including his first work to be translated into English, Not of This Time, Not of This Place (1968), and a book of short stories.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBorn in Germany in 1924, Amichai and his family fled the country during Hitler\u2019s rise to power when Amichai was 12 and settled in Palestine. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war he fought with the Israeli defense forces. The rigors and horrors of his service in this conflict, and in World War II, inform his poetry. In an interview with the Paris Review, Amichai noted that all poetry was political: \u201cThis is because real poems deal with a human response to reality, and politics is part of reality, history in the making,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if a poet writes about sitting in a glass house drinking tea, it reflects politics.\u201d It was during World War II that Amichai began to be interested in poetry, reading modern English and American poetry, by authors such as Dylan Thomas, W.H. Auden, and T.S. Eliot. According to Alter, Amichai\u2019s early work bears a resemblance to the poetry of Thomas and Auden. \u201c[Rainer Maria] Rilke,\u201d wrote Alter, \u201cis another informing presence for him, occasionally in matters of style\u2014he has written vaguely Rilkesque elegies\u2014but perhaps more as a model for using a language of here and now as an instrument to catch the glimmerings of a metaphysical beyond.\u201d Although Amichai\u2019s native language was German, he read Hebrew fluently by the time he immigrated to Palestine.\n\r\nAfter World War II, Amichai attended Hebrew University. He taught in secondary schools, teachers\u2019 seminars, Hebrew University, and later at American institutions such as New York University, the University of California-Berkeley, and Yale University. In a New York Times Magazine profile of Amichai, Alter noted that by the mid-1960s Amichai was \u201calready regarded in many circles in Israel as the country\u2019s leading poet.\u201d Amichai\u2019s reputation outside of Israel soon soared. Amichai, Alter explained, was \u201caccorded international recognition unprecedented for a modern Hebrew poet.\u201d In Israel, his books were frequently bestsellers, and in 1982, Amichai received the prestigious Israel Prize for Poetry for effecting \u201ca revolutionary change in poetry\u2019s language.\u201d Among his many other honors and awards, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhile he became known as an \u201caccessible\u201d poet whose work translated seamlessly into many languages, Alter has taken pains to describe Amichai\u2019s style as something much more complex in its native Hebrew. Amichai frequently exploited Hebrew\u2019s levels of diction, Alter noted in an article for Modern Hebrew Literature, which are generally based on historical usage of words, rather than class. Alter continues: \u201cAmichai\u2019s exploitation of indigenous stylistic resources is often connected with his sensitivity to the expressive sounds of the Hebrew words he uses and with his inventive puns, which are sometimes playful, sometimes dead serious, and often both at once. But what is most untranslatable are the extraordinary allusive twists he gives to densely specific Hebrew terms and texts.\u201d Despite the echoes of other poets and traditions in his work, Alter stressed it was important to remember \u201cthat Amichai is not simply an Auden or a William Carlos Williams writing from right to left, that he uses his own language and literary tradition as a delicately tuned instrument that communicates to Hebrew readers certain tonalities that others will not hear.\u201d Yet Amichai\u2019s entire body of work speaks persuasively to his powers as an everyman, both of his people and the world. Reviewing The Selected Poetry of Yehuda Amichai, American poet Ed Hirsch stated that Amichai \u201cis a representative man with unusual gifts who in telling his own story also relates the larger story of his people.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nYehuda Amichai died in Jerusalem on September 22, 2000. His papers and archive is housed at the Beinecke Library at Yale University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Israel"]}}
