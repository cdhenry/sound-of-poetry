Gerhardt, along with other artists, helped to create the New Frankfurt School, which was not only satirical but also self-referential. This playful style became popular in Gernhardt\u2019s poetry, prose, and caricatures, which often looked irreverently at cultural and literary traditions.  \u00a0 Gernhardt contributed to the satirical magazine Pardon in the 1960s, and later co-founded another satirical magazine, called Titanic, in 1979. During the next decade, he wrote material for one of Germany\u2019s most popular comedians, Otto Waalkes.  \u00a0 Gernhardt\u2019s awards include the 1983 Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis, an annual award established to recognize outstanding works of children\u2019s literature in Germany, and the Heinrich-Heine Prize, which he was awarded in 2004. In 2006, he received the Wilhem Busch Prize.  \u00a0 Gernhardt died in Frankfurt in 2006, after a long battle with cancer. \ufeff\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Germany"]}}
