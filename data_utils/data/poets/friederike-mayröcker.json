After the war, she taught English in the Viennese public schools until 1969, when she retired and devoted herself to writing full-time. \u00a0 Mayr\u00f6cker\u2019s first poems were published in the avant-garde journal Plan. She is associated with the experimental German writers and artists of the Wiener Gruppe, including the poet Ernst Jandl, her long-term companion, who died in 2000. Mayr\u00f6cker\u2019s body of work is rangy and intense. Her early books include Tod durch Musen (1966); her tribute to Gertrude Stein, Tender Buttons f\u00fcr Selbstm\u00f6rder (1971); and Aria on Feet of Clay: Metaphysical Theater (1972). They show the influence of modernism and assemblage techniques related to the concrete and visual poetry favored by the Wiener Gruppe. Mayr\u00f6cker\u2019s later work draws on her own eclectic reading, daily life, and the scenes and sounds of Vienna\u2014a city she has said she needs to be in to write at all. Her poems have been compared to linguistic collages, mystical or hallucinatory montages of language and experience.  \u00a0 In Poetry Ireland Review, Peter Sirr noted that even the designation avant-garde might not be especially useful for Mayr\u00f6cker: \u201cMayr\u00f6cker\u2019s work is a kind of continuous torrent of freely associative, passionate language in the service of private obsessions,\u201d Sirr wrote. \u201cIn the service, if you like, of the individual lived life rather than the life of the greater social entity. There is nothing specifically national or political in this work, nothing identifiably sociological. Its methods favour the apparently random: the habitual use of collage techniques which layer seemingly disparate levels of experience.\u201d After Jandl\u2019s death, Mayr\u00f6cker wrote in rasende Sprache, or \u201craving language,\u201d attempting to invent an appropriate idiom for grief. She has also cited Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin as an important influence, describing his poetry as a type of drug she takes before writing.  \u00a0 Mayr\u00f6cker has written numerous books of poetry; radio plays, including, with Jandl, F\u00fcnf Mann Menschen (1971); and various performance texts and children\u2019s books. She is the recipient of a Trakl Prize, a Great Austrian State Prize, an Anton Wildgans Prize, a Rowitha Haftmann Prize, an Erich Fried Prize, an America Awards Prize, and a Georg B\u00fcchner Prize.
