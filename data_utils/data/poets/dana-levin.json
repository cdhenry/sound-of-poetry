Her collections of poetry include Banana Palace (2016), Sky Burial (2011), Wedding Day (2005), and In the Surgical Theatre (1999). Selecting Levin\u2019s manuscript for the American Poetry Review/Honickman First Book Prize, Louise Gl\u00fcck praised the work as \u201csensuous, compassionate, violent, extravagant.\u201d In the Surgical Theatre also won the John C. Zacharis First Book Award from Ploughshares, the Witter Bynner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the PEN/Osterweil Award. The New Yorker commented that \u201cSky Burial brings a wealth of ritual and lore from various strains of Buddhism, as well as Mesoamerican and other spiritual traditions \u2026 the intensity and seriousness and openness of her investigations make Levin\u2019s use of this material utterly her own, and utterly riveting.\u201d\nLevin\u2019s free-verse, image-driven poems grapple with the legacies of both Confessionalism and Language poetry by engaging and questioning the self, while using line breaks, punctuation, and syntax as primarily sound-driven tools. The Boston Review described how \u201cin Levin\u2019s hands the fragment becomes a tool of regeneration and self-understanding. It\u2019s as if the very idea of the sentence has to be rethought from the beginning.\u201d In a 2008 interview with the Kenyon Review, Levin herself noted, \u201c[F]or me, imagination is a transpersonal force. Its products can come unbidden; when asked to be employed it is not tame, but surprises, frustrates, stuns, and confounds.\u201d\nLevin\u2019s honors include awards and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rona Jaffe Foundation, the Bread Loaf Writers\u2019 Conference, the Witter Bynner Foundation and the Library of Congress, the Lannan Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the Whiting Foundation. Her work has been widely anthologized and has won several Pushcart Prizes.\nShe lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico and teaches at Maryville University in St. Louis, where she serves as distinguished writer in residence.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
