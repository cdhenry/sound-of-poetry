Influenced by Ted Berrigan and Gertrude Stein, Deanovich composes playful yet formally ambitious elegiac poems that engage themes of connection, sexuality, and time. In an interview with the blog Here Comes Everybody, Deanovich, asked how she would explain what a poem is to a seven-year-old, replied, \u201cI would say words have secrets and special powers. \u2026 [I]t is a poet\u2019s job to discover these secrets and powers. \u2026 A poet puts words together so the secrets and powers can be revealed to anyone who reads the poems.\u201d\nDeanovich\u2019s poetry collections include Zombie Jet (2000)\u00a0and\u00a0Watusi Titanic (1996).
