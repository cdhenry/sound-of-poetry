The originality of his work makes categorization difficult. In his life he avoided becoming involved with literary groups or movements, and unlike other prominent writers of the 1930s\u2014such as W.H. Auden and\u00a0Stephen Spender, for example\u2014he had little use for socialistic ideas in his art. Thomas can be seen as an extension into the 20th century of the general movement called Romanticism, particularly in its emphasis on imagination, emotion, intuition, spontaneity, and organic form. Considered to be one of the greatest Welsh poets of all time, Thomas is largely known for his imaginative use of language and vivid imagery in his poems.\nThomas began writing poetry as a child, and was publishing by his teens. His notebooks from 1930 and 1934, when he was 16 to 20 years old, reveal the young poet\u2019s struggle with a number of personal crises. In his 1965\u00a0Dylan Thomas,\u00a0Jacob Korg described them as \u201crelated to love affairs, to industrial civilization, and to the youthful problems of finding one\u2019s identity.\u201d Revised versions of some of the notebooks\u2019 poems became in 1934 his first published volume of poetry,\u00a0Eighteen Poems. Published in December 1934, it received little notice at first, but by the following spring some influential newspapers and journals had reviewed it favorably.\nLike\u00a0James Joyce\u00a0before him, Dylan Thomas was obsessed with words\u2014with their sound and rhythm and especially with their possibilities for multiple meanings. This richness of meaning, an often illogical and revolutionary syntax, and catalogues of cosmic and sexual imagery render Thomas\u2019s early poetry original and difficult. In a letter to Richard Church,\u00a0Thomas commented on what he considered some of his own excesses: \u201cImmature violence, rhythmic monotony, frequent muddle-headedness, and a very much overweighted imagery that leads often to incoherence.\u201d Similarly, in a letter to Glyn Jones, he wrote: \u201cMy own obscurity is quite an unfashionable one, based, as it is, on a preconceived symbolism derived (I\u2019m afraid all this sounds wooly and pretentious) from the cosmic significance of the human anatomy.\u201d\n\r\nThe Eighteen Poems\u00a0reveal some of Thomas\u2019s key themes, which he was to return to later in his career: the unity of time, the similarity between creative and destructive forces in the universe, and the correspondence of all living things. This last theme was identified by Elder Olson in\u00a0The Poetry of Dylan Thomas\u00a0as part of the tradition of the microcosm-macrocosm: \u201cHe analogizes the anatomy of man to the structure of the universe \u2026 and sees the human microcosm as an image of the macrocosm, and conversely.\u201d\n\r\nDuring the almost two years between the publication of\u00a0Eighteen Poems\u00a0in 1934 and\u00a0Twenty-five Poems\u00a0in 1936, Thomas moved back and forth between London and Wales a great deal. In London he met influential people in the literary world, including Vernon Watkins, an older man whose sedate lifestyle contrasted markedly with Thomas\u2019s. Watkins became a frequent source of money for the continually destitute Thomas. During this period Thomas\u2019s drinking became a serious problem, and his friends would sometimes take him off to out-of-the-way places in Cornwall and Ireland to remove him from temptation with the hope that he would do more writing.\n\r\nThomas\u2019s second volume of poetry,\u00a0Twenty-five Poems,\u00a0was published in September 1936. Most of the poems were revised from the notebooks; Constantine FitzGibbon reported in\u00a0The Life of Dylan Thomas\u00a0that \u201conly six entirely new poems, that is to say poems written in the year and a half between the publication of [Eighteen Poems] and the despatch of the second volume to the printers, are to be found in that volume.\u201d In his Dylan Thomas, Paul Ferris noted that \u201cthe reviews were generally favourable, but with one exception they were not as enthusiastic as they were for [Eighteen Poems].\u201d This exception, however, almost assured the volume\u2019s commercial success; it was a laudatory review by Dame\u00a0Edith Sitwell in the\u00a0Sunday Times.\u00a0As cited by Ferris, the review proclaimed: \u201cThe work of this very young man (he is twenty-two years of age) is on a huge scale, both in theme and structurally. \u2026 I could not name one poet of this, the youngest generation, who shows so great a promise, and even so great an achievement.\u201d\n\r\nThe volume includes a significant sonnet sequence of 10 poems, \u201cAltarwise by owl-light,\u201d written in Ireland the year before publication. In these sonnets Thomas moved from the pre-Christian primitivism of most of the\u00a0Eighteen Poems\u00a0to a Christian mythology based upon love. While much of the attention given to\u00a0Twenty-five Poems\u00a0has been focused on the religious sonnets, the volume as a whole contains indications of a shift in emphasis in Thomas\u2019s writing. Richard Morton noted in\u00a0An Outline of the Works of Dylan Thomas\u00a0that the poems of this volume are \u201cconcerned with the relationship between the poet and his environment,\u201d particularly the natural environment. \u201cIn\u00a0Twenty-five Poems,\u00a0we can see the beginnings of the pastoral mode which reaches its fulfillment in the great lyrics of Thomas\u2019s last poems.\u201d And, as Korg said, \u201cat least three of the poems in the second volume are about the poet\u2019s reactions to other people, themes of an entirely different class from those of [Eighteen Poems]; and these three anticipate [Thomas\u2019s] turning outward in his later poems toward such subjects as his aunt\u2019s funeral, the landscape, and his relations with his wife and children.\u201d\n\r\nSome of the best poems in the book are rather straightforward pieces\u2014\u201dThis bread break,\u201d \u201cThe hand that signed the paper,\u201d \u201cAnd death shall have no dominion\u201d\u2014but others, such as \u201cI, in my intricate image,\u201d are as involved and abstruse as the poems of the earlier volume. Derek Stanford noted that still \u201cthere are traces of doubt, questioning, and despair in many of these pieces.\u201d Thomas, however, chose to place the optimistic \u201cAnd death shall have no dominion\u201d at the end of the volume. This poem has always been one of Thomas\u2019s most popular works, perhaps because, as Clark Emery noted, it was \u201cpublished in a time when notes of affirmation\u2014philosophical, political, or otherwise\u2014did not resound among intelligent liberal humanists, [and thus] it answered an emotional need. \u2026 It affirmed without sentimentalizing; it expressed a faith without theologizing.\u201d\n\r\nThe \u201cAltarwise by owl-light\u201d poems as well as \u201cAnd death shall have no dominion\u201d raise questions concerning the extent to which Dylan Thomas can be called a religious writer. In an essay for\u00a0A Casebook on Dylan Thomas, W.S. Merwin\u00a0was one of the first to deal with this issue; he found Thomas to be a religious writer because he was a \u201ccelebrator in the ritual sense: a maker and performer of a rite \u2026 . That which he celebrates is creation, and more particularly the human condition.\u201d However, the positions on this issue can be\u2014and have been\u2014as various as the definitions of what constitutes a religious outlook. At one end of the scale, critics do not dispute that Thomas used religious imagery in his poetry; at the other end, critics generally agree that, at least during certain periods of his creative life, Thomas\u2019s vision was not that of any orthodox religious system. The range of interpretations was summarized by R.B. Kershner Jr., in\u00a0Dylan Thomas: The Poet and His Critics: \u201cHe has been called a pagan, a mystic, and a humanistic agnostic; his God has been identified with Nature, Sex, Love, Process, the Life Force, and with Thomas himself.\u201d\n\r\nOn July 11, 1937, Thomas married dancer Caitlin Macnamara; they were penniless and lacked the blessings of their parents. After spending some time with each of their reluctant families, they moved to a borrowed house in Laugharne, Wales. This fishing village became their permanent address, though they lived in many temporary dwellings in England and Wales through the war years and after, until Thomas\u2019s death in 1953. The borrowing of houses and money became recurring events in their married life together. Korg associated these external circumstances in the poet\u2019s life with his artistic development: \u201cThomas\u2019s time of settling in Laugharne coincides roughly with the period when his poetry began to turn outward; his love for Caitlin, the birth of his first child, Llewellyn, responses to the Welsh countryside and its people, and ultimately events of the war began to enter his poetry as visible subjects.\u201d\n\r\nThomas\u2019s third book,\u00a0The Map of Love,\u00a0appeared in August 1939, a month before war officially broke out in Europe. It comprised a strange union of 16 poems and seven stories, the stories having been previously published in periodicals. The volume was a commercial failure, perhaps because of the war. Ferris reported that \u201cthe book was respectfully and sometimes warmly reviewed, with a few dissenters\u201d; yet these works of Thomas\u2019s middle period were his least successful.\nIn sharp contrast to the stories in\u00a0The Map of Love\u00a0are those published the following year, 1940, in\u00a0Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog.\u00a0Thomas claimed in a letter to Vernon Watkins that he \u201ckept the flippant title for\u2014as the publishers advise\u2014money-making reasons.\u201d\u00a0These Thomas stories are different from the earlier ones in their particularity of character and place, their straightforward plot lines, and their relevance to Thomas\u2019s childhood in Wales. Thomas wrote to Watkins in August 1939: \u201cI\u2019ve been busy over stories, pot-boiling stories for a book, semi-autobiographical, to be finished by Christmas.\u201d Reviews of the book were mixed, and it didn\u2019t sell well at the time, though it later became enormously popular.\n\r\nThomas avoided service in World War II because of medical problems; he had also considered filing for conscientious objector status. He was able to secure employment during the war years writing documentary scripts for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). While he considered it hack work, it provided the first regular income since his newspaper days and also allowed him to spend a good deal of time in London pubs. This pragmatic writing was the beginning of a career that Thomas pursued until his death; it did not, however, replace what he considered his more important work, the writing of poems. In addition to the documentaries, he wrote radio scripts and eventually screenplays for feature films. Though his income from these activities was moderate, it did not allow him relief from debt or borrowing.\nIn 1940 Thomas began writing\u00a0Adventures in the Skin Trade,\u00a0a novel that he never completed, though its first section was subsequently published. It is essentially the time-honored story of a country boy in the big city. Annis Pratt commented that Thomas intended the story to be \u201ca series of \u2018adventures\u2019 in which the hero\u2019s \u2018skins\u2019 would be stripped off one by one like a snake\u2019s until he was left in a kind of quintessential nakedness to face the world.\u201d\n\r\nThomas\u2019s work next saw publication in a 1946 poetry collection,\u00a0Deaths and Entrances,\u00a0containing many of his most famous poems. This volume included such works as \u201cA Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in London,\u201d \u201cPoem in October,\u201d \u201cThe Hunchback in the Park,\u201d and \u201cFern Hill.\u201d\u00a0Deaths and Entrances\u00a0was an instant success. Ferris noted that 3000 sold in the first month after its publication and that the publisher, Dent, ordered a reprint of the same number.\nH. Jones, in his\u00a0Dylan Thomas,\u00a0declared the volume to be the core of Thomas\u2019s achievement. The poems of\u00a0Deaths and Entrances,\u00a0while still provoking arguments about interpretation, are less compressed and less obscure than the earlier works. Some, like \u201cFern Hill,\u201d illustrate an almost Wordsworthian harmony with nature and other human beings but not without the sense of the inexorability of time. As Jacob Korg said of these poems, \u201cthe figures and landscapes have a new solidity, a new self-sufficiency, and the dialectic vision no longer penetrates them as though they were no more than windows opening on a timeless universe.\u201d\n\r\nWhile these later poems in\u00a0Deaths and Entrances\u00a0are less compressed than the earlier ones, they reveal no less verbal facility or less concern for what is generally called poetic style. Thomas was always a highly individual stylist. Sound was as important as sense in his poems\u2014some would even say more important. He made ample use of alliteration, assonance, internal rhyme, and approximate rhyme. In\u00a0The Craft and Art of Dylan Thomas,\u00a0William T. Moynihan describes his rhythm as \u201caccentual syllabic\u201d: \u201cits stress pattern generally sounds as though it is iambic, but this very justifiable assumption cannot always be borne out by traditional scansion. Thomas may, in fact, have depended upon an iambic expectancy, as he varied his rhythms beyond any customary iambic formulation and then\u2014by completely unprecedented innovations\u2014created his own rhythm, which is very close to iambic.\u201d\n\r\nBy the time of the publication of\u00a0Deaths and Entrances\u00a0Thomas had become a living legend. Through his very popular readings and recordings of his own work, this writer of sometimes obscure poetry gained mass appeal. For many, he came to represent the figure of the bard, the singer of songs to his people. Kershner asserted that Thomas \u201cbecame the wild man from the West, the Celtic bard with the magical rant, a folk figure with racial access to roots of experience which more civilized Londoners lacked.\u201d His drinking, his democratic tendencies, and the frank sexual imagery of his poetry made him the focal point of an ill-defined artistic rebellion.\n\r\nIn 1949 Thomas and his family moved to the Boat House of Laugharne, Wales, a house provided for them by one of Thomas\u2019s benefactors, Margaret Taylor. For the last four years of his life he moved between this dwelling and the United States, where he went on four separate tours to read his poetry and receive the adulation of the American public. The often-sordid accounts of these tours are provided in John Malcolm Brinnin\u2019s\u00a0Dylan Thomas in America.\u00a0Thomas\u2019s last separate volume of poetry before the\u00a0Collected Poems, 1934-1952\u00a0was\u00a0Country Sleep,\u00a0published by New Directions in the United States in 1952. As originally published, this book contained six of the poet\u2019s most accomplished works: \u201cOver Sir John\u2019s Hill,\u201d \u201cPoem on his Birthday,\u201d \u201cDo not go gentle into that good night,\u201d \u201cLament,\u201d \u201cIn the white giant\u2019s thigh,\u201d and \u201cIn country sleep.\u201d Concerning this volume, Rushworth M. Kidder commented in\u00a0Dylan Thomas: The Country of the Spirit\u00a0that \u201cthe fact of physical death seems to present itself to the poet as something more than distant event. \u2026 These poems come to terms with death through a form of worship: not propitiatory worship of Death as deity, but worship of a higher Deity by whose power all things, including death, are controlled.\u201d\nSeveral of Thomas\u2019s film scripts have been published, including\u00a0The Doctor and the Devils\u00a0and\u00a0The Beach at Falesa.\u00a0Neither of these was produced, but they gave Thomas the opportunity to develop his dramatic skills. These skills culminated in his radio play,\u00a0Under Milk Wood,\u00a0written over a long period of time and frantically revised in America during the last months of his life. The play grew out of the story \u201cQuite Early One Morning,\u201d which was broadcast by the BBC in 1945.\u00a0Under Milk Wood\u00a0is set in a small Welsh town called Llareggub and covers one day in the lives of its provincial characters. Raymond Williams, in an essay for\u00a0Dylan Thomas: A Collection of Critical Essays,\u00a0said that\u00a0Under Milk Wood\u00a0is \u201cthe retained extravagance of an adolescent\u2019s imaginings. Yet it moves, at its best, into a genuine involvement, an actual sharing of experience, which is not the least of its dramatic virtues.\u201d Thomas read the play as a solo performance in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 3, 1953; the first group reading was on May 14. The following November, Dylan Thomas died in New York of ailments complicated by alcohol and drug abuse.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Wales"], "School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
