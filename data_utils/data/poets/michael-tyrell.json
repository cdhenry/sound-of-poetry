Writing for the Huffington Post in 2010, critic and poet Ben Evans said of Tyrell\u2019s poetry: \u201cTo capture the voice of a city as immense and diverse as New York, to write its essence, is a challenge taken on by many resident literati. . . . and very few have the ability to communicate the places' ethos. Poet Michael Tyrell is one of those few. Tyrell's poems aren't so much depictions of the city as they are eloquent lamentations of the crowded memories and weary unease it renders.\u201d \u00a0 Tyrell has worked as an assistant poetry and fiction editor at the New Yorker, the awards director of the Academy of American Poets, the national writing program manager for The Scholastic Writing Awards, and for six years he served as an editor of the legendary literary magazine, Chelsea, which published the early work of Sylvia Plath and many artists from Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory.
