Her artist\u2019s book with James Siena, Oaths? Questions?, was published in 2009. Welish has been described as \u201cplayfully and fiercely philosophical.\u201d Her writing is far ranging in its concerns; architecture, grammar, modernity, cultural history, science and mathematics, and much else coalesce in her work to form a kind of \u201cadamant geometry.\u201d  \u00a0 Welish has received numerous honors and awards for her writing, including the Judith E. Wilson Fellowship from the University of Cambridge, the Howard Foundation Fellowship from Brown University, and two fellowships from the New York Foundation for the Arts. She has also been a Senior Fulbright Fellow, teaching at the University of Frankfurt and the Edinburgh College of Art.  \u00a0 As a visual artist, she has exhibited widely and received fellowships from the Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation, the International Studio Program, and the Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts. She was artist-in-residence at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2010. Her art criticism has appeared in numerous magazines and anthologies. A collection of essays about Welish\u2019s work, Of the Diagram: The Work of Marjorie Welish, was published in 2003. Welish is a Distinguished Lecturer and holds the Madelon Leventhal Rand Endowed Chair in Literature at Brooklyn College.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
