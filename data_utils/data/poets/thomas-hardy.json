He died in 1928 at Max Gate, a house he built for himself and his first wife, Emma Lavinia Gifford, in Dorchester, a few miles from his birthplace. Hardy\u2019s youth was influenced by the musicality of his father, a stonemason and fiddler, and his mother, Jemima Hand Hardy, often described as the real guiding star of Hardy\u2019s early life. Though he was an architectural apprentice in London, and spent time there each year until his late 70s, Dorset provided Hardy with material for his fiction and poetry. One of the poorest and most backward of the counties, rural life in Dorset had changed little in hundreds of years, which Hardy explored through the rustic characters in many of his novels. Strongly identifying himself and his work with Dorset, Hardy saw himself as a successor to the Dorset dialect poet William Barnes, who had been a friend and mentor. Moreover, Hardy called his novels the Wessex Novels, after one of the kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon Britain. He provided a map of the area, with the names of the villages and towns he coined to represent actual places.\nBut other features of southern England also influenced Hardy, especially as a poet. Stonehenge was only the most famous of the many remains of the past scattered throughout the English south. There Hardy could explore and contemplate Druid and Roman, ancient and medieval ruins, a fascination which also found expression in later poems like \u201cThe Shadow on the Stone.\u201d Hardy\u2019s interest in history also extended to the Napoleonic Wars, which he considered one of the great events of the historical past; Dorset tradition told of the fear of Bonaparte\u2019s invasion of England. Hardy\u2019s epic, poetical drama The Dynasts (1908) reflects a lifetime of involvement with this historical material, including interviews he conducted with elderly soldiers who had fought in the Napoleonic campaigns. Hardy also visited the field of the battle of Waterloo, where Napoleon\u2019s forces were defeated.\nAlive to the past, as a writer Hardy was also sensitive to the future; scores of younger authors, including William Butler Yeats, Siegfried Sassoon, and Virginia Woolf, visited him, and he discussed poetry with Ezra Pound. Furthermore, Hardy\u2019s well-known war poems spoke eloquently against some of the horrors of his present, notably the Boer War and World War I. In such works as \u201cDrummer Hodge\u201d and \u201cIn Time of \u2018The Breaking of Nations,\u201d Hardy addressed the conflicts in visceral imagery, often using colloquial speech and the viewpoint of ordinary soldiers. His work had a profound influence on other war poets such as Rupert Brooke and Sassoon.\nHardy\u2019s long career spanned the Victorian and the modern eras. He described himself in \u201cIn Tenebris II\u201d as a poet \u201cwho holds that if way to the Better there be, it exacts a full look at the Worst\u201d and during his nearly 88 years he lived through too many upheavals\u2014including World War I\u2014to have become optimistic with age. Nor did he seem by nature to be cheerful: much of the criticism around his work concerns its existentially bleak outlook, and, especially during Hardy\u2019s own time, sexual themes. Incredibly prolific, Hardy wrote fourteen novels, three volumes of short stories, and several poems between the years 1871 and 1897. Hardy\u2019s great novels, including Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilles (1891) and Jude the Obscure (1895), were all published during this period. They both received negative reviews, which may have led Hardy to abandoning fiction to write poetry.\nFrom 1898 until his death in 1928 Hardy published eight volumes of poetry; about one thousand poems were published in his lifetime. Moreover, between 1903 and 1908 Hardy published The Dynasts\u2014a huge poetic drama in 3 parts, 19 acts, and 130 scenes. Using the Napoleonic wars to dramatize his evolving philosophy, Hardy also pioneered a new kind of verse. According to John Wain\u2019s introduction to the 1965 St. Martin\u2019s Press edition of the dramatic poem, in composing The Dynasts Hardy took \u201cone of those sudden jumps which characterize the man of genius. ... He wrote his huge work in accordance with conventions of an art that had not yet been invented: the art of cinema.\u201d The Dynasts, following this view, is \u201cneither a poem, nor a play, nor a story. It is a shooting-script.\u201d Though little read today, The Dynasts presents Hardy\u2019s idea of \u201cevolutionary meliorism,\u201d the hope that human action could make life better. The length and scope of The Dynasts, which was published in three parts over five years, engendered varied, and sometimes bewildered, responses. But by 1908, with the publication of the third part, most reviewers were enthusiastic.\nHowever, Hardy\u2019s lyric poetry is by far his best known, and most widely read. Incredibly influential for poets such as Robert Frost,\u00a0W.H. Auden, Philip Larkin, and Donald Hall, Hardy forged a modern style that nonetheless hewed closely to poetic convention and tradition. Innovative in his use of stanza and voice, Hardy\u2019s poetry, like his fiction, is characterized by a pervasive fatalism. In the words of biographer Claire Tomalin, the poems illuminate \u201cthe contradictions always present in Hardy, between the vulnerable, doomstruck man and the serene inhabitant of the natural world.\u201d Hardy\u2019s lyrics are intimately and directly connected to his life: the great poems of 1912 to 1913 were written after the death of Emma on November 27, 1912. Some of these works are dated as early as December 1912, a month after her death, and others were composed in March of the following year, after Hardy had visited St. Juliot, Cornwall, where he first met Emma. Tomalin described Emma\u2019s death as \u201cthe moment when Thomas Hardy became a great poet,\u201d a view shared by other recent critics. Hardy\u2019s Emma poems, Tomalin goes on to point out, are some the \u201cfinest and strangest celebrations of the dead in English poetry.\u201d Hardy was notorious for his relationships with younger women throughout his life, and he married Florence Dugdale, a woman almost 40 years his junior, shortly after Emma\u2019s death. Hardy\u2019s Emma poems, then, according to Thomas Mallon in the New York Times, are \u201cracked with guilt and wonder.\u201d They are poems in which he attempts to come to terms with the loss of both his wife and his love for her, many years earlier.\nThough frequently described as gloomy and bitter, Hardy\u2019s poems pay attention to the transcendent possibilities of sound, line, and breath\u2014the musical aspects of language. As Irving Howe noted in Thomas Hardy, any \u201ccritic can, and often does, see all that is wrong with Hardy\u2019s poetry but whatever it was that makes for his strange greatness is hard to describe.\u201d Hardy\u2019s poetry, perhaps even more so than his novels, has found new audiences and appreciation as contemporary scholars and critics attempt to understand his work in the context of Modernism. But Hardy has always presented scholars and critics with a contradictory body of work; as Jean Brooks suggests in Thomas Hardy: The Poetic Structure, because Hardy\u2019s \u201cplace in literature has always been controversial, constant reassessment is essential to keep the balance between modern and historical perspective.\u201d Virginia Woolf, a visitor to Max Gate, noted some of Hardy\u2019s enduring power as a writer: \u201cThus it is no mere transcript of life at a certain time and place that Hardy has given us. It is a vision of the world and of man\u2019s lot as they revealed themselves to a powerful imagination, a profound and poetic genius, a gentle and humane soul.\u201d\nWhen Hardy died in 1928, his ashes were deposited in the Poets\u2019 Corner of Westminster Abbey and his heart, having been removed before cremation, was interred in the graveyard at Stinsford Church where his parents, grandparents, and his first wife were buried.\r\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Victorian"]}}
