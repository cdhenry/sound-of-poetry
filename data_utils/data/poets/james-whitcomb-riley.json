Neglectful of his studies, Riley preferred to take walks in the countryside, read books of his own choosing, and create rhymes, the first of which he sent to his young friends on home-made valentines.\nRiley quit school at age 20 and went on to work at various odd jobs, such as selling Bibles and painting houses. He then became a sign painter, and \u201cwhile waiting for the turn of fortune, I covered all the barns and fences with advertisements,\u201d Dickey quoted Riley in\u00a0The Youth of James Whitcomb Riley.\u00a0\u201cAll the while I was nibbling at the rhyme-maker\u2019s trade, and this was a source of irritation to my father. ... He thought I should devote my time exclusively to painting.\u201d Nonetheless, Riley joined a traveling patent-medicine show, where he worked as a sign painter, advertising jingle writer, and minstrel. This gave Riley an opportunity to perform his rhymes and to become an observer of rural life, which would figure prominently in his poetry.\n\r\nIn 1874 Riley began working as an associate editor at the\u00a0Greenfield News,\u00a0and a year later he published a poem in\u00a0Hearth and Home\u00a0magazine. After a stint at his father\u2019s law office, Riley returned to the newspaper business in 1877, when he became an assistant editor at the\u00a0Anderson Democrat.\u00a0Two years later he landed a position with the\u00a0Indianapolis Journal,\u00a0where he wrote book reviews, humorous editorials, and poetry. \u201cThe world with its excellence and follies flows through the reportorial rooms,\u201d Riley remarked in\u00a0The Maturity of James Whitcomb Riley.\u00a0\u201cThus, I was brought into contact with all phases of life. My journalistic work gave me an insight into human nature, which I could have acquired in no other way.\u201d\nRiley also performed his poetry in the lecture circuit, starting at universities and eventually moving to theaters across the country, where he read poetry next to the author Edgar Wilson (Bill) Nye. He charmed audiences with his oratorical skills, and his imitation of rural Indiana dialects earned him the nickname \u201cHoosier Poet.\u201d\nMany of Riley\u2019s poems that were published in the\u00a0Indianapolis Journal\u00a0were later collected in his first book, The Old Swimmin\u2019-Hole and \u2019Leven Other Poems,\u00a0which appeared in 1883. These poems recalled his youth: he wrote about how his mother told him stories, about his excitement when his grandmother or the circus came to town, and about the pond where he used to swim. In poems written expressly for children, Riley playfully misspelled words to reflect the way children often mispronounced them. Riley\u2019s fun-loving approach is evident in this excerpt of one of his most popular poems, \u201cLittle Orphant Annie,\u201d which appeared in\u00a0Riley Child-Rhymes:\u00a0\u201cLittle Orphant Annie\u2019s come to our house to stay, / An\u2019 wash the cups an\u2019 saucers up, an\u2019 brush the crumbs away, / An\u2019 shoo the chickens off the porch, an\u2019 dust the hearth, an\u2019 sweep, / An\u2019 make the fire, an\u2019 bake the bread, an\u2019 earn her board-an\u2019-keep; / An\u2019 all us other childern, when the supper things is done, / We set around the kitchen fire an\u2019 has the mostest fun / A-list\u2019nin\u2019 to the witch-tales \u2019at Annie tells about, / An\u2019 the Gobble-uns \u2019at gits you / Ef you / Don\u2019t / Watch / Out!\u201d\nA prolific writer and important contributor to children\u2019s literature, Riley published more than 50 volumes during his lifetime, many of which were popular successes. His poetry is especially prized for its sometimes whimsical reflection of small-town America and he is remembered for his insight and humor by children and adults alike. As was noted in\u00a0Indiana Authors and Their Books, 1816-1916,\u00a0\u201cNo American poet\u2014those patriarchs of New England included\u2014has thus far caught the popular fancy, has thus far enjoyed the voluntary following, that was and is his.\u201d\nHe passed away in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1916.\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Victorian"]}}
