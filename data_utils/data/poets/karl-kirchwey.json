Rich with mythical and historical allusion, Kirchwey\u2019s formally assured verse explores themes of loss and origin. \u201cArt is the medium by which Kirchwey\u2019s art most often reifies the past\u2014an undertaking of moral gravity, since so much of what he finds is perennial cruelty and violence. Yet what time and again emerges . . . is the poet\u2019s own tenderheartedness,\u201d observed poet Mary Jo Salter in a review of The Engrafted Word for the New York Times.\nKirchwey is the author of several collections of poetry, including Mount Lebanon\u00a0(2011),\u00a0The Happiness of This World: Poetry and Prose (2007); The Engrafted Word (1998), a New York Times Notable Book; and A Wandering Island (1990), recipient of the Norma Farber First Book Award from the Poetry Society of America, as well as Poems Under Saturn (2011), a translation of Paul Verlaine's first book.
