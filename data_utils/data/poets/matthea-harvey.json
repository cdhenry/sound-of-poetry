She attended Harvard University as an undergraduate and earned an MFA in creative writing at the University of Iowa. Her collections of poems include If the Tabloids Are True What Are You? (2014),\u00a0Of Lamb (2011), Modern Life (2007), Sad Little Breathing Machine (2004),\u00a0and\u00a0Pity the Bathtub Its Forced Embrace of the Human Form (2000). She has also published two children\u2019s books:\u00a0Cecil the Pet Glacier (2012),\u00a0illustrated by Giselle Potter, and\u00a0The Little General and the Giant Snowflake\u00a0(2009),\u00a0illustrated by Elizabeth Zechel. In 2017, Harvey was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.\nHarvey draws from a wide variety of sources for her poems: music, scraps of conversation, images, and paintings; she identifies herself as \u201ca general gatherer.\u201d A reviewer on Bookslut.com commented that Harvey is equally a \u201cconductor as she is a poet: much of her work reads as if she\u2019s created a dazzling system and is then pushing language through the structure she\u2019s created.\u201d\nDavid Orr described her poems as containing \u201cdisconnected phrases ...\u00a0abrupt syntactical shifts ...\u00a0quirky diction ...\u00a0and a tone ranging from daffy to plangent\u2014basically two scoops of John Ashbery and a sprinkling of Gertrude Stein.\u201d In his review of Modern Life, Orr described her ability to catch the dread of the political climate post-September 11: \u201cHarvey\u2019s poetry becomes a glass through which we can perceive, darkly, an even greater darkness.\u201d\nHarvey has taught at Sarah Lawrence College, Warren Wilson College, the Pratt Institute, the University of Houston, and the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. She has been contributing editor to jubilat and BOMB. She lives in Brooklyn.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
