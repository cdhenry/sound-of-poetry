(Joseph Charles) Kennedy is known for creating engaging, humorous work that reaches readers of all ages. He noted to\u00a0Contemporary Authors\u00a0that he \u201cwrite[s] for three separate audiences: children, college students (who use textbooks), and that small band of people who still read poetry.\u201d His first poetry book, Nude Descending a Staircase\u00a0(1961), won the Lamont Poetry Prize (now named the James Laughlin Award). He is the author of numerous poetry collections, including Fits of Concision: Collected Poems of Six or Fewer Lines\u00a0(2014), In a Prominent Bar in Secaucus: New & Selected Poems\u00a0(2007), Dark Horses: New Poems (1992), and Breaking and Entering (1971). His many works for young audiences include Exploding Gravy: Poems to Make You Laugh (2002), Elympics (1999), Ghastlies, Goops, and Pincushions: Nonsense Verse (1989), and Brats (1986). While Kennedy\u2019s nonsense verse\u2014in which strange animals are often set in domestic situations\u2014reflects the absurdity of modern life, his more serious children\u2019s poems investigate loss, loneliness, and aching desire.\nKennedy earned a BSc from Seton Hall in 1950 and an MA from Columbia University in 1951. He then worked as a journalist in the US Navy\u2019s Atlantic Fleet for four years. From 1955 to 1956, he studied at the Sorbonne in Paris, France, and from 1957 to 1962, he did graduate work in literature at the University of Michigan. Kennedy was a poetry editor at the Paris Review in the 1960s. He has taught at the University of Michigan, Wellesley, Tufts, Leeds, and elsewhere.\u00a0Kennedy and his wife also collaborated on textbooks and edited a poetry magazine,\u00a0Counter/Measures.\nIt was when Kennedy first sold his poetry, placing two pieces in the\u00a0New Yorker, that he started using a pseudonym. Tired of people joking about him being a relative of Joseph Kennedy, then US ambassador to England and father of future president John F. Kennedy, he added an X onto his name and became X.J. Kennedy.\nIn 1975, Kennedy published One Winter Night in August and Other Nonsense Jingles\u00a0and the reception was warm. In Kirkus Reviews, a critic declared Kennedy\u2019s \u201cbite-sized nonsense rhymes\u201d to be of \u201cmunchy perfection.\u201d In 1979, Kennedy published The Phantom Ice Cream Man: More Nonsense Verse. Donald Hall\u00a0commented in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0that Kennedy displayed \u201ca joy of rhythm here, a joy of rhyme.\u201d Kennedy experimented with alphabetical form in\u00a0Did Adam Name the Vinegarroon? (1982), a bestiary from A to Z with such colorful descriptions as this alliterative rhyme for the mammoth: \u201cA hairy mountain ten feet tall / With peepers moist and misty, / It stood as solid as a wall, / Its twin tusks long and twisty.\u201d\u00a0Alicia Ostriker noted in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review that Kennedy\u2019s alphabet book was \u201ca lively example of its type.\u201d\nKennedy and his wife also collaborated on an anthology of children\u2019s poetry,\u00a0Knock at a Star: A Child\u2019s Introduction to Poetry (1982), which included poems by William Blake, Bob Dylan, and other major figures. Washington Post Book World\u00a0called the collection \u201cCharming, delightful, witty, a treasure of a book.\u201d In 1999, the Kennedys added 75 new poems to the anthology. Carolyn Phelan described the revised version of\u00a0Knock at a Star\u00a0as \u201can admirable book\u201d in\u00a0Booklist.\nIn his poetry collection\u00a0The Forgetful Wishing Well: Poems for Young People (1985), Kennedy explores themes such as loss and growing up. In the poem \u201cGrowing Pains,\u201d he writes: \u201cI take my plastic rocket ship / To bed, now that I\u2019m older. / My wooly bear is packed away, / Why do nights feel colder?\u201d Kirkus Reviews\u00a0called Kennedy\u2019s verse \u201cunassumingly elegant,\u201d and in\u00a0Horn Book, Mary M. Burns concluded, \u201cthese are poems to delight the ear and stimulate the imagination.\u201d\nA departure for Kennedy was his young adult novel The Owlstone Crown (1983), which he wrote over the course of 10 years.\u00a0This detective novel incorporates elements of science fiction. In\u00a0School Library Journal, Anne Connor described it as \u201crich with amusing detail and poetic imagery.\u201d In 1997, Kennedy published a sequel, The Eagle as Wide as the World.\nKennedy\u2019s children\u2019s books of comic verse Brats (1986),\u00a0Fresh Brats (1990), and\u00a0Drat These Brats!\u00a0(1993), written largely in rhymed quatrains and iambic tetrameter couplets, explore the world of mischievous children. This trio of prankish books contain \u201cirrepressibly rhymed verses,\u201d according to Betsy Hearne in the\u00a0Bulletin of the Center for Children\u2019s Books. In Brats, impish Sue sticks a pig to the ceiling with glue: \u201cUncle, gawking, spilled his cup. / \u2018Wow!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Has pork gone up!\u2019\u201d In the\u00a0New York Times Book Review, Peter Neumeyer noted that \u201cKennedy\u2019s humor is sufficiently outrageous to be rib-tickling, rather than frightening.\u201d\nKennedy explored comic verse further with\u00a0Ghastlies, Goops, and Pincushions: Nonsense Verse (1989), a brats companion piece populated by wild characters.\u00a0His book The Kite That Braved Old Orchard Beach: Year-round Poems for Young People\u00a0(1991) is similar to\u00a0The Forgetful Wishing Well\u00a0in its use of simple language to evoke imagery; it is more reflective, however, about such themes as family, friends, and growing up. Kennedy also collaborated with his wife on the 1992 anthology,\u00a0Talking like the Rain: A First Book of Poems. In The Beasts of Bethlehem (1993), 19 poems portray animals gathered around the baby Jesus. With this book, Kennedy \u201ccrowned his rich career,\u201d according to Hearne.\nWith his book Elympics\u00a0(1999), Kennedy introduced young readers to Olympics for elephants, known as the Elympics. This story features Trinket the sprinter, slalom expert Tram, and the diver Elijah. \u201cReaders who remember the sometimes biting wit of the Brats books will find Kennedy\u2019s humor gentler here,\u201d wrote Phelan in\u00a0Booklist. Kennedy returned to the Elympics with the story of Elefantina, an elephant who desperately wants to ice skate, in\u00a0Elefantina\u2019s Dream (2002). Elefantina comes from a tropical climate, so in order to learn to skate, she must not only find some skates and a coach, but also create her own rink to practice on. With the help of the ice man (who loans her blocks of ice so she can create a place to skate) and the mouse coach Mozzarella, Elefantina begins to realize her dream. But she has a jealous rival, and she doesn\u2019t seem to be able to master the salchow jump, a move she must learn in order to make the team. Michael Cart of\u00a0Booklist\u00a0commented that children would \u201cenjoy the element of suspense [and] admire Elefantina\u2019s determination.\u201d In 2002, Kennedy also published the children\u2019s book Exploding Gravy: Poems to Make You Laugh, which was described as \u201ca plethory of poetry\u201d that \u201ctickles the funny bone\u201d in Publishers Weekly.\nKennedy has visited numerous elementary schools, and he is skilled at engaging children. He comments in an article for\u00a0Horn Book, \u201cIn approaching children with poems in our hands, I think it helps to begin by recognizing the child as a person with an intellect.\u201d Kennedy is a champion of meter and rhyme in poetry, and he enjoys calling children\u2019s attention to a poem\u2019s form. In Horn Book he remarks, \u201cI believe that the form of a poem is worth noticing and that it will sometimes evade the child\u2019s gaze unless it is pointed out.\u201d In Contemporary Authors, he explains that his works \u201cdon\u2019t try to persuade children that everything is sweetness and light. Such a view, as even infants know, is pure malarkey. The face of a world, however imaginary, has to have a few warts, if a child is going to believe in it; and it must wear an occasional look of foolishness or consternation. It also needs, I suspect, a bit of poetry, and a dash of incredible beauty and enchantment, if possible.\u201d\nKennedy lives in Bedford, Massachusetts with his family.\n", "attrs": {}}
