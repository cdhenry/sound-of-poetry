Ballard and Patricia L. Hudson. In the introduction, McKinney admits, \u201cI\u2019m a hillbilly, a woman, and a poet, and I understood early on that nobody was going to listen to anything I had to say anyway, so I might as well just say what I want to.\u201d Her lyrical poetry is steeped in the rural Appalachian landscape and frequently explores the connections between people and place. \u00a0 McKinney co-founded the literary journal Trellis with Maggie Anderson and served as an editor for Quarterly West. She also edited the anthology Backcountry: Contemporary Writing in West Virginia (2002). \u00a0 Her honors included fellowships, grants, and residencies from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Bread Loaf Writers Conference, the MacDowell Colony, the West Virginia Commission on the Arts, the Utah Arts Council, and the Kentucky Foundation for Women.

In 1994 she was appointed poet laureate of West Virginia. \u00a0McKinney lived in rural West Virginia. Though a profesor emerita, she taught creative writing part-time at West Virginia Wesleyan College.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
