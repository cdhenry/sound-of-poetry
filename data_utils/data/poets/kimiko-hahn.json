She earned a BA from the University of Iowa and earned an MA in Japanese literature from Columbia University.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHahn is the author of nine books of poetry, including\u00a0The Artist's Daughter\u00a0(2002),\u00a0The Narrow Road to the Interior\u00a0(2006),\u00a0Toxic Flora\u00a0(2010), and\u00a0Brain Fever\u00a0(2014). Reviewing\u00a0Brain Fever\u00a0in the\u00a0Boston Review, Benjamin Landry wrote that Hahn\u2019s \u201cearlier work\u2014wide-ranging in mode and theme\u2014often aspired to the long-form zuihitsu, a diary-like monologue incorporating textbook definitions, email responses, exclamations, recalled speech, loose associations, declarations and reversals. These contemporary zuihitsu evinced an appealing honesty, replicating as they did the mind\u2019s clutter.\u201d Her later work, like that found in\u00a0Toxic Flora\u00a0and\u00a0Brain Fever\u2014both engagements with science articles found in the\u00a0New York Times\u2014\u201cdoes away with much of the clutter. Its anchoring form is the short poem in couplets, with the occasional single-line stanza. These poems glow with concentrated energy, and their dense arrangements usefully contain Hahn\u2019s previous meandering tendencies. Consequently, these new poems exhibit the \u2018gemlike\u2019\u00a0quality Hahn avowedly admires.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHahn is the winner of the PEN/Voelcker Award for Poetry, the American Book Award, and the Shelley Memorial Award\u00a0from the\u00a0Poetry Society of America. She has also been award fellowships from the New York Foundation for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts. Hahn teaches in the MFA program at Queens College. In 2016, she was elected president of the Poetry Society of America.\n", "attrs": {}}
