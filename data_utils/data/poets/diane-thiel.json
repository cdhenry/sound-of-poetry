Many of the poems in Echolocations speak frankly about Thiel\u2019s German heritage and the lineage of trauma brought on by war and violence. Several relate to her parents\u2019 experience of mingling cultures and languages, or to their early lives. John Gery writes in Louisiana Literature that Thiel\u2019s is \u201ca poetry of psychic and cultural artifacts culled from the tiny and the immense, the interior and the distant.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nChristine Stewart-Nu\u00f1ez observed in Prairie Schooner that Thiel\u2019s later collection, Resistance Fantasies, a 2004 National Book Award nominee, \u201cexplore[s] myth and personal story, legends and contemporary public issues.\u2026 Thiel portrays women who resist appearances or conventions, especially the ways myths typically construct them.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nThiel has authored eight books, including The White Horse: A Colombian Journey, a 2004 PEN Southwest Book Award finalist in nonfiction; Writing Your Rhythm (2001); Crossroads: Creative Writing Exercises in Four Genres (2004); Open Roads: Exercises in Writing Poetry (2004); Winding Roads: Exercises in Writing Creative Nonfiction (2007); and Cleft in the Wall (1999). She won an NEA International Literature Award for her translation of American Fugue, Alexis Stamatis\u2019s poetic novel. Her poems have been anthologized widely and have appeared in publications such as Poetry, the Hudson Review, the Sewanee Review, and The Best American Poetry 1999.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThiel has lived in Europe and South America and is fluent in several languages.
