She was born Florence Anthony, and she legally changed her name to Ai which means \u201clove\u201d in Japanese. She said that her given name reflects a \u201cscandalous affair my mother had with a Japanese man she met at a streetcar stop\u201d and has no wish to be identified \u201cfor all eternity\u201d with a man she never knew. Ai\u2019s awareness of her own mixed race heritage\u2014she self-identifies as Japanese, Choctaw-Chickasaw, Black, Irish, Southern Cheyenne, and Comanche\u2014as well as her feminist politics shaped her poetry, which is often unsparing and direct in its subject matter. In the volumes of verse published after her first collection, Cruelty (1973), Ai provoked both controversy and praise for her stark monologues and first-person accounts. Dubbed \u201cAll woman\u2014all human\u201d by confessional poet Anne Sexton, Ai was praised by the Times Literary Supplement for capturing \u201cthe cruelty of intimate relationships and the delights of perverse spontaneity\u2014e.g. the joy a mother gets from beating her child.\u201d Alicia Ostriker countered Sexton\u2019s summation of Ai, writing: \u201c\u2018All woman\u2014all human\u2019; she is hardly that...Woman, in Ai\u2019s embodiment, wants sex. She knows about death and can kill animals and people. She is hard as dirt. Her realities\u2014very small ones\u2014are so intolerable that we fashion female myths to express our fear of her. She, however, lives the hard life below our myths.\u201d\n\r\nAi explained her use of the dramatic monologue as an early realization that \u201cfirst person voice was always the stronger voice to use when writing.\u201d Her poems depict individuals that Duane Ackerson characterized in Contemporary Women Poets as \u201cpeople seeking transformation, a rough sort of salvation, through violent acts.\u201d The speakers in her poems are struggling individuals\u2014usually women, but occasionally men\u2014isolated by poverty, by small-town life, or existence in remote places. Killing Floor (1978), the volume that followed Cruelty, includes a poem called \u201cThe Kid\u201d which is spoken in the voice of a boy who has just murdered his family. Sin (1986) contains more complex dramatic monologues as Ai assumes actual personae, from Joe McCarthy to the Kennedy brothers. Ai\u2019s characters tend to speak in a flat even emotionless demotic register. Poet and critic Rachael Hadas has noted that \u201calthough virtually all the poems present themselves as spoken by a particular character, Ai makes little attempt to capture individual styles of diction [or] personal vocabularies.\u201d For Hadas, however, this makes the poems all the more striking, as her \u201cstripped-down diction conveys an underlying, almost biblical indignation\u2014not, at times, without compassion\u2014at human misuses of power and the corrupting energies of various human appetites.\u201d\nFate (1991) and Greed (1993), like Sin before them, contain monologues that dramatize public figures. Readers confront the inner worlds of former F.B.I. director J. Edgar Hoover, missing-and-presumed-dead Union leader Jimmy Hoffa, musician Elvis Presley, and actor James Dean as voices from beyond-the-grave who remain out of sync with social or ethical \u201cnorms.\u201d Noting that Ai \u201creinvents\u201d each of her subjects within her verse, Ackerson added that, through each monologue, what these individuals say, \u201creturning after death, expresses more about the American psyche than about the real figures.\u201d Vice: New and Selected Poems (1999) contained work from Ai\u2019s previous five books as well as 18 new poems. It was awarded the National Book Award for Poetry. Ai\u2019s next book, Dread (2003), was likewise praised for its searing and honest treatment of, according to a Publishers Weekly reviewer, \u201cviolent or baroquely sexual life stories.\u201d In the New York Times Book Review, Viijay Seshadri wrote that \u201cDread has the characteristic moral strength that makes Ai a necessary poet.\u201d\nAiming her poetic barbs directly at prejudices and societal ills of all types, Ai was outspoken on the subject of race, saying \u201cPeople whose concept of themselves is largely dependent on their racial identity and superiority feel threatened by a multiracial person. The insistence that one must align oneself with this or that race is basically racist. And the notion that without a racial identity a person can\u2019t have any identity perpetuates racism\u2026I wish I could say that race isn\u2019t important. But it is. More than ever, it is a medium of exchange, the coin of the realm with which one buys one\u2019s share of jobs and social position. This is a fact which I have faced and must ultimately transcend. If this transcendence were less complex, less individual, it would lose its holiness.\u201d\nIn addition to the National Book Award, Ai\u2019s work was awarded an American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation, for Sin, and the Lamont Poetry Award of the Academy of American Poets for Killing Floor. During her lifetime she received grants from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Bunting Fellowship Program at Radcliffe College, and the National Endowment for the Arts. She taught at Oklahoma State University. She died in 2010.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
