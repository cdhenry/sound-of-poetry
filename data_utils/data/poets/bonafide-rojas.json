He is the author of four collections of poetry: Pelo Bueno: A Day in the Life of a Nuyorican Poet (Dark Souls Press, 2004), When the City Sleeps (Grand Concourse Press, 2012), Renovatio (Grand Concourse Press, 2012), and Notes on the Return to the Island (Grand Concourse Press, 2017). He founded Grand Concourse Press, named after the thoroughfare he grew up on, in 2012.\nRojas identifies as one of the \u201cnext generation\u201d of Nuyorican poets. In an interview with Gabriela Sierra Alonso, Rojas notes, \u201cI don\u2019t do the salsa thing. I\u2019m a Nuyorican poet, but that\u2019s not my thing. I embrace the Nuyorican label as an artist, and as a poet\u2014because it is a school. \u2026 The truth is that I\u2019m Puerto Rican, and there are many ways to express that\u2014not just by listening to our parents\u2019 music, or going to these hyper cultural events.\u201d\nRojas is the 2002 slam this! champion and has performed on HBO\u2019s Def Poetry Jam as well as in numerous venues in New York City and internationally. His writing appears in journals and anthologies that include Bum Rush the Page: A Def Poetry Jam (Three Rivers Press, 2001) and Role Call: A Generational Anthology of Social & Political Black Literature & Art (Third World Press, 2002). He is a guitar player and leader of the rock group Mona Passage. He lives in New York City and travels frequently to Puerto Rico, where he lectures on poetry with the hope, according to Alonso, \u201cof inspiring the next generation of Nuyorican poets.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Caribbean", "U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
