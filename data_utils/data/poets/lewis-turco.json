A scholar of formal verse, Turco publishes free verse and prose poetry under his own name and formal verse under the anagrammed pseudonym Wesli Court. Regardless of its form, Turco\u2019s poetry offers both wit and concision. Discussing his love for meter and received form with The Nervous Breakdown, Turco stated, \u201cI love to see the language dance and hear it chime. I love to make it do what I want it to do and make it seem easy. I want to make it soar and dive deep into the human situation. I want to be able to do anything at all I wish to do with language.\u201d \u00a0 Turco\u2019s poetry collections include The Airs of Wales (1981), The Green Maces of Autumn: Voices in an Old Maine House (2002), The Collected Lyrics of Lewis Turco/Wesli Court, 1953\u20132004 (2004), Fearful Pleasures: The Complete Poems 1959\u20132007 (2007), and The Gathering of the Elders and Other Poems (2010). His work has been featured in many anthologies, including Patterns of Poetry (1986) and An Exaltation of Forms (2002). \u00a0 Turco is best known for his exhaustive handbook The Book of Forms: A Handbook of Poetics (1986, fourth edition, 2011). He also wrote the handbooks The Book of Dialogue: How to Write Effective Conversation in Fiction, Screenplays, Drama, and Poetry (1989) and The Book of Literary Terms: The Genres of Fiction, Drama, Nonfiction, Literary Criticism, and Scholarship (1999). His Visions and Revisions of American Poetry (1986) won the Poetry Society of America\u2019s Melville Cane Award for Criticism. He is also the author of the children\u2019s book Murgatroyd and Mabel (1978, illustrated by Robert Michaels) and La Famiglia/The Family: Memoirs (2009). \u00a0 Turco was the founding director of the Poetry Center at Fenn College (now Cleveland State University).
