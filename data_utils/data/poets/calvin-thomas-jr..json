There he met influential New Critics like Allen Tate, Mark Shorer, and Yvor Winters, who would later become a mentor. He graduated from Yale in 1951, joined the Air Force, and was sent to Germany. His story \u201cThe Comeback,\u201d which sprang from his experience interviewing German war veterans, was included in Stanford Best Stories. Thomas also wrote poems during this time, he alleged, \u201cwith no plan for them.\u201d He continued, \u201cbut I mailed them off with short stories to [Wallace] Stegner and, to my surprise, learned I\u2019d won the Stanford Fellowship, together with a Thom Gunn, and now belonged to Winters.\u201d\n\r\nThough he never published a book, Thomas had poems accepted in Poetry, The Golden Goose, Sequoia, and the journal Botteghe Oscure. Often drawing on his experiences in the Air Force and his time in Europe, Thomas\u2019s work displays the formal facility associated with New Critic poets like Tate and Winters. The strict rhyme schemes of poems such as \u201cWarning from a Visitor in the Control Tower\u201d and \u201cOn the Crash of an Airliner at Takeoff\u201d belie stark and gruesome images such as the counting up of \u201cbodies broken and all bodies seared\u201d or a control tower guard blinded by fog: \u201cHere in the tower my skeleton will do / to signal you. I am for all your kind / Tonight\u2019s full complement and only crew.\u201d\nThomas left Stanford to pursue a foreign service career and lived in Berlin, Zagreb, Hamburg, Colombo, Bombay, Rabat, New Delhi, Paris, and London. He retired in 1988 and died in 2016, in Arlington, Virginia.\n", "attrs": {}}
