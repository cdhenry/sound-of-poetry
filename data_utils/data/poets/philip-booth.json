His honors include the Theodore Roethke Prize and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Rockefeller, and National Endowment for the Arts. Booth\u2019s work, written in spare language, has garnered critical acclaim for its quiet power. \u201cI can think of few poets,\u201d writes Dave Smith of the Washington Post Book World, \u201cwho give us more clarity, humility, and translucent dimension than [Philip] Booth.\u201d As Poetry\u2019s Robert Seigel notes in a review of Available Light (1976), \u201cBooth continues to cling with fierce, controlled energy to those spare certainties that New Englanders permit themselves on the edge of the Atlantic of the soul.\u201d \u201cBooth\u2019s place,\u201d writes R.W. French in the Nation, \u201cis the Maine coast, and he seems not at all sure that a man can find himself there or anywhere else. ... Booth\u2019s landscapes are ominous, forbidding, and his central metaphor is, significantly, that of the tide.\u201d Commonweal\u2019s Robert Phillips holds that despite Booth\u2019s writing on other subjects, his \u201cbest poems are still the New England poems.\u201d\nSeveral critics call Booth\u2019s spare style of writing perfectly suited to his subjects. Samuel French describes his approach \u201cas unadorned as his landscapes. The lines are short; words seem to be spoken grudgingly, in taut, controlled rhythms.\u201d A reviewer for Choice finds Booth\u2019s style \u201cclean, trimmed of unnecessary words, so that a puritan terseness results that is consonant with the austerity of his thought.\u201d Thomas Lask of the New York Times points out that Booth\u2019s \u201crhythms suggest the slow movements of the tides.\u201d New York Times Book Review contributor Paul Breslin thinks that \u201cBooth\u2019s style, reticent though it is, can be very beautiful.\u201d\nIn a review of Before Sleep (1980), Smith declares that \u201cit may be that one true test of a poet\u2019s writing is that when we have left [his] house of words that house has not left us. Before Sleep stays enormously well.\u201d Phillips likens Booth to an accountant, \u201ctallying up our human losses and gains in poems as deceptively simple as a ledger sheet. In poem after poem, Booth\u2019s universal conclusions are earned by the punctilious particulars which precede them.\u201d A critic for Choice judges Booth to be \u201cone of our best poets.\u201d\nDuring the 1990s, three of Booth\u2019s poetry collections were published: Selves: New Poems (1990), Pairs: New Poems (1994), and\u00a0Lifelines: Selected Poems, 1950-1999. Selves \u201cevokes a world of nameless presences, of invading darkness,\u201d according to Genevieve Stuttaford\u2019s Publishers Weekly review, which states, \u201c[Booth] writes tenderly, wryly ... [and] evinces compassion.\u201d With Pairs, describes Elizabeth Gunderson in a complimentary Booklist review, \u201cBooth elegantly explores each season, attending to how pairs\u2014of people, animals, selves, etc.\u2014interconnect.\u201d \u201c[K]nowledge of both the natural and human worlds typifies Booth\u2019s thorough and unpretentious relation to the place he inhabits. ... One can appreciate the knowledge and the wisdom Booth has gleaned from having kept in close touch with his [Maine] roots,\u201d remarks Richard Tillinghast in a Poetry assessment of Pairs which applauds Booth\u2019s \u201cdisinclination to tailor the poems to a certain theme, or to stretch in his search for unifying elements.\u201d In a Booklist review of Lifelines, Booth\u2019s 1999 compilation of both new and previously published poems, Donna Seaman writes, \u201c[Booth\u2019s] stanzas rise and fall like waves, and his carefully chosen words generate multiple shades of meaning.\u201d A Publishers Weekly writer criticizes the work in Lifelines, commenting that Booth \u201ctoo often ... relies on flat, abstracted exhortation, and on oversimplified psychology;\u201d but, analyzes the critic, this quality might lend itself to those readers \u201cwho will enjoy his attempts to make his verse embody compassion and self-restraint\u2014not to mention his sensitive pictures of Maine.\u201d Haines Sprunt Tate for the Maine Times described the poetry: \u201cA Booth poem feels deliberate, well-crafted.\u201d Tate finished the review of Lifelines: \u201cIt\u2019s a book I\u2019m grateful for.\u201d In the Beloit Poetry Journal Marion K. Stocking described the collection as \u201ca careful crafting of a lifetime\u2019s work into an elegantly integrated organic whole.\u201d Stocking writes that the volume \u201ctraces the arc of the lifetime of consciousness.\u201d\nBooth died in Hanover, New Hampshire, on July 2, 2007.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
