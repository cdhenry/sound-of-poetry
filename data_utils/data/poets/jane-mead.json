Her later work engaged the Western landscape, ecology, and the debts of ancestry: she managed her family\u2019s farm in Northern California, where she grew zinfandel and cabernet wine grapes. In his review of Money Money Money Water Water Water, Jeff Hamilton noted, \u201cMead\u2019s poetic compass, then, leads her not in circles, but toward a horizon of tragic speech,\u201d adding that she \u201cwrites georgics in a confessional mode.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nMead earned a BA at Vassar College, an MA at Syracuse University, and an MFA at the University of Iowa. She received awards and fellowships from the Lannan, Whiting, and Guggenheim foundations. She taught at Colby College, Washington University, the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, the Drew University Low-Residency MFA program, and was for many years poet-in-residence at Wake Forest University.
