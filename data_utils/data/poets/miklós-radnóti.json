He was born in Budapest to Jewish parents. After a stint in his uncle\u2019s textile business, he turned to literature. Inspired by the activities of the Czech and Hungarian avant-gardes, Radn\u00f3ti worked for a number of little magazines in Budapest, and his early poetry is influenced by avant-garde techniques. His first collection of verse, Pog\u00e1ny k\u00f6sz\u00f6nt\u00f5 (Pagan Statue, 1930), however, delved into highly personal symbolism rife with pagan imagery. From 1930\u20131935, Radn\u00f3ti studied Hungarian and French literature at the University of Szeged, forming important friendships with many of interwar Budapest\u2019s most prominent artists and intellectuals. His second book, \u00dajm\u00f3di p\u00e1sztorok \u00e9neke (Song of New-Fashioned Shepherds, 1931), was banned, and Radn\u00f3ti barely escaped imprisonment. He published seven more collections of poetry and one memoir, Ikrek hava (1940; published as Under Gemini in English, 1985), during his lifetime.\nAs the political climate in Hungary darkened, Radn\u00f3ti converted to Catholicism. During the 1930s, he traveled to France with his wife, Fanni Gyarmati, several times. During World War II, he was drafted into forced labor because of his Jewish heritage. He continued to write poems and translate poets such as Apollinaire and Henry de Montherlant as well as essays, fiction, and African folk poetry. Radn\u00f3ti was drafted into a third and final term of forced labor in May 1944. He worked in the copper mines in Yugoslavia; as Soviet troops advanced, Radn\u00f3ti and his fellow prisoners were force-marched in retreat. Weakened from hunger and torture, Radn\u00f3ti collapsed and was shot. His body was dumped into a mass grave. Upon exhumation of the grave a year later, a small notebook containing his final poems was discovered. Radn\u00f3ti\u2019s collected poetry, including his final poems, was published as Tajt\u00e9kos \u00e9g (1946; translated into English as Clouded Sky, 1986). Radn\u00f3ti is recognized as one of the most important poetic witnesses to the Holocaust, and his work has been translated widely and continuously. Recent English editions of his works include All That Still Matters at All (2014, translated by John Ridland and Peter Czipott).\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Eastern Europe"]}}
