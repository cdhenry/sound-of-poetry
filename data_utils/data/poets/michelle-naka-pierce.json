She earned a BA and an MA from the University of New Mexico and an MFA from Naropa University. Continuous Frieze Bordering Red explores identity, migration, and boundaries. About it, Pierce has said, \u201cMy book becomes a kind of meditation of \u2026 my unstable borders, and the color of skin, and this whole notion of migration, being born in Japan, living in the states, then living in London. \u2026 When you occupy that space of not being quite American and not being quite Japanese, the ground is constantly shifting underneath you.\u201d\nPierce has received numerous awards, including a Poets Out Loud Editor\u2019s Prize, a Ted Berrigan Poetry Award, an Aimee Grunberger Memorial Award, and a Blue Mesa Review poetry award. Pierce edits Something on Paper, an online poetics and multimedia journal. She teaches at and serves as dean of the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University. Pierce lives with the poet Chris Pusateri outside of\u00a0Boulder, Colorado.\n", "attrs": {}}
