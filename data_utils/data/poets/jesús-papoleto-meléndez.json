His short-lined, quick-turning poems engage city life through a mosaic of metaphor and song. In a 2013 New York Times article, David Gonzales observes, \u201cThe poems of Jesus \u201cPapoleto\u201d Melendez have a bopping rhythm, where words cascade down the page and\u2014when he recites them\u2014swirl around the room, through the window and out onto the streets of El Barrio. Among the founders of the Nuyorican Poetry Movement, his poems are carefully crafted reflections on urban life, with equal doses of humor, anger, love and absurdity.\u201d \u00a0 Melendez\u2019s poetry collections include Casting Long Shadows (1970), Street Poetry & Other Poems (1972), Concertos on Market Street (1993), and the bilingual volume Hey Yo! Yo Soy! 40 Years of Nuyorican Street Poetry: The Collected Work of Jes\u00fas Papoleto Melendez (2012, volume 1). His work is also featured in Nuyorican Poetry: An Anthology of Puerto Rican Words and Feeling (1975, edited by Miguel Algarin and Miguel Pinero), Bum Rush the Page: A Def Poetry Jam (2001, edited by Tony Medina and Louis Reyes Rivera), and The Norton Anthology of Latino Literature (2011, edited by Edna Acosta-Bel\u00e9n, Harold Augenbraum, Mar\u00eda Herrera-Sobek, Rolando Hinojosa, and Gustavo P\u00e9rez Firmat). His play \u201cThe Junkies Stole the Clock,\u201d was produced by Joseph Papp\u2019s Public Theatre, New York Shakespeare Festival\u2019s Nuyorican Playwrights\u2019 Unit. \u00a0 His honors include a fellowship from the New York Foundation for the Arts, the Louis Reyes Rivera Lifetime Achievement Award, an Artist for Community Enrichment Award from the Bronx Council on the Arts, and a joint fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts and Combined Arts of San Diego.
