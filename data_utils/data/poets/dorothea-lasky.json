In 2019 she published Animal, a book of prose. Lasky\u2019s poems have appeared in a number of prominent publications, including the New Yorker, Paris Review, and American Poetry Review. Known for her colloquial, even slangy style and dramatic readings, Lasky acknowledges that \u201cthere is a kind of arrogance, a kind of supreme power, that when infused with a little real humility and expertise, makes a poem. Because the poem is always about the speaker.\u201d\nLasky also co-wrote Astro Poets: Your Guides to the Zodiac (2019) with the poet\u00a0Alex Dimitrov, and she\u00a0co-writes two monthly columns with him for the magazine\u00a0W.\u00a0She is\u00a0coeditor of Open the Door: How to Excite Young People About Poetry (2013).\nLasky was awarded a Bagley Wright Fellowship in 2013, and she\u00a0is an associate professor of poetry at Columbia University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
