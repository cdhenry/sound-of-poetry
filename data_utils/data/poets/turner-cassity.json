He earned a BA from Millsaps College in 1951, an MA in English from Stanford University in 1952, and a master\u2019s in library science from Columbia University in 1956. From 1962 to 1991, he was the librarian at the Robert W. Woodruff Library at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Cassity is the author of many books of poetry, including No Second Eden: Poems (2002), Hurricane Lamp (1986), The Defense of the Sugar Islands: A Recruiting Post (1979), and Watchboy, What of the Night? (1966). His honors include the Michael Braude Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the Georgia Author of the Year Award by the Georgia Writer\u2019s Association for his poetry collection Devils & Islands (2007).\nCassity\u2019s poetry is renowned for its satiric humor and tight structure. His subject matter is nearly always human nature, frequently within the context of cultural and political tragedy\u2014\u201chuman folly at its most grotesque extremes,\u201d according to Keith Tuma in the Dictionary of Literary Biography. His humor has served as a sort of contradiction to his subject matter, according to Robert Huddleston of the Chicago Review, who described Cassity\u2019s worldview as \u201cexotically formalist, passionately skeptical, [and] dedicatedly agnostic.\u201d In a review of the collection No Second Eden (2002), Prairie Schooner writer Moore Moran noted that \u201cthe poems teem with the satirical prickle that has become a Cassity trademark,\u201d and Booklist contributor Ray Olson called Cassity \u201ca national treasure.\u201d\n\u201cHis is an art by exclusion; his poems are what remains after the completion of a rigorous economizing exercise,\u201d Richard Johnson observed in Parnassus. Writing in the Sewanee Review, Paul Ramsey described the verse of Cassity\u2019s early publication Steeplejacks in Babel (1973) as \u201ctraditional in meter, tight yet ragged,\u201d while Southern Review critic Francis Golfing believed the poems of Yellow for Peril, Black for Beautiful (1975) \u201cbring to mind the surrealistic acrobatics of Cocteau or Picabia.\u201d Jerome J. McGann deemed Cassity a \u201climited poet,\u201d but noted in Poetry that \u201che recognizes perfectly what his words and lines can do, and he performs candidly within his range.\u201d\nCassity received much critical praise for The Destructive Element: New and Selected Poems (1988), a collection that includes works dating as far back as the 1960s. By viewing his career in retrospect, wrote Huddleston, readers are able to \u201cget a synoptic idea of his stylistic development as a writer and the thematic concerns that surface and resurface over time.\u201d Reviewers noted the prevalence of Cassity\u2019s humor based on the poems\u2019 titles alone, which include \u201cLet My People Go, but Not without Severance Pay,\u201d \u201cNever Use a Stock Ticker without a Geiger Counter,\u201d and \u201cVegetarian Mary and the Venus Flytrap.\u201d Contrasting with this humor is Cassity\u2019s tight style. \u201cIf these wonderfully idiosyncratic and cranky poems have failed to appeal to the widest audience,\u201d wrote David Yezzi in Poetry, \u201cthis is chiefly because they run counter to current taste in many ways. Readers accustomed to dewy symbolism, surrealism, or image-rich and \u2018emotionally available\u2019 free verse will find instead hard-bitten formalism and querulously clipped syntax.\u201d Nevertheless, concluded Yezzi, \u201chis humor and understanding are the greater parts of compassion.\u201d\nCassity died in Atlanta, Georgia, in 2009.\n", "attrs": {}}
