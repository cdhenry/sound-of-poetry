Often considered an experimental writer, Tabios discussed what she terms her \u201cabstract poetry\u201d in an interview with Purvi Shah, editor of the Asian Pacific American Journal: \u201cIn poetry, I try to create an emotion that transcends the dictionary sense of what words mean or what they typically evoke in the current cultural context. There are words that are beautiful outside their meaning, like azure or jasmine or cobalt.\u2026 For me, this is partly the place of abstract poetry, in addition to what\u2019s happening in that space between, words, lines, sentences and paragraphs.\u201d Her hay(na)ku poems have been collected in One, Two, Three: Selected Hay(na)ku Poems (2018).\r\n\u00a0\r\nTabios is the author of the short-story collection Behind the Blue Canvas (2004) and works of fiction such as Novel Chatelaine (2009) and Silk Egg: Collected Novels (2009).
