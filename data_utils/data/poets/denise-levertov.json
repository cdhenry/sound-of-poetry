Her work embraced a wide variety of genres and themes, including nature lyrics, love poems, protest poetry, and poetry inspired by her faith in God. \u201cDignity, reverence, and strength are words that come to mind as one gropes to characterize \u2026 one of America\u2019s most respected poets,\u201d wrote Amy Gerstler in the Los Angeles Times Book Review, adding that Levertov possessed \u201ca clear uncluttered voice\u2014a voice committed to acute observation and engagement with the earthly, in all its attendant beauty, mystery and pain.\u201d Levertov was born in England and came to the United States in 1948; during her lifetime she was associated with Black Mountain poets such as Robert Duncan and Robert Creeley. Invested in the organic, open-form procedures of William Carlos Williams, Levertov\u2019s body of quietly passionate poems, attuned to mystic insights and mapping quests for harmony, became darker and more political in the 1960s as a result of personal loss and her political activism against the Vietnam War. In Modern American Women Poets, Jean Gould called Levertov \u201ca poet of definite political and social consciousness.\u201d However, Levertov refused to be labeled, and Kenneth Rexroth once described her as \u201cin fact classically independent.\u201d\n\r\nLevertov was born and raised in Ilford in Essex, England. Levertov and her older sister, Olga, were educated by their Welsh mother, Beatrice Adelaide Spooner-Jones, at home. The girls further received sporadic religious training from their father, Paul Philip Levertoff, a Russian Jew who converted to Christianity and subsequently moved to England and became an Anglican minister. Because Levertov never received a formal education, her earliest literary influences can be traced to her home life. In the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Carolyn Matalene explained that \u201cthe education [Levertov] did receive seems, like Robert Browning\u2018s, made to order. Her mother read aloud to the family the great works of 19th-century fiction, and she read poetry, especially the lyrics of Tennyson. \u2026 Her father, a prolific writer in Hebrew, Russian, German, and English, used to buy secondhand books by the lot to obtain particular volumes. Levertov grew up surrounded by books and people talking about them in many languages.\u201d Levertov\u2019s lack of formal education has been alleged to result in verse that is consistently clear, precise, and accessible. According to Doris Earnshaw, \u201cLevertov seems never to have had to shake loose from an academic style of extreme ellipses and literary allusion, the self-conscious obscurity that the Provencal poets called \u2018closed.\u2019\u201d\nLevertov had confidence in her poetic abilities from the beginning, and several well-respected literary figures believed in her talents as well. Gould recorded Levertov\u2019s \u201ctemerity\u201d at the age of 12 when she sent several of her poems directly to T.S. Eliot: \u201cShe received a two-page typewritten letter from him, offering her \u2018excellent advice.\u2019 \u2026 His letter gave her renewed impetus for making poems and sending them out.\u201d Other early supporters included critic Herbert Read, editor Charles Wrey Gardiner, and Kenneth Rexroth. When Levertov had her first poem published in Poetry Quarterly in 1940, Rexroth professed: \u201cIn no time at all Herbert Read, Tambimutti, Charles Wrey Gardiner, and incidentally myself, were all in excited correspondence about her. She was the baby of the new Romanticism. Her poetry had about it a wistful Schwarmerei unlike anything in English except perhaps Matthew Arnold\u2019s \u2018Dover Beach.\u2019 It could be compared to the earliest poems of Rilke or some of the more melancholy songs of Brahms.\u201d\nDuring World War II, Levertov pursued nurse\u2019s training and spent three years as a civilian nurse at several hospitals in the London area, during which time she continued to write poetry. Her first book of poems, The Double Image (1946), was published just after the war. Although a few poems in this collection focus on the war, there is no direct evidence of the immediate events of the time. Instead, as noted above by Rexroth, the work is very much in keeping with the British neo-romanticism of the 1940s: it contains formal verse that some considered artificial and overly sentimental. Criticism aside, Gould said The Double Image revealed one thing for certain: \u201cthe young poet possessed a strong social consciousness and \u2026 showed indications of the militant pacifist she was to become.\u201d Critics detected the same propensity for sentimentality in Levertov\u2019s second collection, Here and Now (1957), considered to be her first \u201cAmerican\u201d book.\nLevertov came to the United States after marrying American writer Mitchell Goodman, and she began developing the style that was to make her an internationally respected American poet. Some critics maintain that her first American poetry collection, Here and Now, contains vestiges of the sentimentalism that characterized her first book, but for some, Here and Now displays Levertov\u2019s newly found American voice. Rexroth, for one, insisted in his 1961 collection of essays titled Assays that \u201cthe Schwarmerei and lassitude are gone. Their place has been taken by a kind of animal grace of the word, a pulse like the footfalls of a cat or the wingbeats of a gull. It is the intense aliveness of an alert domestic love\u2014the wedding of form and content. \u2026 What more do you want of poetry? You can\u2019t ask much more.\u201d Gould claimed that by the time With Eyes at the Back of Our Heads (1959) was published, Levertov was \u201cregarded as a bona fide American poet.\u201d\n\r\nLevertov\u2019s American poetic voice was, in one sense, indebted to the simple, concrete language and imagery, and also the immediacy, characteristic of Williams. Accordingly, Ralph J. Mills Jr. remarked in his essay in Poets in Progress that Levertov\u2019s verse \u201cis frequently a tour through the familiar and the mundane until their unfamiliarity and otherworldliness suddenly strike us. \u2026 The quotidian reality we ignore or try to escape, \u2026 Levertov revels in, carves and hammers into lyric poems of precise beauty.\u201d In turn, Midwest Quarterly reviewer Julian Gitzen explained that Levertov\u2019s \u201cattention to physical details [permitted her] to develop a considerable range of poetic subject, for, like Williams, she [was] often inspired by the humble, the commonplace, or the small, and she [composed] remarkably perceptive poems about a single flower, a man walking two dogs in the rain, and even sunlight glittering on rubbish in a street.\u201d\n\r\nIn another sense, Levertov\u2019s verse exhibited the influence of the Black Mountain poets, such as Robert Duncan, Charles Olson, and Robert Creeley, whom Levertov met through her husband. Cid Corman was among the first to publish Levertov\u2019s poetry in the United States in Origin in the 1950s. Unlike her early formalized verse, Levertov now gave homage to the projectivist verse of the Black Mountain era, whereby the poet \u201cprojects\u201d through content rather than through strict meter or form. Although Levertov was assuredly influenced by several renowned American writers of the time, Matalene believed Levertov\u2019s \u201cdevelopment as a poet [had] certainly proceeded more according to her own themes, her own sense of place, and her own sensitivities to the music of poetry than to poetic manifestos.\u201d Indeed, Matalene explained that when Levertov became a New Directions author in 1959, it was because editor James Laughlin had detected in Levertov\u2019s work her own unique voice.\n\r\nWith the onset of the United States\u2019 involvement in Vietnam during the 1960s, Levertov\u2019s social consciousness began to more completely inform both her poetry and her private life. With Muriel Rukeyser and several other poets, Levertov founded the Writers and Artists Protest against the War in Vietnam. She took part in several anti-war demonstrations in Berkeley, California, and elsewhere, and was briefly jailed on numerous occasions for civil disobedience. In the ensuing decades she spoke out against nuclear weaponry, American aid to El Salvador, and the Persian Gulf War. The Sorrow Dance (1967), Relearning the Alphabet (1970), To Stay Alive (1971), and, to an extent, Candles in Babylon (1982), as well as other poetry collections, address many social and political themes such as the Vietnam War, the Detroit riots, and nuclear disarmament. Her goal was to motivate others into an awareness of these various issues, particularly the Vietnam War and ecological concerns.\n\r\nIn contrast with the generally favorable criticism of her work, contemporary commentators tended to view Levertov\u2019s overtly political poems skeptically, often noting that they resembled prose more than poetry. In Contemporary Literature, Marjorie G. Perloff wrote: \u201cIt is distressing to report that \u2026 Levertov\u2019s new book, To Stay Alive, contains a quantity of bad confessional verse. Her anti-Vietnam War poems, written in casual diary form, sound rather like a versified New York Review of Books.\u201d And Matalene noted that \u201cTo Stay Alive is a historical document and does record and preserve the persons, conversations, and events of those years. Perhaps, as the events recede in time, these poems will seem true and just, rather than inchoate, bombastic, and superficial. History, after all, does prefer those who take stands.\u201d In a Poetry magazine essay, Paul Breslin stated, \u201cEven in the early poems, there is a moralizing streak \u2026 and when she engaged, as so many poets did, with the Vietnam War, the moralist turned into a bully: I agreed with her horrified opposition to the war, but not with her frequent suggestion that poets are morally superior because they are poets, and therefore charged with lecturing the less sensitive on their failures of moral imagination.\u201d\n\r\nContributor Penelope Moffet explained that in an interview with Levertov in Los Angeles Times Book Review just prior to the publication of Candles in Babylon, Levertov \u201cprobably would not go so far as to describe any of her own political work as \u2018doggerel,\u2019 but she does acknowledge that some pieces are only \u2018sort-of\u2019 poems.\u201d Moffet then quoted Levertov: \u201cIf any reviewer wants to criticize [Candles in Babylon] when it comes out, they\u2019ve got an obvious place to begin\u2014\u2019well, it\u2019s not poetry, this ranting and roaring and speech-making.\u2019 It [the 1980 anti-draft speech included in Candles in Babylon] was a speech.\u201d Nevertheless, other critics were not so quick to find fault with these \u201csort-of\u201d poems. In the opinion of Hayden Carruth, writing in Hudson Review, To Stay Alive \u201ccontains, what so annoys the critics, highly lyric passages next to passages of prose\u2014letters and documents. But is it, after Paterson, necessary to defend this? The fact is, I think Levertov [had] used her prose bits better than Williams did, more prudently and economically \u2026 I also think that To Stay Alive is one of the best products of the recent period of politically oriented vision among American poets.\u201d\nDiane Wakoski, reviewing Levertov\u2019s volume of poems Breathing the Water (1987), in Women\u2019s Review of Books, stressed the religious elements in Levertov\u2019s work. \u201cLevertov\u2019s poetry,\u201d Wakoski stated, \u201clike most American mysticism, is grounded in Christianity, but like Whitman and other American mystics her discovery of God is the discovery of God in herself, and an attempt to understand how that self is a \u2018natural\u2019 part of the world, intermingling with everything pantheistically, ecologically, socially, historically and, for Levertov, always lyrically.\u201d Doris Earnshaw seemed to echo Wakoski in her review of Levertov\u2019s volume A Door in the Hive (1989) in World Literature Today. Earnshaw felt that Levertov\u2019s poems are \u201ctruly lyrics while speaking of political and religious affairs.\u201d The central piece of A Door in the Hive is \u201cEl Salvador: Requiem and Invocation,\u201d a libretto composed as a requiem for Archbishop Romero and four American women who were killed by death squads in El Salvador in the early 1980s. Emily Grosholz stated in Hudson Review that while this is \u201cnot a poem, [it] is a useful kind of extended popular song whose proceeds served to aid important relief and lobbying efforts; such writing deserves a place side by side with Levertov\u2019s best poetry. And indeed, it is flanked by poems that rise to the occasion.\u201d\n\r\nIn a discussion of Levertov\u2019s volume Evening Train (1992), reviewer Daisy Aldan believed the \u201ccollection reveals an important transition toward what some have called \u2018the last plateau\u2019: that is, the consciousness of entering into the years of aging, which she [experienced] and [expressed] with sensitivity and grace.\u201d Mark Jarman described the book in Hudson Review as \u201ca long sequence about growing older, with a terrific payoff. This is the best writing she [has] done in years.\u201d Evening Train consists of individually titled sections, beginning with the pastoral \u201cLake Mountain Moon\u201d and ending with the spiritually oriented \u201cThe Tide.\u201d In between, Levertov deals both with problems of personal conscience and social issues, such as AIDS, the Gulf War, pollution, and the ongoing threat of nuclear annihilation. Los Angeles Times Book Review contributor Amy Gerstler stated that all of the poems \u201cblend together to form one long poem,\u201d and credited Levertov with possessing \u201ca practically perfect instinct for picking the right distance to speak from: how far away to remain from both reader and subject, and how much of an overt role to give herself in the poem.\u201d Aldan concluded that the poems in Evening Train \u201cmanifest a new modesty, a refinement, sensibility, creative intelligence, compassion and spirituality.\u201d\n\r\nIn addition to being a poet, Levertov taught her craft at several colleges and universities nationwide; she translated a number of works, particularly those of the French poet Jean Joubert; she was poetry editor of the Nation from 1961-62 and Mother Jones from 1976-78; and she authored several collections of essays and criticism, including The Poet in the World (1973), Light up the Cave (1981), and New & Selected Essays (1992). Levertov\u2019s essays ranged over poetics, aesthetics, and politics. According to Carruth, The Poet in the World is \u201ca miscellaneous volume, springing from many miscellaneous occasions, and its tone ranges from spritely to gracious to, occasionally, pedantic. It contains a number of pieces about the poet\u2019s work as a teacher; it contains her beautiful impromptu obituary for William Carlos Williams, as well as reviews and appreciations of other writers. But chiefly the book is about poetry, its mystery and its craft, and about the relationship between poetry and life. \u2026 It should be read by everyone who takes poetry seriously.\u201d The essays in Light up the Cave, in turn, were considered \u201ca diary of our neglected soul\u201d by American Book Review critic Daniel Berrigan: \u201cNorman Mailer did something like this in the sixties; but since those heady days and nights, he, like most such marchers and writers, has turned to other matters. \u2026 Levertov [is] still marching, still recording the march.\u201d New & Selected Essays brought together essays dating from 1965 to 1992 and included topics such as politics, religion, the influence of other poets on Levertov, the poetics of free verse, the limits beyond which the subject matter of poetry should not go, and the social obligations of the poet. Essays on poets who influenced Levertov cover William Carlos Williams, Robert Duncan, and Rainer Maria Rilke. Mary Kaiser, writing in World Literature Today, said of the collection: \u201cWide-ranging in subject matter and spanning three decades of thought, Levertov\u2019s essays show a remarkable coherence, sanity, and poetic integrity.\u201d Booklist writer Ray Olsen concluded, \u201cNext to poetry itself, this is ideal reading for lovers of poetry.\u201d\n\r\nLevertov\u2019s 1995 work, Tesserae: Memories and Suppositions, contained 27 autobiographical prose essays. The title, \u201ctesserae,\u201d refers to the pieces that make up a mosaic, but as Levertov pointed out in her introduction to the work, \u201cThese tesserae have no pretensions to forming an entire mosaic.\u201d Instead of a full-scale memoir, the pieces reflect distinct memories about the author\u2019s parents, her youth, and her life as a poet. Reviewers remarked on the lyrical quality of Levertov\u2019s prose and on her spare, contained memories. A Publishers Weekly reviewer stated that Levertov\u2019s \u201cability to relate an incident is at once timeless and immediate, boundless and searingly personal.\u201d\n\r\nLevertov died of lymphoma at the age of 74. Almost until the moment of her death she continued to compose poetry, and some forty of them were published posthumously in This Great Unknowing: Last Poems (1999). The work, while retaining an elegiac feel, also displays \u201cthe passion, lyrical prowess, and spiritual jubilation\u201d that informed the end of Levertov\u2019s life, noted a reviewer in Sojourners. Noting that the book ranges from \u201cthe specifically personal to the searchingly mystical,\u201d a Publishers Weekly critic felt that it rises \u201cto equal the splendor of Levertov\u2019s humane vision.\u201d Posthumous collections of Levertov\u2019s work include Poems: 1972-1982 (2001), The Letters of Denise Levertov and William Carlos Williams, edited by Christopher MacGowan (1998). The Letters of Robert Duncan and Denise Levertov, edited by Robert J. Bertholf and Albert Gelpi (2003) won the Morton N. Cohen Award for a Distinguished Edition of Letters.\n\r\nDiscussing Levertov\u2019s social and political consciousness in his review of Light up the Cave, Berrigan stated: \u201cOur options [in a tremulous world], as they say, are no longer large. \u2026 [We] may choose to do nothing; which is to say, to go discreetly or wildly mad, letting fear possess us and frivolity rule our days. Or we may, along with admirable spirits like Denise Levertov, be driven sane; by community, by conscience, by treading the human crucible.\u201d A contributor in Concise Dictionary of American Literary Biography commended Levertov for \u201cthe emphasis in her work on uniting cultures and races through an awareness of their common spiritual heritage and their common responsibility to a shared planet.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Black Mountain"]}}
