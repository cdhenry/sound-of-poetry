When he was eight years old, his family moved back to western North Carolina, a region where Rash\u2019s ancestors had lived since the mid-1700s. Rash\u2019s father went to night school in order to complete a college degree and later became a college professor at Gardner-Webb University, in Boiling Springs, where Rash himself would later earn his BA.\nRash returned to South Carolina to earn his MA from Clemson University, where he met and married his wife, a fellow student. He then taught writing at TriCounty Technical College in South Carolina and Queens College in North Carolina. In an interview with Jack Shuler, for the\u00a0South Carolina Review,\u00a0Rash stated, \u201cI don\u2019t like living in cities.\u2019\u2019 Rash\u2019s poetry and fiction focuses on the lives of people in rural, southern settings.\nWhen asked by Shuler to identify the themes of his writing, Rash responded, \u201ca lot of my imagery is religious.\u201d He then clarified by explaining that although his work is \u201cChrist-haunted,\u2019\u2019 it also contains some pagan imagery. One of his favorite themes, Rash said, is the meeting of paganism and Christianity, such as when an Appalachian Christian farmer kills \u201cblack snakes ... to make it rain.\u201d Another of his themes is \u201cthings that are vanishing or gone,\u201d such as southern lifestyles that are fading out of existence. To balance these themes of impermanence, Rash also uses natural metaphors, such as \u201ca blade of grass or a waterfall,\u201d things that will be understood by a reader 200 years from now, \u201cbecause nature is universal.\u201d\nInfluenced by poet Gerard Manley Hopkins, Rash\u2019s narrative, image-laden poems spring from his Appalachian heritage. In an essay for the\u00a0South Carolina Review, critic Matthew Boyleston praised the \u201cmusic and thick resonance\u201d of Rash\u2019s poetry, observing that \u201cas C.S. Lewis usefully said of Tolkien, \u2018he had been inside the language.\u2019 In an essential way, Rash has been inside the dialect.\u201d In his essay\u00a0The Importance of Place, Rash noted, \u201cThe best regional writers are like farmers drilling for water: if they bore deep and true enough into that particular place, beyond the surface of local color, they tap into universal correspondences.\u201d\nRash\u2019s first published work was\u00a0The Night the New Jesus Fell to Earth and Other Stories from Cliffside, North Carolina\u00a0(1994).\u00a0The stories in this collection are told through the voices of a chicken farmer, a carpenter, and a man who has recently returned home to visit his mother. The three characters come together one night and share their visions of what the town of Cliffside means to them, what the town\u2019s past has been, what might lie ahead for the community, and the effect it and its southern culture has had upon their own lives. Gilbert Allen, a writer for the\u00a0Georgia Review,\u00a0commended Rash for creating \u201cmemorable voices and a host of unforgettable images.\u201d Rash won the Sherwood Anderson Award in 1996, two years after the publication of this collection.\nIn 1998, Rash published\u00a0Eureka Mill,\u00a0a collection of poetry. He took the title of this collection from the name of the textile mill where his mother and father worked at the time of his birth. \u201cIt\u2019s such an ironic name,\u201d Rash told Shuler in his interview, because the Greek word\u00a0eureka\u00a0means \u201c\u2018I have found it.\u2019 What they [his parents] found there were hard times.\u201d The poems in this collection deal with the lives of people who work in the mills: this is a culture that is disappearing from South Carolina, in many ways for the better. Rash points out the hard labor involved, the physical hazards, and the loss of personal and family connections. One of the main characters in these poems is Rash\u2019s grandfather, who moved away from the North Carolina mountains during the early part of the 19th century to work in the mills of South Carolina. Describing Rash\u2019s work in this collection, a writer for the\u00a0South Carolina Review,\u00a0G.C. Waldrep, commented, \u201cMost of\u00a0Eureka Mill\u00a0is composed in a kind of homestitched tetrameter, regular as the warp and weft of Oxford cloth and just as seamless.\u201d\u00a0Robert West of\u00a0Carolina Quarterly\u00a0also commented on the meter of Rash\u2019s poems in this collection, reflecting that it is the meter than helps set \u201cits solemn tone.\u201d West also found Rash\u2019s second publication to stand in stark contrast to his first book,\u00a0The Night the New Jesus Fell to Earth,\u00a0which West described as a \u201chilarious story collection.\u201d\nRash\u2019s third book, the poetry collection Among the Believers\u00a0(2000), is set in the mountains of western North Carolina and focuses on rural, everyday life. The poems, taken as a whole, have been compared to a short story or a novella by several critics. The themes of hard living and death in the lives of its characters tie the poems together and offer a full picture of life in the southern mountains. A writer for the\u00a0Sewanee Review\u00a0suggested that the poems be read \u201cone by one in the sequence in which they unfold.\u201d In this way, the reviewer suggested, the reader will gain the full impact of the storytelling power of this collection. Anthony Hecht, who wrote the foreword for Rash\u2019s collection, is quoted in the\u00a0American Poet\u00a0praising not only Rash\u2019s ability to tell a story through his poetry, but also his \u201cremarkable skill ... his dramatic instincts, stoic voice, and deep humanity.\u201d The collection also shows Rash\u2019s deepening interest in traditional Welsh poetics.\nIn the same year that\u00a0Among the Believers\u00a0was published, Rash also published his second collection of short stories,\u00a0Casualties\u00a0(2000).\u00a0The stories again reflect life in the South, both during earlier times and in conflicts between the present and the past. Although the title suggests some kind of war aftermath, the casualties in Rash\u2019s stories all relate to the realm of love\u2014the death of a son and the effect it has on his mother; a son coming to terms with his father\u2019s depression\u2014themes that are ancient and mythological in scope.\nRash published two books in 2002:\u00a0Raising the Dead,\u00a0his fourth collection of poems, and\u00a0One Foot in Eden,\u00a0his first novel.\u00a0One Foot in Eden\u00a0won the Novello Festival Press Literary Award in January 2002. Amy Rogers, an executive editor for Novello Press, told Ann Wicker, of the online\u00a0Charlotte Creative Loafing\u00a0that Rash\u2019s book won because it has \u201cthat all-too-rare combination of compelling characters and a page-turning plot\u2014in a story of love, loss, and sacrifice.\u201d He followed these books with the novel Saints at the River (2004) and Chemistry and Other Stories (2007), which was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction.\nRash\u2019s themes of everyday southern life and the losses experienced by its people came out in the novel\u00a0Serena\u00a0(2008), which was a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0bestseller, a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction, and was adapted into a feature film in 2014. In the\u00a0New York Times,\u00a0Janet Maslin writes that\u00a0Serena\u00a0\u201cestablished [Rash] as one of the best American novelists of his day. With its stark Appalachian setting, piercing language, and coolly ferocious title character,\u00a0Serena\u00a0was a big book filled with bleakly beautiful details.\u201d\nRash is the two-time winner of the O. Henry Prize and the winner of the James Still Award from the Fellowship of Southern Writers. He has published the short story collections\u00a0Something Rich and Strange\u00a0(2014),\u00a0Nothing Gold Can Stay\u00a0(2013), and\u00a0Burning Bright\u00a0(2011), which won the Frank O\u2019Connor International Short Story Award, and the novels The Risen\u00a0(2016),\u00a0Above the Waterfall\u00a0(2015), and\u00a0The Cove\u00a0(2012), all of which further established him as the leading writer of the Appalachian region.\nRash\u2019s poetry collections include Poems: New and Selected\u00a0(2016) and\u00a0Waking\u00a0(2011) and he has won a General Electric Young Writers Award, the Academy of American Poets Prize, and a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. His poetry has been featured in Ted Kooser\u2019s\u00a0The Poetry Home Repair Manual: Practical Advice for Beginning Poets\u00a0(2005). He is the John Parris Distinguished Professor of Appalachian Studies at Western Carolina University and lives in North Carolina.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"]}}
