With humor and raw vulnerability, Chin\u2019s poems interrogate the personal, political, and commercial implications of claiming a queer Asian American identity. Fiercely political, Chin stated in an interview with Frigate\u00a0magazine, \u201cEvery work of art that works as art is a critique.\u201d\n\r\nChin was the author of several collections of poetry, including Bite Hard (1997), Harmless Medicine (2001), and Gutted (2006), which won the Publishing Triangle\u2019s Thom Gunn Award for Poetry and was a finalist for a Lambda Literary Award. His prose collections, which weave criticism with memoir and fiction, include Mongrel: Essays, Diatribes, & Pranks (1998), Burden of Ashes (2002),\u00a0Attack of the Man-Eating Lotus Blossoms (2005), and 98 Wounds\u00a0(2011).
