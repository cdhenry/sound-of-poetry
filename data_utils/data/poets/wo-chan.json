In a 2015 interview with poet Christopher Soto for Lambda Literary, Chan discusses the connection between beauty and poetry in the context of their experience working as a makeup artist. Drawing a distinction between the cosmetics industry and beauty, Chan states, \u201cThe feeling and seeing of beauty is something every poet has to navigate when they begin to actualize form and rhythms on the page. In this way, I am most interested in the sensation of beauty that arises in poetry, and how it always dual orbits an emotion\u2014constantly falling away and into its subject. Melancholic beauty, ecstatic beauty, absurd beauty! Conversely, writing where beauty purposely escapes feeling becomes difficult for me.\u201d Their poems have appeared in cream city review, VYM: The Drag Magazine, and Barzakh.\nChan is the recipient of fellowships from Kundiman, Poets House, the Lambda Literary Foundation, Poets & Writers, and the Asian American Writers\u2019 Workshop. They served as a program assistant for Poets & Writers and a communications assistant for Kundiman. They live\u00a0in Brooklyn and are a member of the Brooklyn-based drag alliance Switch n\u2019 Play.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic", "Pacific Islands"]}}
