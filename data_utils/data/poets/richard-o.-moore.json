Moore, a documentary filmmaker for public television, was one of the founders of KPFA\u2014the first publicly supported radio station in the United States. He was born in Alliance, Ohio, and attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied poetry with\u00a0Josephine Miles. He was associated with the San Francisco Renaissance and frequented\u00a0Kenneth Rexroth\u2019s Friday meetings for poets, philosophers, and poetry aficionados. During World War II, Moore was classified 4-F and counseled conscientious objectors. He wrote poetry for decades but shared little of it until poet\u00a0Brenda Hillman\u00a0encouraged him to publish. In 2010, Hillman and Paul Ebenkamp edited Moore\u2019s book\u00a0Writing the Silences, a collection representing more than 60 years of his work. A second collection,\u00a0Particulars of Place, was published by Omnidawn in 2015.Moore\u2019s early exposures to Miles\u2019s teachings, Rexroth\u2019s poetry, and philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein all influenced his writing. Hillman, in her foreword to\u00a0Writing the Silences, explains that \u201cMoore developed a signature style of poetry: open, spare verse that foregrounds philosophical inquiry.\u201d\u00a0Writing the Silences\u00a0was a Northern California Book Award nominee.Moore lived in The Redwoods in northern California, where he and other like-minded residents of the retirement community protested the war in Iraq once a week. He died in 2015.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
