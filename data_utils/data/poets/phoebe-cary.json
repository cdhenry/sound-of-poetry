Both sisters immersed themselves in the classics of literature under the tutelage of an older sister whose death in 1833 affected them deeply. Although Phoebe and Alice published poems while still teenagers, it wasn\u2019t until 1850, after their work had been noticed by such luminaries as Edgar Allan Poe and John Greenleaf Whittier, that they published their book, Poems of Alice and Phoebe Cary. After this literary debut, the sisters moved to New York City, where they became central figures in the East Coast literary milieu, contributed regularly to national periodicals, and hosted a famous salon on Sunday evenings. They were also active in the early days of the women\u2019s rights movement, with Phoebe Cary serving as an assistant editor for Susan B. Anthony\u2019s newspaper The Revolution. Cary published two volumes of poetry, \u00a0Poems and Parodies\u00a0(1854) and\u00a0Poems of Faith, Hope and Love\u00a0(1868).\nSick with malaria and grieving her sister\u2019s recent death, Phoebe Cary died in 1871. \n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Victorian"]}}
