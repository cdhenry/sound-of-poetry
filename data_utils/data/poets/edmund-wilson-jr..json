He worked as managing editor of Vanity Fair, associate editor of the New Republic, and book reviewer for the New Yorker. L.E. Sissman called him \u201cthe greatest of our critics of this century, and among the three or four greatest\u2014along with T.S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, and F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2014of our literary men.\u201d Wilson, according to T.S. Matthews, was \u201cthe foremost American man of letters of the twentieth century.\u201d Norman Podhoretz judged Wilson as \u201cone of the greatest men of letters this country has ever produced.\u201d\nWilson\u2019s influence upon American literature was substantial. Warner Berthoff said that \u201cfor nearly every important development in contemporary writing Edmund Wilson was in some way a spokesman\u2014an arbiter of taste, a supplier of perspective, at the least (to adapt his own phrase for Hemingway) a gauge of intellectual morale.\u201d Leonard Kriegel described Wilson\u2019s writing as \u201cone of the standards of sanity in this culture.\u201d Despite misgivings about some of Wilson\u2019s strongly held opinions, Berthoff believed that \u201call who have to do with literature have played parasite to his writings, his discoveries and revaluations, and are too much in his debt to allow much complaining. He has been one of his time\u2019s indispensable teachers and transmitters of important news.\u201d\nOne of Wilson\u2019s most important contributions was his role in giving an international perspective to American literature. Speaking of this, Sissman praised Wilson for his \u201cdestruction of the literary isolationism of this continent.\u201d \u201cNo man,\u201d Anthony Burgess wrote, \u201chas had a profounder influence on the capacity of a couple of generations (including my own) to form its own judgements on a very large and important sector of European literature.\u201d A Times Literary Supplement reviewer cited Wilson\u2019s \u201cincontestably important task\u201d as \u201cexplaining the world to America and explaining America to itself.\u201d\nAxel\u2019s Castle (1931), Wilson\u2019s first book of literary criticism, established his reputation as a critic and still stands as one of his most important works. Sherman Paul explained that the book, a study of the Symbolist literary movement, \u201cestablished the writers of the avant garde in the consciousness of the general reader: not only did it place them in a significant historical development, it taught the uninitiated how to read them.\u201d Pointing out the book\u2019s lasting value, Taylor stated that \u201cit is that rare work that can never really be dated or superseded.\u201d Kriegel agreed, writing that \u201cthe book remains one of the truly seminal works of literary criticism published in our century.\u201d\nWilson\u2019s strongly held opinions were expressed in a manner that drew respect from even those readers who did not agree with him. When reading Wilson, Burgess claimed, one was \u201cenlightened with conclusions that, so well are they stated and so logically arrived at, appear inevitable and hence obvious.\u201d George H. Douglas believed that \u201ceven when we find [Wilson\u2019s] ideas eccentric, perverse, and opinionated, as at times all of his readers must, we cannot but admire his ability to think through all of his problems for himself, his ceaseless endeavor to understand the world that confronts him and bring some order to it.\u201d Alfred Kazin wrote that Wilson \u201cfascinates even when he is wrong.\u201d Joseph Epstein observed that \u201cthe stamp of Wilson\u2019s personality was on every sentence he wrote, yet nothing he wrote could by any stretch of the imagination be called \u2018personable\u2019.\u201d Nevertheless, he admired Wilson as \u201ca living embodiment of the belief in literature \u2026 as a guide to life, and a weapon \u2026 with which to bring some sort of order to an otherwise possibly quite senseless world.\u201d\nWilson\u2019s concern with literary values was reflected in his concern for political values as well. \u201cHe always retained his strong faith in our American democratic traditions,\u201d Douglas wrote, \u201ceven though he found the original dream of the founding fathers foundering in a sea of commercial ethics and impersonal, insensate government.\u201d After a brief interest in socialism, culminating in To the Finland Station (1940), a study of the subject, Wilson grew disillusioned with politics. His writings after World War II ignored the contemporary scene. \u201cHaving lived through two World Wars in which he did not believe,\u201d Robert Emmet Long wrote, \u201c[Wilson could] no longer believe in the power of rationality to create a humane and meaningful world.\u201d Despite his disillusionment with politics, Wilson protested the Cold War of the 1950s by not paying his income taxes for nine years on the grounds that the money was used to purchase nuclear and bacteriological weapons.\n\u201cSome years before he died,\u201d Luckett stated, \u201c[Wilson] attempted an assessment of his own contribution to modern literature, and seemed content to stand on his achievements as an interpreter, explaining the characteristics of the literatures of other nations to readers in the United States. This was absurdly modest.\u201d Matthews believed that Wilson\u2019s \u201cplace in the hall of literary immortals is secure.\u201d Douglas summed up Wilson\u2019s career: \u201cHe was not only an imaginative writer of the first rank but a great democratic idealist, and a spokesman for liberal learning in the best sense. And the combination of these virtues produced for us a remarkable body of works which is sure to remain one of the great contributions to American literature of the 20th century.\u201d\nWilson died in Talcottville, New York on June 12, 1972. His substantive contribution has continued even after his death, in the form of the many volumes of his writings that have been published in the ensuing decades. Among these are Wilson\u2019s journals from the 1930s to 1960s. According to Lewis M. Dabney, editor of the final volume in the series, \u201cthe strength of Wilson\u2019s criticism and histories is his mastery of concrete details, and the journals illustrate his ability to catch the essence of a time and situation.\u201d Julian Symons argued in the Times Literary Supplement, \u201cThe primary impression left by any of these volumes covering the decades is of admiration for the power of Wilson\u2019s mind, and astonishment at the variety of his interests and the voracious curiosity with which he informs himself about them.\u201d\nAmong the other notable posthumous publications of Wilson\u2019s writings, in the opinion of David Castronovo, was Letters on Literature and Politics 1912\u20131972 (1977). In an essay for the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Castronovo wrote that \u201cthis collection shows the range of Wilson\u2019s informal interests as well as a partial record of his varied and often hectic life. Many of the letters also reveal him in the role of friend and encourager\u2014a guider and nurturer of talent and relentless battler with circumstances, both personal and social, that keep writers from working.\u201d\nThe Portable Edmund Wilson (1983), also edited by Lewis Dabney, gathered work that was representative of Wilson\u2019s remarkable career. Of its selections, Saul Goodwin proposed in the National Review \u201cthat Wilson, himself a pretty fair anthologist, would have been satisfied with the results.\u201d R.W.B. Lewis, disappointed by the absence of representative fiction and poetry in the collection, nevertheless remarked in the New York Times Book Review that the anthology does reveal Wilson in the role of \u201ccritic of history.\u201d Lewis added, \u201cTo suggest the extraordinary reach of the man, one need only list the most powerful and comprehensive essays in [The Portable Edmund Wilson,] those on Marx and Engels, Dickens, the Supreme Court\u2019s Oliver Wendell Holmes, and the Philoctetes myth.\u201d Gross expressed similar sentiments. \u201cWithin the limits of portability,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit is everything that could reasonably be asked for, and even readers who know Wilson\u2019s work well will find that they come away from it with a renewed sense of his many-sidedness and his prodigious gifts.\u201d Christopher Hawtree asserted in Spectator, \u201cA hod or a trolley would be necessary for the amount of Edmund Wilson\u2019s writing one would wish to be in print.\u201d\nMore of Wilson\u2019s magazine essays and articles were brought together in book form in 1995 by Castronovo and Janet Groth in From the Uncollected Edmund Wilson. The 50 pieces in this collection, arranged chronologically, cover nearly 50 years, range over the course of Wilson\u2019s life from his student days prior to World War I up to 1959. Included are many of the articles and essays Wilson wrote for the New Yorker in the 1940s and 1950s. \u201cThe selections,\u201d according to a reviewer for Publishers Weekly, \u201cshow Wilson\u2019s scholarship, the maturation of his keen, expressive voice and the emergence of his humanistic concerns. \u2026 A feast for Wilson devotees.\u201d\nIn addition to his literary criticism, social commentary, and journalistic writings, Wilson also penned novels, stories, poems, and plays. His first novel, I Thought of Daisy (1929), is set in the 1920s in Greenwich Village in New York City. Described by a critic for Kirkus Reviews as \u201ca tale of love, art, and politics,\u201d I Thought of Daisy is a realistic narrative that relates the story of a young man who abandons bohemian life after he meets and falls in love with a chorus girl whom he sees as an American ideal. Picturesque characters abound in the portrait Wilson paints of the era, including several based on real-life prototypes and friends such as John Dos Passos and Edna St. Vincent Millay.\u00a0Wilson initially saw the novel as his own emulation of writers such as James Joyce and Marcel Proust. However, the Kirkus Reviews critic noted \u201chis episodic tale is more in the American grain.\u201d In a 1950s edition of the novel, Wilson added a preface that criticized his own work and described the book as flawed. The Kirkus Reviews critic concluded, \u201cHe was too hard on himself\u2014the book stands up to time.\u201d\nIn the early 1940s Wilson worked on a novel that remained unfinished. Covering a period of two years in the late 1920s and dealing with the end of the Jazz Age and the beginning of the Great Depression brought on by the stock market crash of 1929, the unfinished manuscript, edited by Neale Reinitz, was published in 1998 as The Higher Jazz (Reinitz\u2019s title). Yale-educated Fritz Dietrich, a young businessman and would-be composer, is the protagonist of the book. Fritz\u2019s aim is to create a classical composition that incorporates the essence of American popular music. As in I Thought of Daisy, a number of characters in The Higher Jazz are thinly disguised fictions of prominent literary figures of the era, including Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker, and F. Scott\u00a0and Zelda Fitzgerald. In his review of The Higher Jazz for the New York Times Book Review, David Walton commented that \u201cthere are too many characters in the novel, and not much plot for them to be essential to.\u201d Walton also noted that the novel had \u201ca lot of clever dialogue\u2014all of it mildly engaging, but never very captivating.\u201d Walton felt that Reinitz\u2019s commentaries, which connected events and characters in The Higher Jazz to Wilson\u2019s life, were \u201cthe chief interest of the book.\u201d Expressing a different opinion was a writer for Kirkus Reviews, who noted the book\u2019s \u201chaunting set pieces that depict Fritz\u2019s uneasy circulation among Manhattan\u2019s nightclubs, burlesque shows, and florid artistic circles,\u201d and went on to praise Wilson\u2019s \u201cconsiderable skill as a novelist.\u201d In a like vein, a reviewer for Publishers Weekly remarked, \u201cWith an eye and ear for fashion and upper-class folly that may remind admirers of Tom Wolfe, Wilson treats us to a bird\u2019s eye view of the \u2018whole night club racket, the Hudson Valley gentry and the Algonquin Table regulars.\u201d\nSpeaking of Wilson\u2019s standing in literature at the start of the 21st century, Castronovo commented, \u201cWilson\u2019s name still stands for tireless dedication to literature, relentless pursuit of libertarian and progressive ideas, and yearning to transcend the limits of class, critical category, and fashion. His reputation, as well as threats to it, rests on his identity as a professor without a university, a critic without a field, a historian without a period, a thinker without a school.\u201d In his review of Jeffrey Meyers\u2019s Edmund Wilson: A Biography for Commentary, John Gross stated, \u201cThe literary Wilson will live. The longer the shadows cast over the field of literary studies by today\u2019s deconstructionists and ideologues, the brighter his achievement will shine.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
