O\u2019Brien was educated at Harvard University and the University of Iowa. He is the author of several poetry collections, including People on Sunday (2013), Metropole (2011), Green and Gray (2007), and The Guns and Flags Project (2002). His work is part of Three Poets: Ashbery, Donnelly, O\u2019Brien (2012), and he collaborated with poet Jeff Clark on 2A (2006).  \u00a0 O\u2019Brien explores the structural possibilities of public space and speech, investigating the threshold between observer and observed. In an interview with Danniel Schoonebeek for The American Reader, O\u2019Brien stated, \u201cI think of poetry as something other than entertainment because it makes conceptual and nonconceptual demands, makes its consumer a maker, and promises that speech between strangers isn\u2019t over or fixed.\u201d  \u00a0 O\u2019Brien has taught at the University of California-Berkeley and for San Quentin State Prison\u2019s Prison University Project. He lives in California.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
