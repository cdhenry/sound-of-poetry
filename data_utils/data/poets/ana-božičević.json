Her first book-length collection,\u00a0Stars of the Night Commute\u00a0(2009), was Lambda Literary Award finalist, and her second book, Rise in the Fall\u00a0(2013) won a Lambda Literary Award. Of her third book,\u00a0Joy of Missing Out\u00a0(2017), Publishers Weekly writes: \u201cPoet and translator Bo\u017ei\u010devi\u0107 follows\u00a0Rise in the Fall\u00a0with another plaudit-worthy collection that is even more humorous, complex, and responsive to the world. Bo\u017ei\u010devi\u0107 easily harnesses her position as a poet of quiet social revolt, writing in a contemplative voice that questions contemporary powers: the government, the police, the Internet.\u201d\n\r\nShe received a \u201c40 Under 40: The Future of Feminism\u201d award from Feminist Press and a PEN American Center/NYSCA grant for translating\u00a0Zvonko Karanovi\u0107's It Was Easy to Set the Snow on Fire (Phoneme Media, 2017).\u00a0\n\r\nBo\u017ei\u010devi\u0107 has worked for the PEN American Center, the Center for the Humanities of the Graduate Center, CUNY, and the Bruce High Quality Foundation.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Eastern Europe"]}}
