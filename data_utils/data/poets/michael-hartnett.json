Though he grew up in poverty\u2014at times under the care of his Irish-speaking grandmother\u2014Hartnett attended University College Dublin for a year on a scholarship and was writing poetry by the early 1960s.\u00a0  \u00a0 Hartnett wrote poetry in English and Irish; his early collections include Anatomy of a Clich\u00e9 (1968) and Farewell to English (1975). The latter announced his intention to write in Irish and led to the collections Adharca Broic (1978), Do Nuala: Foighne Chrainn (1984), and An Phurg\u00f3id (1989). He followed these with the English Inchicore Haiku (1985), A Necklace of Wrens (1987), Poems to a Younger Woman (1989), and The Killing of Dreams (1992). His Collected Poems appeared in two volumes in 1984 and 1987; Wake Forest University Press published his Selected & New Poems in 1994.  \u00a0 In addition to exploring the tensions between the two languages, Hartnett\u2019s poetry shows a profound sense of the Irish landscape, a troubled relationship with Yeats\u2019s Anglo-Irish influence, and careful treatment of the history of Ireland and England. Joan Trodden Keefe, reviewing Collected Poems, Vol. 1 in World Literature Today, wrote of his \u201ctechnical virtuosity and spiritual daring.\u201d She observed: \u201cThroughout the poems there is, not unexpectedly, a highly strung tension between a romantic ideal and the real world.\u201d \u00a0 Hartnett translated poetry from the Irish, including Selected Poems of D\u00e1ith\u00ed \u00d3Bruadair (1985) and The Poems of Aodhagh\u00e1n \u00d3Rathaille (1999). He also translated Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca\u2019s Gypsy Ballads: A Version of the Romancero Gitano of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca (1973) and the collection Tao: A Version of the Chinese Classic of the Sixth Century (1971). \u00a0 Hartnett won the American Ireland Literary Fund Award in 1975, 1980, and 1990, and the Irish American Cultural Institute Award in 1988. He lived in London, Dublin, Madrid, and Limerick. The \u00c9igse Michael Hartnett, a poetry festival established in 2000, is held annually in Newcastle West, County Limerick, in his honor.\u00a0 \u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Ireland & Northern Ireland"]}}
