In the Los Angeles Times, David Ulin observed that Larkin\u2019s poems \u201cstake out a territory of relentless self-examination, taking on love and death, family and sexuality in a voice that is unsentimental, ruthless and clear-eyed \u2026\u00a0This is poetry without pity, in which despair leads not to degradation but to a kind of grace.\u201d\nLarkin is the author of several collections of poetry, including Blue Hanuman (2014); My Body: New and Selected Poems (2007), winner of the Audre Lorde Award from Publishing Triangle; Lambda Literary Award winner Cold River (1997); and Housework (1975).
