She was born in Winslade, Devon, and though she had limited formal education, she was an avid reader of theology, science, and philosophy. In 1701, she published The Ladies Defense, a long poem in response to John Sprint\u2019s The Bride-Woman\u2019s Counsellor, a marriage sermon he delivered in 1699. Her frequently anthologized poem \u201cTo the Ladies\u201d appeared in Poems on Several Occasions (1703); it echoes the feminist argument she set forth in The Female Advocate; or, A Plea for the Just Liberty of the Tender Sex and Particularly of Married Women (1700). In 1710, she published Essays upon Several Subjects. That same year, she died on December 15, and she is buried in the church of St. John the Baptist, Higher Ashton, Devon. The Poems and Prose of Mary, Lady Chudleigh, edited by Margaret J.M. Ezell, was published by Oxford University Press in 1993.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
