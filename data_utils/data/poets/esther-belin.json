She is a graduate of the Institute of American Indian Arts and the University of California, Berkeley. Her first book of poetry, From the Belly of My Beauty (1999), won the American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation. She is also the author of the collection\u00a0Of Cartography (2017).\nBelin\u2019s parents were relocated from the Southwest in the 1950s as part of the federal Indian relocation policy, and her work reflects the experience of a Native American living in urban Los Angeles. She often addresses the attempts to assimilate Native Americans into mainstream American culture, as well as larger themes of racism, alienation, and substance abuse.\nIn a 2000 interview for SAIL (Studies in American Indian Literatures), Belin stressed the connection between writing and the oral tradition. She elaborated: \u201cI see myself as an interpreter of what happened in my parents\u2019 generation, and I want to let people know about their experiences, especially with boarding schools and relocation. I see my books as an anthropological text\u2014telling what it\u2019s like for Native people.\u201d\nBelin lives in Durango, Colorado\u00a0with her husband and children.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
