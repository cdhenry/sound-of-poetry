His first collection of poetry is From the Author\u2019s Private Collection (2015); his chapbooks include From the Author\u2019s Private Collection (2013) and Legal Pure (2012). Amling\u2019s poetry draws on pop culture, references to leisure and luxury lifestyles, and a formal method that often mimics collage, a medium Amling works in as a visual artist as well. Publisher\u2019s Weekly described the poems in From the Author\u2019s Private Collection as \u201csocial critique delivered through a signal scrambler.\u201d\nAmling has exhibited work at Bushel Collective, Essex Flowers, City Bird Gallery, and many other spaces. His collages and installations playfully evoke \u201cleisure environments\u201d through allusion to, and distortion of, retro lifestyle magazines and vernacular luxury items. In an interview about his solo exhibit at Flying Object in Hadley, Massachusetts, \u201cPrivate Event,\u201d Amling noted, \u201cIt\u2019s really the space around the subject being photographed that I\u2019m after. A blurry lamp. Sunny wallpaper. I think with these soft tones and elements combined in a collage you get an undercurrent of seduction.\u201d Another solo exhibition, \u201cLife Coach,\u201d was installed at Berl\u2019s Poetry Bookshop. Amling is editor of the small press After Hours Ltd.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
