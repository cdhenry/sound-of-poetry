His visual and concrete poems\u00a0often use\u00a0unconventional typography and spacing and engage\u00a0with not just visual innovation but also musical or sound-based experimentation, as can be heard in his jazz poetry recordings. In a 2004 essay for Jacket2, Charles Bernstein states, \u201cThe Matrix is a strikingly designed volume, composed of 71 poems in three parts, mostly visual or \u2018concrete\u2019 poems, which are at the same time \u2018sound\u2019\u00a0poems. \u2026 Pritchard hops, skips, and jumps with his syncopated words, creating spaces inside words in a way that makes one word many. It\u2019s a rhythmic concatenation that relies on multiplicity and ambiguity.\u201d Zachary Schomburg, in a 2007 essay on Pritchard\u2019s work for Octopus Magazine, observes, \u201cNot unlike the avant-garde jazz of the 1950\u2019s or jazz fusion, Pritchard\u2019s [poetry] doesn\u2019t approach meaning through narrative or melody, but through vibrations: vibrations of life, black life, urban life, jazz culture, pre-hip-hop, vibrations of what was more directly encountered in the literature of the Black Arts Movement.\u201d\nPritchard published two collections of poetry: Eecchhooeess (1971)\u00a0and\u00a0The Matrix, Poems: 1960\u20131970. His work was also featured in the journals Umbra and The East Village Other. Pritchard performed his work on the jazz poetry compilation New Jazz Poets (1967), and his poetry was anthologized in The New Black Poetry (1969) and In a Time of Revolution: Poems from Our Third World (1969). Critical discussions of his work and legacy can be found in A.L. Nielsen\u2019s Black Chant: Languages of African-American Postmodernism (1997) and in Dark Horses: Poets on Lost Poems (2004).\nPritchard taught poetry at the New School for Social Research and was a poet-in-residence at Friends Seminary. He died in eastern Pennsylvania on February 8, 1996.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
