Raised in the United States and the Netherlands, she was educated at the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies in London. Valles has also published poetry under the name Alissa Leigh.  \u00a0 In her concise yet sweeping poems, Valles seeks an elemental level of unity, bending self, place, and history into clear-eyed inquiry. In a 2009 interview with Claire McQuerry for the Four Way Books blog, Valles stated, \u201cStudying languages certainly contributes to a sense of the boundaries of language, but it also forces you to think or dream about a possible underlying unity, some kind of deep grammar, built into the mind. I for one am very susceptible to metaphors drawn from the Chomskian theory (or myth). At the same time, language is so bound up with \u2018who we are\u2019 that it makes a good framework for exploring the ambiguities of selfhood.\u201d In a starred Publishers Weekly review of Orphan Fire, the reviewer praised the \u201cterse, learned, harsh collection,\u201d noting that \u201cValles adapts almost equally well to very long lines and to short ones, to Continental and to American scenes. \u2026 When she takes a longer view, adapting ancient myths or ancient authors, her lapidary talents are almost unequaled.\u201d \u00a0 Her debut poetry collection is Orphan Fire (2008). Valles is the editor and co-translator of Zbigniew Herbert\u2019s Collected Poems 1956\u20131998 (2008) as well as Herbert\u2019s The Collected Prose 1948\u20131998 (2010). She has contributed to Polish Writers on Writing (2007, edited by Adam Zagajewski) and the New European Poets (2008, edited by Wayne Miller and Kevin Prufer). A recipient of the Poetry Magazine Ruth Lilly Poetry Fellowship and the Bess Hokin Prize, Valles has worked for the BBC, the Dutch Institute of War Documentation, the Jewish Historical Institute, and Warsaw\u2019s La Strada International and has served as an editor for the online literary journal Words Without Borders. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
