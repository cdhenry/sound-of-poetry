First published at the precocious age of 17, Ewart had a poetry book, Poems and Songs\u00a0(1939), to his credit by the time he was 23. Ewart was influenced early on by T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and Ronald Bottrall, and later by W.H. Auden, and he studied at Cambridge University in the mid-1930s. But just as he was establishing his own poetic voice, Ewart found his writing interrupted by the outbreak of war: \u201cI found it very hard to write during World War II, when I was on active service in North Africa and Italy.\u201d And when the war was over, he pursued a different path, becoming first an assistant in the book review department of the British Council and then an advertising copywriter for 18 years. He did not pursue his old vocation until, as he wrote, \u201cAlan Ross, editor of London Magazine, encouraged me to begin writing poetry again in 1959.\u201d\nAndrew Motion commented in the New Statesman that \u201cEwart dried up during the war for the same reason that he has written so well since: because of his indebtedness to the senior Thirties poets. ... The process [of finding his own voice] didn\u2019t involve discarding his original allegiances altogether, but injecting into Auden\u2019s more discursive style a worldliness reminiscent of MacNeice.\u201d Following what the Times Literary Supplement described as his \u201cremarkable poetic rebirth in the early 1960s,\u201d Ewart produced an uninterrupted stream of light-hearted verse that was known for its irreverence, sexual content, and effortless technical skill.\nAn acknowledged master of forms who could mimic almost any style of writing, Ewart had depth as well as breadth, as a Times Literary Supplement reviewer explained: \u201cWhat makes him different is that he isn\u2019t content with satirical pastiche or parody. He has a strong, gamey talent of his own, much concerned with the disputed territory that lies between things-as-they-are, things-as-they-might-be, and things-as-people- say-they-are.\u201d For instance, in \u201cThe Gentle Sex,\u201d which recounts how a group of Ulster Defence Association women beat a political opponent to death in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Ewart employed a metric form that Gerard Manley Hopkins used. Thwaite, asked, \u201con the face of it what could be less apt than to tell this bleak story in the stanza form of \u2018The Wreck of the Deutschland\u2019?\u00a0But this is very precisely what Ewart does; and in the process one feels the ghostly presence of Hopkins\u2019s nuns behind the brutally vicious tale.\u201d\nWhile Ewart\u2019s subtle literary allusions might be lost on unknowing readers, there was no mistaking his preoccupation with sex, which frequently served as a springboard for larger concerns. \u201cStarting off from sex, often in one of its unhappier forms, Ewart comments on ambition, middle age, life in the suburbs, the boredom of wives, office politics, children, history, etc.,\u201d remarked Peter Porter in London Magazine. One of Ewart\u2019s earliest successes was a takeoff on the Lewis Carroll classic, irreverently titled \u201cPhallus in Wonderland,\u201d and he seemed to become even less inhibited with advancing age. In the opening poem of his later Pleasures of the Flesh\u00a0(1966),\u00a0for instance, Ewart embraced his lust joyfully: \u201cA small talent, like a small penis, / Should not be hidden lightly under a bushel, / But shine in use, or exhibitionism. / Otherwise how should one know it was there?\u201d\nWith the appearance of Pleasures of the Flesh\u00a0\u201cit becomes clear how perfectly Ewart\u2019s creative life has conformed to the butterfly system,\u201d noted Times Literary Supplement contributor Russell Davies. \u201cAn active and noticeable caterpillar in youth, and twenty years a chrysalis, he struggles out stickily in Londoners and bursts forth, at last, into a gaudy maturity with Pleasures.\u201d In his review, Porter expressed a similar view: \u201cPleasures of the Flesh establishes Ewart as an important poet ... with something to say to us directly. The gestation which followed that early promise was a long one, but the results have been worth waiting for.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the few bright features about poetry in the late 1970s is that Gavin Ewart is growing old disgracefully,\u201d wrote Anthony Thwaite in a 1978 Times Literary Supplement review. \u201cHe grows more prolific, wider-ranging, funnier, and more scabrous as the years go by.\u201d The books of light verse Ewart published in the 1980s\u2014and their increasing acceptance as legitimate poetry\u2014confirmed Thwaite\u2019s observation. Reviewers found the flowering of this British satirist all the more remarkable because his poetic voice was silent for 25 years.\nDavies believed that after the early 1970s Ewart had become \u201cthe star of his own production. The very title of The Gavin Ewart Show proclaims it. In a curious way, he has become the sort of poet whom one \u2018follows,\u2019 as one might an actor or a sportsman or a singer. Ewart never produces a tight, interlocking performance at book length, but nor do singers with the \u2018albums\u2019; yet there are always one or two songs you play over and over. To have established this kind of career at all is a very considerable achievement.\u201d When reading The Gavin Ewart Show: Selected Poems, 1939-1985, David Howarth suggested in his Phoenix review that rather than approaching the volume academically, it\u2019s \u201cmuch better to take Ewart\u2019s advice: \u2018Slup me rough and homely and I\u2019ll taste fine.\u2019\u201d\nThe Collected Ewart, 1933-1980 moved literary critic Terry Eagleton to write in Stand, \u201cLike all fine comedians, [Ewart] combines an eye for the contingent outlawed by tragic ideologies with a democratic impulse equally alien to them, a shrewd sense of what rhyme, inversion or antithesis will release the most pleasurably disturbing tensions in as many readers as possible, in the collective unconscious which unites his audience beneath their social or cultural differences.\u201d Alan Brownjohn remarked in Encounter of the Ewart represented in this collection, \u201cA point often forgotten ... is that under the often exuberantly Rabelaisian surfaces, or between the elaborate jokes, there is a committed seriousness.\u201d\nCatherine Peters, reviewing The New Ewart: Poems, 1980-1982 in the Spectator, indicated that the poet had lost none of his skill in forms over the years. \u201cThe first thing one notices about Ewart,\u201d she wrote, \u201cis his stunning technical virtuosity; he seems to be at home in every verse form from ballad to sestina to elegiac ode.\u201d Peters recommended this collection as a good starting point \u201cfor those who haven\u2019t had the good fortune to come across [Ewart] before.\u201d Lincoln Kirsten, too, praised Ewart for his versatility and technique, and stated in the New York Review of Books: \u201cIt is not possible to demonstrate the acrobatics of his versifying spectrum with every advantage and complexity of form from Horace through the troubadours to Lallan Scots and today\u2019s Liverpudlian. He does not disdain doggerel where it wags well.\u201d\nPenultimate Poems\u00a0(1989), true to the earlier Ewart, provides \u201cplenty of good filthy fun,\u201d declared Times reviewer Robert Nye, who dubbed Ewart a \u201cpast master of the craft of being light-hearted without suffocating in his own silliness.\u201d Considering the scope of Ewart\u2019s work in a review of the later Collected Poems 1980-1990, Nye wrote that after the author\u2019s long silence, the \u201clast twenty-five years ... have seen this poet getting it all together again in no uncertain fashion. ... Witty, clever, coarse, he needed the last couple of decades, with their ghastly blurring of those categories, to permit him his own late flowering as a poet. ... And I\u2019m not knocking Ewart.\u201d\nBritish poet Peter Reading tackled the question of Ewart\u2019s acceptance head-on: \u201cProbably some critics and readers devalue the more serious side of this writer because of his readiness to espouse the light, the funny, and the trivial. He is \u2018popular,\u2019 as poets go; but it should be asked whether his audience has a slightly patronizing attitude, as to a sort of literary jester. ... Philip Larkin, writing in Quarto of The New Ewart, gave it as his opinion that \u2018The most remarkable phenomenon of the English poetic scene during the last ten years has been the advent, or perhaps I should say the irruption of, Gavin Ewart.\u2019\u201d This view was supported by John Whitworth\u2019s suggestion in the Spectator: \u201cWhen we are all dead will a clutch of Ewart make the school anthologies? If they still teach poetry (well, they might), I shouldn\u2019t be at all surprised.\u201d\nEwart died in London on October 23, 1995.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
