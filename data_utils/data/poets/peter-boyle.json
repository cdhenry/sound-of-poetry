He started writing poetry in his teens, in part, he has said in interviews, as a way to grapple with the effects of childhood polio. He earned an honours degree in English from Sydney University, a Diploma of Education, and an MA in Spanish and Latin American Studies. He is the author of the poetry collections Coming home from the world (1994), The Blue Cloud of Crying (1997), What the painter saw in our faces (2001), Museum of Space (2004), and The Apocrypha of William O\u2019Shaunessy (2009).\n\u00a0\nBoyle has translated French and Spanish poets, including Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, C\u00e9sar Vallejo, and Pierre Reverdy. Selected translations include Eugenio Montejo\u2019s The Trees: Selected Poems 1967\u20132004 (2004) and Chilean poet Juan Garrido-Salgado\u2019s Unmoving Navigator, who fell in love with the ocean\u2019s darkness / Navagante imm\u00f3vil, que am\u00f3 en la oscuridad del oc\u00e9ano (2006). Boyle\u2019s translations have also appeared in the journals Jubilat and American Poetry Review.\n\u00a0\nBoyle\u2019s own work contemplates language and history. The Apocrypha of William O\u2019Shaunessy, an inventive amalgamation of poetry, prose, and \u201cfictive translations from imaginary texts,\u201d is concerned with everything from politics to philology, imagined lands and languages to books and history. In an interview with Mascara Review, Boyle described the book\u2019s form: \u201cIt is as much in prose poetry as in free verse form. Its fundamental concern is not narrating a story where the fate of the characters is the reader\u2019s chief interest, though there are quite a few characters in the book.\u2026 I think it is a form of its own.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBoyle\u2019s awards include a New South Wales Premier\u2019s Literary Award, a National Book Council Banjo Award, and a South Australian Festival Award for Poetry.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Australia"]}}
