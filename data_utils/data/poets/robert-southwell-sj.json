His brief literary career flourished during the years when he was an underground Jesuit priest in Protestant England. It is agreed that Southwell brought with him from Italy the themes and the aesthetics of militant Counter-Reformation piety, although there is disagreement over the terms used to describe the resulting style: baroque, mannerist, metaphysical, meditative, Petrarchan, and contemplative are among the adjectives proposed. There is also disagreement over Southwell\u2019s literary achievement and the extent and significance of his influence. What cannot be doubted is his extraordinary popularity during his brief English career and the 40 years following it. Contemporary writers seem to have been impressed by his clear, precise English, by the beauty of its rhythms, and by Southwell\u2019s gift for combining passion with moral and intellectual analysis. There is a strong case to be made for his influence on his contemporaries, among them Thomas Nashe, Thomas Lodge, and William Shakespeare.\n\r\nRobert Southwell was born around 1561 at Horsham St. Faith, Norfolk, the youngest son and fifth child in a family of eight. The Southwells, a county family that had prospered from the dissolution of the monasteries, formed part of a network of wealthy, interrelated families that included the Wriothsleys, Howards, Bacons, and Cecils as well as recusants such as Vaux, Arden, and Copley. Southwell was a studious boy whose father liked to call him \u201cFather Robert.\u201d In 1576 he, like many other boys of his class, was sent overseas to be educated in the Jesuit school at Douai. He would not see England again for ten years. Between the ages of 15 and 17 he became convinced of his vocation to a religious life, and in 1578 he was admitted to the noviceship at Rome, where he embarked upon his formation as a Jesuit. In 1581 he transferred from the Roman to the English College, where he became tutor and prefect of studies. He was ordained in 1584 and was sent on the English mission in 1586, landing secretly with his fellow Jesuit Henry Garnet somewhere between Dover and Folkestone in early July. He was about 25 years old.\n\r\nChristopher Devlin estimated a Catholic priest\u2019s chance of survival in England in 1586 as one in three. Southwell led the active but disguised and secret life of a pastor for six years, working mostly in and around London except for some journeys into the Midlands. For much of this period he lived under the protection of Anne, countess of Arundel, whose husband, the earl, was a prisoner in the Tower of London. In June 1592 the notorious priest hunter Richard Topcliffe succeeded in capturing Southwell. Topcliffe, Elizabeth I\u2019s servant and favorite, \u201can atrocious psychopath,\u201d in Geoffrey Hill\u2019s words, was allowed to torture prisoners in his own house. Southwell was in this man\u2019s hands and then in the hands of Privy Council interrogators and torturers for a month; news of his transfer to solitary confinement in the Tower was a relief to his friends.\n\r\nAfter more than two years\u2019 imprisonment he was moved to the notorious cell in Newgate called Limbo, and his trial took place on February 20, 1595 under the statute of 1585, which had made it treason to be a Catholic priest and administer the sacraments in England. He was found guilty and was executed the next day by hanging, drawing, and quartering. At his trial Southwell said that he had been tortured ten times and would rather have endured ten executions. Pierre Janelle, who quotes the records in detail, writes that Southwell made of his trial and execution \u201ca work of art of supreme beauty.\u201d He was 33 at his death. Pope Paul VI canonized him on October 25, 1970 as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales.\n\r\nSouthwell wrote most of his English works between the time of his return to England in 1586 and his capture in 1592. As a prisoner he had no access to writing materials. Janelle described his literary career as an \u201capostolate of letters\u201d and thought that his superiors had instructed him to make writing a part of his missionary activity. This theory was perhaps based on the fact that Southwell and Garnet carried in their instructions permission to print \u201csome small books for the defense of the faith and the edification of Catholics.\u201d Other critics have treated Southwell\u2019s work as versified doctrine, as religious propaganda, as a substitute for preaching, or as the outcome of his Jesuit training in religious faith and discipline by means of the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. Southwell states in the prefatory material to Mary Magdalen\u2019s Funeral Tears (1591) and to Saint Peter\u2019s Complaint (1595) that he wished to set an example of writing on religious themes in English, but nowhere does he say how or why he began to write.\n\r\nHis earliest works, dating from his Roman years, are Latin poems preserved at Stonyhurst. Brian Oxley has shown that these youthful poems share the mature Southwell\u2019s habits of thought as well as the verbal artistry found in his English work: \u201cSouthwell\u2019s sense of the artifice of holy things, and indeed, of the holiness of artifice, is central to his life and work.\u201d The Latin poems are evidence of a strong, probably irresistible vocation as a writer and poet.\n\r\nSouthwell\u2019s first full-length English work was the prose An Epistle of Comfort (1587), which originated as a series of pastoral letters written to his hostess\u2019s husband, the earl of Arundel, imprisoned in the Tower for his religion. Southwell published the book on a secret press supplied by the help of the countess\u2014although it is unlikely that the press was actually in Arundel House, as some authorities suggest. Helen C. White has shown that the Epistle of Comfort\u2014a letter written to encourage the persecuted, even to the point of martyrdom\u2014is an example of an ancient Christian genre. It has 16 chapters, the first 11 devoted to the various sources of comfort for the afflicted Catholics.\n\r\nSouthwell begins modestly and generally, pointing out that suffering is a sign that his readers are out of the devil\u2019s power, loved by God, and imitators of Christ. Suffering, he argues, is inseparable from human life and in most cases is no more than the sufferer deserves. Then, at midpoint, he turns to the peculiar situation of the recusants, beginning with the argument that there is comfort in suffering for the Catholic faith. He then presents a series of all-too-real possibilities, starting with general persecution and ascending through imprisonment and violent death to martyrdom itself. The concluding chapters deal with the unhappiness of the lapsed, the impossibility of martyrdom for the heretic, the glory that awaits the martyr, and, lastly, a warning to the persecutors. The content and the style are much influenced by the patristic authors whom Southwell quotes so deftly; the tone is measured, unyielding, even triumphant. In Southwell\u2019s mind, the Catholics\u2019 suffering is a direct consequence of the Protestant heresy, and that in turn is a manifestation of the perennial evil of earthly life. To bear its effects is an honor: \u201cLet our adversaries therefore load us with the infamous titles of traitors, and rebels,\u201d he writes,\nas the Arians did in the persecution of the Vandals, and as the Ethnicswere wont to call Christians sarmentitios, and semasios, because they were tied to halfpenny stakes, and burnt with shrubs: so let them draw us upon hurdles, hang us, unbowel us alive, mangle us, boil us, and set our quarters upon their gates, to be meat for the birds of the air, as they use to handle rebels: we will answer them as the Christians of former persecutions have done. Hic est habitus victoriae nostrae, hec palmata vestis, tali curru triumphamus, merito itaque victis non placemus. Such is the manner of our victory, such our conquerous garment, in such chariots do we triumph. What marvel therefore if our vanquished enemies mislike us?\n\r\nThe second of Southwell\u2019s prose works to appear in print was Mary Magdalen\u2019s Funeral Tears. It had been circulating in manuscript before Gabriel Cawood published it in late 1591 with an author\u2019s preface to the reader, and it, too, was written for one of the recusant circle: Dorothy Arundel, the daughter of Sir John Arundel of Lanherne; she later became a Benedictine nun. The work originated in a popular homily, usually attributed to Origen, on Saint John\u2019s account of Mary Magdalen\u2019s encounter with Christ on Easter morning. Southwell first read this homily in Italy, presumably in Italian and Latin (an Italian version survives in manuscript at Stonyhurst, attributed to Saint Bonaventura). In the Stonyhurst holograph there are fragments of Southwell\u2019s attempts at an English translation; they show how difficult he found English composition after speaking Latin and Italian for ten years. The homily was available in England, printed in Latin around 1504 and in English translation in 1565. There are signs that Southwell knew and used this translation. Some writers suggest that he may also have known Valvasone\u2019s poem Le lagrime di S. Maria Maddalena, but no clear evidence of this influence has been presented.\n\r\nIn Southwell\u2019s hands the little homily grows to a work three times as long. It used to be thought that the book originated as a sermon, but this theory was based on ignorance of the source. Mary Magdalen\u2019s Funeral Tears is a meditation on Mary\u2019s experience, cast largely in the form of a dialogue between Mary and the other persons present, the angels in the empty tomb, Christ, and the narrator. The homily provides the outline and some of the contents, but Southwell\u2019s tone is different from that of his source, partly owing to the intensity, detail, and accomplishment of his prose but mostly to his conception of the incident as a love story. Southwell\u2019s Mary is less the repentant sinner than the lover of Christ; she weeps tears of loss, not remorse. For her, Christ is the sum of all value, and in finding the empty tomb she experiences utter loss. All Mary\u2019s thoughts and actions proceed from her love, and as Southwell presents her, she is a heroic woman.\n\r\nThere is also an allegorical tendency in the work, which Southwell found in his source but which he develops according to his own preoccupations. Allegorically speaking, Mary is the Christian soul, separated from the living Christian truth that is her only happiness; more specifically, she is an English Catholic woman, and the violence that threatens her is that of contemporary England. The book has its longeurs, but it has passages of great power, among them the remarkable apostrophe on Mary\u2019s tears:\nRepentant eyes are the cellars of angels, and penitent tears their sweetest wines, which the savor of life perfumeth, the taste of grace sweeteneth, and the purest colors of returning innocency highly beautifieth. This dew of devotion never falleth, but the sun of justice draweth it up, and upon what face soever it droppeth it maketh it amiable in God\u2019s eye.... No, no, the angels must still bathe themselves in the pure streams of thy eyes, and thy face shall still be set with this liquid pearl, that as out of thy tears were stroken the first sparks of thy Lord\u2019s love, so thy tears may be the oil, to nourish and feed his flame. Till death dam up the springs, they shall never cease running: and then shall thy soul be ferried in them to the harbor of life, that as by them it was first passed from sin to grace, so in them it may be wafted from grace to glory.\nSouthwell also develops a real narrative intensity as he works out the logic of Mary\u2019s passion. It was his best-known and most influential prose work.\n\r\nSouthwell\u2019s next major prose work was The Triumphs over Death (1595), an elegy in epistolary form on Lady Margaret Sackville, written in September 1591 and addressed to her brother, Philip Howard, earl of Arundel. The Triumphs appears in three of the manuscript copies of Southwell\u2019s poems. It was published in late 1595, doubtless from a similar manuscript, by a minor poet called John Trussell, who provided prefatory poems and a dedication to Lady Margaret\u2019s children. Trussell describes himself as the work\u2019s \u201cfoster-sire\u201d; his editorial comments present it as evidence of the quality of Southwell\u2019s mind and art and set it in the context of four lives and deaths: the subject\u2019s, the recipient\u2019s (Arundel died in August 1595), the author\u2019s, and the reader\u2019s. For its contemporary readers, therefore, The Triumphs became Southwell\u2019s last statement to death and to his own executioners, and this may be why it appears in the manuscripts with the poems. One sentence sums up its tone of absolute and exalted resignation: \u201cLet God strip you to the skin, yea to the soul, so he stay with you himself.\u201d\n\r\nSouthwell\u2019s last major prose work, written in late 1591 or early 1592, is probably the most interesting from a historical and personal point of view. An Humble Supplication (1600) is a reply to the scurrilous royal proclamation of October 1591, which, besides stigmatizing the Catholic priests as unnatural subjects, baseborn, dissolute, and criminal ruffians, stated to the world that in England Catholics were punished solely for political, not religious, reasons. The Supplication is in the form of a petition to the queen, whom it exempts from direct knowledge of her ministers\u2019 behavior. It rebuts the proclamation, point by point, and asks for mercy for the Catholic minority on grounds of equity and right. It includes an extremely interesting and well-informed explanation of the Babington Plot as a \u201csting operation\u201d practiced upon \u201cgreen wits\u201d by \u201cMaster Secretary\u2019s subtle and sifting wit,\u201d and there is a description of the atrocities suffered by Catholic prisoners in the hands of Elizabeth\u2019s legal officers that is a masterpiece of controlled indignation as well as a superb example of the power in controversy of the appeal to fact and reality:\nDivers have been thrown into unsavory and dark dungeons, and brought so near starving, that some for famine have licked the very moisture off the walls; some have so far been consumed that they were hardly recovered to life. What unsufferable agonies we have been put to upon the rack, it is not possible to express, the feeling so far exceedeth all speech. Some with instruments have been rolled up together like a ball, and so crushed that the blood sprouted out at divers parts of their bodies.\n\r\nSouthwell\u2019s minor works, A Short Rule of Good Life and the \u201cEpistle to His Father\u201d (published around 1596-7), like the rest of his writings, circulated in manuscript before publication. A Short Rule is a small handbook for the layman who wishes to live a devout life. Like all of Southwell\u2019s prose, it draws upon the long tradition of Christian literature on its subject; and its style, plain and expository, is beautifully matched to its subject and purpose. Its adaptation to lay life of principles originally developed for conventual life is particularly interesting:\nAfter prayer, on working days, I must go presently about some work or exercise that may be of some profit, and of all other things take heed of idleness, the mother of all vices. Towards eleven (if company and other more weighty causes will permit) I may meditate a little and call to mind how I have spent the morning, asking God grace to spend the afternoon better.\nSouthwell\u2019s advice on running a household, bringing up children, looking after servants, and spending time wisely places him in the company of contemporaries such as the Calvinist William Perkins. A Short Rule, like Perkins\u2019s Government of the Tongue, is a founding document of Christian social and domestic life in the modern world. It is not surprising that A Short Rule, like Robert Persons\u2019s Book of Resolution, circulated in versions edited for Protestant use.\n\r\nUnlike his prose, and with the exception of three topical poems (on Mary, Queen of Scots, on Philip Howard\u2019s condemnation, and on Lady Margaret Sackville\u2019s death), Southwell\u2019s poetry cannot be dated any more closely than within the six years of his English pastorate: 1586-1592. To judge from the dedicatory letter, \u201cThe Author to His Loving Cousin,\u201d Southwell prepared a collection of his short lyrics, but no example of this text exists. What survives are manuscript copies of a collection of 52 lyrics put together probably after Southwell\u2019s arrest by someone who was, in effect, a literary executor. One of these manuscripts includes a copy of the long poem Saint Peter\u2019s Complaint, which also exists in a copy made by a Catholic called Mowle. These manuscript copies were prepared by and circulated mostly, but not wholly, among Catholics. The poems became sufficiently well known to become a valuable literary property at the time of Southwell\u2019s death; hence the publication in 1595 of two volumes, Saint Peter\u2019s Complaint and Moeoniae, their contents undoubtedly derived from collections made by Catholic copyists but edited to remove ostentatiously Catholic material and arranged to suit the publishers.\n\r\nWhen Southwell left England in 1576, the best poetry in print was Richard Tottell\u2019s Songs and Sonnets (1557); the Mirror for Magistrates; the work of such minor figures as Barnabe Googe, Thomas Churchyard, and Arthur Golding; and the recently published work of George Gascoigne. The Paradise of Dainty Devices, which replaced Tottell\u2019s anthology in popularity, appeared in 1576. When Southwell returned in 1586, the situation was different. With Sir Philip Sidney\u2019s poetry circulating in manuscript and Edmund Spenser\u2019s The Shepheardes Calender (1579) in print, the change in poetic style from \u201cdrab\u201d to \u201cgolden\u201d (C.S. Lewis\u2019s well-known terms) was well under way; but although Southwell enjoyed limited contact with English affairs through visitors and students in Rome, it is not surprising that the strongest English influences on his poetry should be Tottell, The Paradise, and Gascoigne\u2014the sources of Southwell\u2019s English technique, syntax, stanzas, and meter.\n\r\nOn the other hand the strongest intellectual and aesthetic influences on Southwell\u2019s work are Continental and professional. Saint Peter\u2019s Complaint, written in the common six-line Tudor stanza, began as an imitation, even as a translation, of an early form of Luigi Tansillo\u2019s Le Lagrime di San Pietro, a once-popular exemplar of the literature of penitence and conversion characteristic of Counter-Reformation Italy. Mario Praz also thought that Southwell\u2019s \u201crich and gorgeous\u201d sequence of sacred epigrams on the Blessed Virgin and Christ showed the influence of contemporary Italian poetry. The \u201cprofessional\u201d influence on Southwell emerges not merely in his continual use of patristic and biblical material in his conceits, but in his conceptions themselves. Many of his most extravagant looking passages, such as the stanza of Saint Peter\u2019s Complaint beginning \u201cO Bethlehem cisterns, David\u2019s most desire,\u201d are the result of long familiarity with patristic Bible commentary. Some of the stylistic habits that earlier commentators attributed to the influence of Petrarch and John Lyly reflect Southwell\u2019s love of writers such as Saint Augustine and his favorite, Saint Bernard, whose works he asked for in the Tower. One last influence he shared with all his literate contemporaries (although, perhaps because of his priestly and academic training, its effect on his writing was unusual for the period): Southwell was a learned classicist who wrote in Latin before he wrote in English. Unlike his contemporaries, however, he did not Latinize his English; instead, he disciplined it to the standards of classical lucidity and precision.\n\r\nThe result of this blend of classical, sacred, secular, domestic, and Continental influences is a style so individual that Lewis, trying to place Southwell historically, asserts in English Literature in the Sixteenth Century, Excluding Drama (1954) that \u201cHis work sometimes recalls the past, sometimes anticipates the immediate future which he was unconsciously helping to create, and often seems to belong to no period at all.\u201d\n\r\nSouthwell\u2019s poetry is entirely religious. Like some of his Continental contemporaries, Southwell wished to turn poets\u2019 attention from the pagan, classical, often licentious subject matter typical of the period toward religious and moral themes. He explains this intention in four places: in the prefatory matter of Mary Magdalen\u2019s Funeral Tears, in the prose letter \u201cto his loving cousin\u201d accompanying his own (no longer extant) manuscript of his lyrics, and in the poems \u201cTo the Reader\u201d prefacing the short poems and Saint Peter\u2019s Complaint. \u201cPassions I allow, and loves I approve,\u201d he tells the dedicatee of the Funeral Tears, \u201conly I would wish that men would alter their object and better their intent.\u201d\n\r\nSuch appeals are characteristic, for Southwell always strives to engage his reader in contemplation of the subject of the poem. He is not content simply to announce his intention; he so expresses it that his reader will be struck by its beauty, its charm, and even by its pathos. Joseph D. Scallon relates this aspect of Southwell\u2019s technique to the compositional structures of mannerist and baroque art \u201cthat draw the viewer into the scene depicted and demand that he share the emotions of the original situation.\u201d Louis L. Martz recognizes in Southwell\u2019s style the effects of a Jesuit\u2019s training in Ignatian meditation, especially that aspect of it called \u201cthe composition of place\u201d or, as Ignatius wrote, \u201cseeing in imagination the material place where the object is that we wish to contemplate.\u201d Martz demonstrates there are parallels between Ignatius\u2019s Spiritual Exercises and the structure of some of Southwell\u2019s poems. It seems more likely, however, that Ignatian meditation was a manifestation rather than a cause of a development that occurred more or less simultaneously in various fields of European activity. In Southwell\u2019s case his training would have systematized tendencies already present in him as a poet and writer.\n\r\nThe constant themes of Southwell\u2019s poetry are the absolute beauty and truth revealed in Christ and his mother and a correspondingly absolute necessity that humanity respond to revelation with contrition, repentance, and love. The circumstances of his mission in England, where state power required Catholics to deny their religion, invested his themes with extraordinary pathos and drama. Saint Peter\u2019s Complaint is about contrition and repentance, as Nancy Pollard Brown argues, but it is also about apostasy and betrayal. The bestknown poem, \u201cThe Burning Babe,\u201d presents, as the prelude to Christmas, a vision of absolute love constant in rejection.\n\r\nAccording to the Clarendon Press edition, 57 short poems survive. The most impressive of them to 20th-century taste is probably \u201cA Vale of Tears,\u201d a paysage moralis\u00e9 of the \u201ctroubled mind\u201d based on the experience of traveling through the Alps. The Christmas hymns, \u201cNew Heaven, New War\u201d and \u201cNew Prince, New Pomp,\u201d using a simple, ballad style for lofty, complex subject matter, have also been popular since 1900. The gnomic poems such as \u201cTimes Go by Turns\u201d or \u201cLoss in Delays\u201d are the least sympathetic to modern taste, but they were greatly admired by Southwell\u2019s first readers. The one long poem, Saint Peter\u2019s Complaint, is a complex study of a mind in the process of acknowledging that for almost no reason it has betrayed the person it loves most. The style, like that of Shakespeare\u2019s Rape of Lucrece (1594)\u2014which it seems to have influenced\u2014is elaborately, even extravagantly conceitist; but the conceits are functional rather than ornamental. They serve to locate the speaker\u2019s mind in a universe of reference and sympathetic relationship.\n\r\nBy 1636 nine editions of Mary Magdalen\u2019s Funeral Tears and 14 editions of Southwell\u2019s poetry had been published in England. The cessation of the stream of editions after 1636 has been attributed to increasing Puritan sentiment; but since Shakespeare\u2019s narrative poems ceased publication at the same time, the change in taste signaled by the appearance of John Milton\u2019s Poems in 1645 is a more likely explanation. In modern times interest in Southwell has been almost wholly confined to his coreligionists, who naturally value his life more than his writings. In 1954 Martz\u2019s Poetry of Meditation placed Southwell in the mainstream of a meditative tradition in English poetry of the late 16th and 17th centuries and suggested that he was an important influence on George Herbert. The mainstream then fought back in reviews and articles, culminating in Barbara Kiefer Lewalski\u2019s Protestant Poetics (1979), which wrote Southwell out of the poetic tradition entirely. Lewis\u2019s assessment is more just, if patronizing: \u201cSouthwell\u2019s work is too small and too little varied for greatness: but it is very choice, very winning, and highly original.\u201d\n\r\nThere is no comparable assessment of Southwell\u2019s prose as a whole, but Geoffrey Hill\u2019s essay \u201cThe Absolute Reasonableness of Robert Southwell\u201d (1984) lays down the basis of one. \u201cFor Southwell,\u201d he writes, \u201c\u2018force of mind\u2019 is manifested in the power to remain unseduced and unterrified.\u201d The wonder of Southwell\u2019s short career is that he wrote so much and so well in such terrifying circumstances, and especially in the public medium of prose. Threatened with unspeakable violence and frivolity, he wrought in response, in his Epistle of Comfort, Triumphs over Death, and Humble Supplication, a lucid, reasonable, and humane style that places him among the greatest of English prose writers.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Renaissance"]}}
