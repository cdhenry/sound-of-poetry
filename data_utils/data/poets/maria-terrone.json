Her poetry ranges widely in subject, drawing inspiration from modern urban life, history, migration, and memory. Writes Dana Gioia about Eye to Eye: \u201cMaria Terrone's poems are simultaneously sensuous and spiritual, earthy and intellectual. Her imagination takes fire from contradiction and complexity. One small image\u2014washing a potato or rearranging a lingerie drawer\u2014can open up vistas of private desire or public history. Her poetry explores the contingencies of time and eternity.\u201d Reviewing Eye to Eye for The Common, Sarah Wetzel noted, \u201cTerrone sees the world in all its blemished and brutal multiplicities.\u201d  Her work, which has been published in French and Farsi, has appeared in magazines such as The Hudson Review, Ploughshares, Poetry, Poetry International, Notre Dame Review, and Crab Orchard Review. More than 20 anthologies have included her poems, including Killer Verse: Poems of Murder and Mayhem, Alfred A. Knopf Everyman\u2019s Library; Waiting Room Reader, Vol. II: Words to Keep You Company, CavanKerry Press, edited by Rachel Hadas; and anthologies from Beacon Press, The Feminist Press, and University of Notre Dame Press, among others. Honors include the McGovern Award from Ashland Poetry Press, which led to the publication of A Secret Room in Fall; the Willow Review Award for Poetry; the Elinor Benedict Poetry Prize from Passages North; and the Allen Tate Memorial Award from Wind, as well as an Individual Artist Award from the Queens Council on the Arts.Terrone, who also writes and publishes essays, was among 10 writers commissioned by The Guggenheim Museum for the Queens version of stillspotting nyc. This multidisciplinary project in 2012 took the museum\u2019s programming out into the streets of the city\u2019s five boroughs.\u00a0 Terrone works as a higher education communications consultant.
