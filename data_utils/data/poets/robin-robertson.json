His deeply sensory poems explore notions of love and loss framed by the dialogue between the classical and the contemporary. Describing the poet\u2019s task, Robertson tells of the desire to reveal \u201cthe refreshed world and, through a language thick with sound and connotation and metaphor, make some sense: some new connection between what is seen and felt and what is understood.\u201d As a reviewer for the New Yorker notes, \u201cThe genius of this Scots poet is for finding the sensually charged moment\u2014in a raked northern seascape, in a sexual or gustatory encounter\u2014and depicting it in language that is simultaneously spare and ample, and reminiscent of early Heaney or Hughes.\u201d   Robertson is the author of several collections of poetry. His debut collection, A Painted Field (1997), won the Forward Prize for Best First Collection, the Aldeburgh Poetry Festival Prize, and the Saltire Scottish First Book of the Year Award, and was one of the Sunday Times Books of the Year. Critic and author Kazuo Ishiguro praised its \u201cdarkly chiselled poems haunted by mortality and the fragility of life\u2019s pleasures.\u201d   Robertson has worked at several major London publishing houses, and has edited the work of many writers, including John Banville, John Burnside, Anne Carson, J.M. Coetzee, Seamus Deane, Anne Enright, Geoffrey Hill, Michael Longley, Sharon Olds, and Peter Redgrove.   Inspired by frank conversations with writers, Robertson edited Mortification: Writers\u2019 Stories of Their Public Shame (2003). He has recently published The Deleted World, a selection of new versions of the Swedish poet Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer (2006) and a translation of Medea (2008).   After his second collection, Slow Air, Robertson received the E.M. Forster Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. His third book, Swithering (2006), won the Forward Prize for Best Poetry Collection of the Year.   His fourth book of poems, The Wrecking Light (2010), includes \u201cAt Roane Head,\u201d which was awarded the Forward Prize for Best Single Poem. Robertson is the first poet to have won all three categories in the Forward Prize. He lives in London.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Scotland"]}}
