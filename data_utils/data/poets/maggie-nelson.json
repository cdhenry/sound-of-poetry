Her work is often described as genre crossing or hybrid; she has noted her interest in poet Eileen Myles\u2019s idea of \u201cvernacular scholarship,\u201d adding, \u201cI need to talk back, or talk with, theorists and philosophers in ordinary language, to dramatize how much their ideas matter to me in my everyday life.\u201d Nelson\u2019s book Bluets (2009) is perhaps her most well-known work mix of scholarship and poetry. Her other collections of poetry include Something Bright, Then Holes (2007), Jane: A Murder (2005), The Latest Winter (2003), and Shiner (2001), which was a finalist for a Norma Farber First Book Award. She is the author of an account of sexual violence and the media, The Red Parts: A Memoir (2007), and a critical work on the New York School poets, Women, the New York School, and Other True Abstractions (2007), which won a Susanne M. Glassock Award for Interdisciplinary Scholarship. Her critical study of aesthetics and cruelty, The Art of Cruelty: A Reckoning (2011), was named a New York Times Notable Book of the Year. Her\u00a0genre-bending memoir\u00a0The Argonauts (2015) was a finalist for the National Books Critics Circle Award.\r\n\u00a0\r\nNelson\u2019s many honors and awards include grants and fellowships from the John D. and Catherine T.
