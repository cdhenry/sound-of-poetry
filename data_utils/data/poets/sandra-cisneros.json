During her childhood, the family moved often between Chicago and Mexico. Cisneros earned a BA at Loyola University of Chicago and an MFA at the University of Iowa.\nHer writing frequently engages with the construction of feminist Latina identity, folding Spanish phrases into a hybrid, spiraling syntax that crosses languages as her characters shift between cultures. In an interview for the New York Times, Cisneros discussed the experience and power of shifting between cultures and languages, stating, \u201cI\u2019m a translator. I\u2019m an amphibian. I can travel in both worlds. What I\u2019m saying is very important for the Latino community, but it is also important for the white community to hear. What I\u2019m saying in my writing is that we can be Latino and still be American.\u201d\nCisneros is the author of several poetry collections, including Loose Woman (1994), My Wicked Wicked Ways (1987), and Bad Boys (1980). Her debut novel, The House on Mango Street (1984), won an American Book Award. Her second novel, Caramelo (2002), was selected a noteworthy book of the year by the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, and the San Francisco Chronicle. Her story collection Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories (1991) won the PEN Center West Award for Best Fiction, the Lannan Foundation Literary Award, the Quality Paperback Book Club New Voices Award, and the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award. Cisneros is also author of several children\u2019s books, including\u00a0Hairs/Pelitos (1994). Her work has been translated into more than a dozen languages. Vintage Cisneros (2003) offers a selection of her writing. In 2015, she published A House of My Own: Stories from My Life.\nPresident Obama awarded Cisneros the National Medal of the Arts in 2016. Her many other honors include a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, the Texas Medal of the Arts, fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts in both poetry and fiction, the Dobie-Paisano Fellowship from the Texas Institute of Letters, and an Illinois Artists Grant.
