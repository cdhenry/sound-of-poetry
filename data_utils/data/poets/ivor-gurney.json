Though his father was a tailor, Gurney\u2019s godfather was Alfred Hunter Cheesman, a local vicar and bachelor who encouraged him in his artistic and creative pursuits. Gurney read widely in Cheesman\u2019s library and eventually won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music, though his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. Initially rejected by the army for poor eyesight, Gurney joined the 2nd/5th Gloucesters in 1917 and served in France. He was twice wounded, the second time by gas. He returned to the Royal College of Music to study with Ralph Vaughn Williams, but his behavior became increasingly erratic and he left the school again. Gurney\u2019s moods had always been extreme\u2014he suffered from manic-depression\u2014and he had a nervous breakdown even before the war. Though he went through a period of intense creativity in the late 1910s, his mental state had deteriorated by 1921 and he was institutionalized in 1922. He spent the rest of his life in institutions and died, of tuberculosis, in the City of London Mental Hospital in 1937. Gurney continued to write both songs and poetry during his years in asylums. The composers Gerald Finzi and Howard Ferguson, as well as Gurney\u2019s close friend the musicologist Marion Scott, began collecting Gurney\u2019s work soon after his death.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBest known for his musical compositions, Gurney wrote a prodigious number of songs\u2014around 300\u2014as well as numerous chamber and instrumental works. He often set poems to music, including works by Hilaire Belloc, Will Harvey, and many Elizabethan poets. Gurney began writing poetry in earnest during World War I, sending pages to England to be typed by Scott. Gurney\u2019s first collection of poetry, Severn and Somme (1917), reflects his war experiences and love of the Gloucester countryside, as does his second volume War\u2019s Embers (1919). Gurney\u2019s later poetry continues to treat these themes, as well as details his descent into madness. Gurney\u2019s work has enjoyed a renaissance and numerous collections and reissues have appeared over the years, including Best Poems and the Book of Five Makings (1995), Seven & Somme and War\u2019s Embers (1997), 80 Poems or So (1997), Rewards of Wonder: Poems of London, Cotswold and France (2000), and Collected Poems (2004). Gurney\u2019s letters were edited by Anthony Boden and published as Stars in a Dark Night: The Letters from Ivor Gurney to the Chapman Family (2004). Biographies of Gurney include: Michael Hurd\u2019s The Ordeal of Ivor Gurney (1978; reprint 2008) and Ivor Gurney and Marion Scott: Song of Pain and Beauty (2008), by Pamela Blevins.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
