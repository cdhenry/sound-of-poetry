Lawrence\u2019s early years were spent in India, but after receiving some education at Darjiling\u2019s College of St. Joseph, Durrell moved to England to study at St. Edmund\u2019s School in Canterbury. Refused admission to Cambridge University, Durrell left England when he was 23, and spent his 20s and 30s predominantly in Greece or, during World War II, in Egypt. In 1957 he took up residence in France where he remained until his death in 1990 at the age of 78.\nDurrell is known primarily as the author of The Alexandria Quartet, (1957\u00ad\u20131960) a tetralogy of novels widely considered to be among the finest achievements in 20th-century fiction. Continuing in the tradition of James Joyce and D.H. Lawrence, Durrell experiments with the structure of the novel while also probing the human psyche. His work is infused with observations on the nature of reality and sexuality, based in part on the theories of Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. In The Alexandria Quartet, for example, Durrell employs the Einsteinian notion of space-time continuum to explore the elusive nature of truth and the potential for an infinite number of ways to approach the same material. His novels often feature a number of characters with varied interests, enabling Durrell to examine and contrast different cultural and philosophical ideas. Durrell\u2019s baroque, sensuous prose style and his vivid description of landscape have been highly praised.\nDuring the 1930s, he initiated correspondence with Henry Miller, whose erotic novels greatly influenced Durrell\u2019s work. Following Miller\u2019s advice, Durrell published The Black Book (1938) in Paris after it had failed to pass British obscenity regulations. Regarded as Durrell\u2019s first accomplished work, The Black Book protests the sterility of English society, which he termed \u201cthe English Death.\u201d By this time, Durrell had abandoned England for the Greek island of Corfu and has since lived and worked in several areas near the Mediterranean Sea. These locales figure prominently in Durrell\u2019s fiction and poetry and in his admired trilogy of island books: Prospero\u2019s Cell: A Guide to the Landscape and Manners of the Island of Corcyra (1945), Reflections on a Marine Venus: A Companion to the Landscape of Rhodes (1953), and Bitter Lemons (1957), whose subject is the island of Cyprus. During World War II, Durrell served in the British Diplomatic Corps as a press attach\u00e9; his experiences are related in his satirical Antrobus stories, which feature the title character\u2019s exploits as a British diplomat. These stories, which were published in several volumes, are collected in Antrobus Complete (1985).\nDurrell was critically considered a very good poet. In the 1930s and early 1940s, his was a beautifully modulated \u201cnew voice in a new time,\u201d as G.S. Fraser noted in Lawrence Durrell. Urbane, compassionate, often infused with loneliness yet filled with a sense of wry fun, his poems draw deeply on two traditions: the first of ancient Greece and its rebirth in the works of such modern Greek poets as Constantine Cavafy and George Seferis, and the second of the Renaissance, of Shakespeare and Donne as reinvented by the 20th-century \u201cmetaphysicals\u201d T.S. Eliot and W.H. Auden. Although Durrell journeyed with the moderns across a wasteland, his poetry is suffused with Greek light. Hayden Carruth wrote in The World of Lawrence Durrell, \u201cthe poet of the historic consciousness who is recording the end of a civilization is intimately aware of the beginning, and the figure of Homer, the blind brother in the mists of ancientness, overlooks these poems, overlooks the Quartet too, I think.\u201d Many of his lyrics, such as \u201cNemea,\u201d \u201cLesbos,\u201d and \u201cMneiae,\u201d recall the ancient Greek Anthology put together from many sources in the Byzantine period, while his character poems, with their interplay of art and idea, are closer to Cavafy. In this latter category can be placed \u201cPetron, the Desert Father\u201d and \u201cA Portrait of Theodora,\u201d the second of which reflects not only the modern Greek woman but, through her, the Byzantine empress as a girl. The character poems, especially \u201cFangbrand: A Biography,\u201d display \u201ca kind of golden fullness of expression,\u201d Derek Stanford declared in his essay collected in The World of Lawrence Durrell.\nIn his best poems, as in The Alexandria Quartet, a profound understanding both of the past and of mythology underlies Durrell\u2019s quick and lively awareness of the present, with its attendant humor and many sorrows. Among these poems is \u201cDeus Loci,\u201d a kind of classical hymn to the \u201csmall sunburnt\u201d god a charming and elegant personification of the spirit of place. Friedman wrote in Lawrence Durrell and The Alexandria Quartet that \u201cDeus Loci\u201d ... \u201coffers an archetypal treatment of place that pervading, ever-recurring motif that may serve as a paradigm not only for the bulk of Durrell\u2019s poetry but also for such works as Sappho, the island books, and the Quartet.\u201d Another of his best-known poems, \u201cAlexandria,\u201d evokes the atmosphere of the city and the poet\u2019s own loneliness, \u201cthe artist at his papers / Up there alone, upon the alps of night.\u201d\nDurrell\u2019s poetry has been seen as moving from early lyrics to the classically based and metaphysically strong poems of his middle years. His later poetry, more conversational in tone, becomes even stronger in its anguished concern with \u201cthe three big words of Durrell\u2019s poetic vocabulary ... art, love, and death,\u201d according to Ian S. MacNiven in Critical Essays. One of the most moving of these poems is the elegy, \u201cSeferis.\u201d Poems such as \u201cA Patch of Dust\u201d and \u201cLast Heard Of\u201d evince a remarkable sureness and power. In reflecting a maturing style, Durrell\u2019s poetic works form a kind of Ars poetica, a portrait of the developing artist.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
