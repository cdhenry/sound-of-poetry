Trained as an accountant and teacher, Cobbing is best known for his work as publisher of Writers Forum and pioneering visual, concrete, and sound poetry and performances. An important force in avant-garde British poetry, Cobbing managed Better Books, home to many literary and artistic happenings in London\u2019s underground literary scene in the 1960s. Cobbing also helped found the Association of Little Presses and Poets Conference, as well as serving on the Poetry Society council. From 1963 to 2002 he published hundreds of pamphlets and books of experimental poetry under the Writers\u2019 Forum aegis.  \u00a0 Cobbing\u2019s work drew on elements of concrete and sound poetry; he foregrounded language as material, as sign or mark, while developing sound as an element of non-semantic meaning. Cobbing wrote of his practice in \u201cSome Statements on Sound Poetry\u201d: \u201cGone is the word as word, though the word may still be used as sound or shape. Poetry now resides in other elements.\u201d Those other elements, as Robert Sheppard noted in his obituary for Cobbing, included not just \u201cany mark\u2014whether letter-shape, lip imprint, or inkblot\u2026on the page,\u201d but \u201cmoaning, sighing, shouting, even sneezing.\u201d Cobbing\u2019s first work of visual poetry was the sequence \u201cABC In Sound\u201d (1964); other works include Kurrirrurriri (1967), So: Six Sound Poems (1968), Whisper Piece (1969), Etcetera: A New Collection of Found and Sound Poems (1970), Chronology Sound Poetry (1974), And Avocado (1977), and The Kollekted Kris Kringle Volume IV (1979), among others. Cobbing died in 2002.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
