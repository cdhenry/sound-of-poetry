Yevtushenko rose to prominence following the publication of his long poem Babiyy Yar, a work about the Nazi massacre of Jewish citizens in Kiev and the Soviet Union\u2019s refusal to acknowledge it. Notable Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich set the poem to music shortly after its publication. Many years later, in 1991, Yevtushenko received in the American Liberties Medallion: the highest honor conferred by the American Jewish Committee.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAs with several other poets of his generation, Yevtushenko had the odd distiction of being a celebrated dissident during a fairly repressive time. This notoriety brought him some success, leading to performances in packed stadiums and frequent reading tours abroad, but also left him open to criticism from both the Soviet government and those that felt his criticisms didn\u2019t go far enough. He appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1962.\r\n\u00a0\r\nYevtushenko lived in both Russia and the United States before his death in 2017. He taught English and Russian poetry at the University of Tulsa and at Queens College, CUNY.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Russia"]}}
