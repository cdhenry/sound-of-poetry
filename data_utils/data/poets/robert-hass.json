Critics celebrate Hass\u2019s own poetry for its clarity of expression, its concision, and its imagery, often drawn from everyday life. \u201cHass has noted his own affinity for Japanese haiku,\u201d the poet\u00a0Forrest Gander remarked, \u201cand his work similarly attends to the details of quotidian life with remarkable clarity.\u201d Gander described Hass\u2019s gift for \u201cmusical, descriptive, meditative poetry.\u201d Carolyn Kizer\u00a0wrote in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0that Hass\u201d\u00a0is so intelligent that to read his poetry or prose, or to hear him speak, gives one an almost visceral pleasure.\u201d Hass told interviewer David Remnick in the\u00a0Chicago Review, \u201cPoetry is a way of living. \u2026\u00a0a human activity like baking bread or playing basketball.\u201d\n\r\nHass\u2019s first collection,\u00a0Field Guide\u00a0(1973),\u00a0won the Yale Series of Younger Poets Award. It drew\u00a0on Hass\u2019s native California countryside and background in Slavic studies. \u201cThe poems in\u00a0Field Guide,\u201d wrote Gander, \u201care rich with Russian accents, aromas of ferny anise and uncorked wines, and references to plant and animal life: the green whelks and rock crabs, tanagers and Queen Anne\u2019s lace, sea spray and pepper trees of the Bay Area.\u201d In the Southwest Review\u00a0Michael Waters\u00a0declared, \u201cField Guide\u00a0is a means of naming things, of establishing an identity through one\u2019s surroundings, of translating the natural world into one\u2019s private history. This is a lot to accomplish, yet Robert Hass manages it with clarity and compassion.\u201d Hass confirmed his ability with\u00a0Praise\u00a0(1979),\u00a0his second volume of poems, which won the William Carlos Williams Award. \u201cIn many ways,\u201d Gander explained, \u201cPraise\u00a0addresses the problems implicit in the first book: Can the act of naming the world separate us from the world? How is it possible to bear grief, to accept death, and how can the spirit endure?\u201d Writing in the\u00a0Chicago Review,\u00a0Ira Sadoff\u00a0remarked that\u00a0Praise\u00a0\u201cmight even be the strongest collection of poems to come out in the late seventies \u2026 [It] marks Hass\u2019s arrival as an important, even pivotal, young poet.\u201d\n\r\nIn 1984, Hass published\u00a0Twentieth Century Pleasures: Prose on Poetry,\u00a0a collection of previously published essays and reviews. In the volume, the author examines American writers (including\u00a0Robert Lowell\u00a0and\u00a0James Wright) as well as European and Japanese poets. The book was well-received and won many awards, including the National Book Critics Circle Award. \u201cMr. Hass\u2019s style balances conversational directness and eloquent complexity,\u201d noted\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0contributor Anthony Libby. He concluded that \u201cMr. Hass believes that poetry is what defines the self, and it is his ability to describe that process that is the heart of this book\u2019s pleasure.\u201d\n\r\nSince the publication of\u00a0Twentieth Century Pleasures,\u00a0Hass has continued to write both poetry and prose. His third collection of poetry,\u00a0Human Wishes\u00a0(1989),\u00a0experimented with longer lines and prose paragraphs, privileging process and meditation over the images that had filled his earlier work. David Barber, writing for the\u00a0Boston Review,\u00a0noted that Hass had \u201ccultivated a more open, intimately epistolary verse that makes room for everything from strenuous metaphysics, beguiling storytelling, and wry recollections to haiku-like snapshots, flinty epigrams, and tremulous lyricism.\u201d The\u00a0Nation\u00a0critic\u00a0Don Bogen explained that\u00a0Human Wishes\u00a0\u201dreveals [Hass\u2019s] basic concerns: He is a student of desire, of what we want and how likely we are to get it.\u201d \u201cIn\u00a0Human Wishes,\u201d Bogen concluded, \u201cRobert Hass captures both the brightness of the world and its vanishing.\u201d\n\r\nHass paid tribute to some of his non-Western mentors in\u00a0The Essential Haiku: Versions of Basho, Buson, and Issa\u00a0(1994),\u00a0translations of short works by the most famous masters of the short Japanese poem. \u201cThe translations \u2026 must by anyone\u2019s standard be considered remarkable poetic achievements in themselves,\u201d wrote Andrew Rathmann in the\u00a0Chicago Review, \u201c[They\u2019re] comparable\u2014in terms of sheer written fluency\u2014to the best poems in his three previous books\u201d of poetry. When it was published in the mid-90s, Hass\u2019s book also brought a traditional Japaense poetic form to an American audience.\nHass\u2019s other major work as a translator is his decades-long project of translating the Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz. With Milosz, Hass has translated over seven collections of the Nobel Prize-winning poet\u2019s work. In an interview with\u00a0Guernica, Hass talked about the influence of Milosz on his own thinking about poetry and politics. \u201cYou can aim for perfection if you stay away from the hard subjects. But if you\u2019re going to do what Milosz does, you can\u2019t aim for perfection; your work is going to be messy and opinionated,\u201d Hass argued.\nHass's next collection of poems,\u00a0Sun Under Wood\u00a0(1996) won\u00a0the National Book Critics Circle Award. The book is more explicitly autobiographical, and includes poems about Hass\u2019s childhood and alcoholic mother. In Poetry\u00a0contributor\u00a0David Baker\u2019s opinion,\u00a0\u201cHass\u2019s new volume contains many of his most important works to date \u2026 All through\u00a0Sun\u00a0Under Wood,\u00a0Hass\u2019s ability to convert the comedic to sublime, the anecdotal to the metaphysical and ethical, the personal to the social, is remarkable.\u201d But not all critics found the collection compelling.\u00a0Peter Davison\u00a0of the\u00a0Atlantic Monthly\u00a0admitted that while Hass\u2019s famous \u201ccharm and modesty\u201d remained, \u201cthese poems keep relaxing into the voice of an onlooker rather than taking on the energy of full participation\u2014as though they came to the poet through a window, a filter, a screen of white noise and unscented air.\u201d\n\r\nFrom 1995 to 1997, Hass set aside his personal role as poet to take up the mantle of the nation\u2019s poet, serving as U.S. poet laureate. A largely ceremonial position, historically speaking, the poet laureate has recently become far more of a public advocate for poets and their work. In a sense, the new role was a logical extension of Hass\u2019s personal, private work to a public arena. In Mother Jones, Sarah Pollock wrote,\u00a0\u201cHass\u2019s tenure as poet laureate has been a more public expression of the lifelong concerns that inform his poetry: a close attention to the natural world, a sense of self developed in relation to the landscape, and acute awareness of both the pleasures and pains of being human.\u201d\nThe laureate position also heightened the political sensibilities of the poet and his work. Hass recognized early on that the realms of politics and business seemed to have little use for poetry and other arts. Hass focused on promoting poetic literacy, telling Francis X. Clines in the\u00a0New York Times, \u201cI thought an interesting thing to do would be to go where poets don\u2019t go.\u201d He visited businesses, convincing some to support poetry contests for students, and spoke to civic groups, trying to broaden their horizons. Because of these efforts, \u201cRobert Hass is the most active Poet Laureate of the United States we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d wrote\u00a0Los Angeles Times Book Review\u00a0contributor Frances Mayes, \u201cand he sets a standard for those who follow.\u201d\nAfter his tenure as poet laureate, Hass remained in the public realm, teaching, translating, editing and writing newspaper columns. As\u00a0Stephanie Burt\u00a0noted, \u201call that service seems to have strengthened Hass\u2019s powers.\u201d Hass\u2019s first book post-laureate,\u00a0Time and Materials: Poems 1997-2005\u00a0(2007), \u201cshows the worth of playing against type, the survival of his private talent and the artistic uses of his public life,\u201d wrote Burt. In addition to poems about art and artists, meditations on middle age, and descriptions of a California well-known to Hass\u2019s readers, the book also features poetry engaged with world affairs, contemporary politics and, notably, \u201cBush\u2019s War\u201d in Iraq. Dan Chiasson, in the\u00a0New Yorker, noted that the continuity between\u00a0Time and Materials\u00a0and Hass\u2019s previous work: \u201cHass\u2019s wish to make poems resemble the world as closely as possible (his often remarked stylistic \u2018clarity\u2019) has been a constant in his method from the start; what has changed is not the style but the vision of the world.\u201d Unanimously praised by critics as a supremely well-crafted collection,\u00a0Time and Materials\u00a0won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize. Hass\u2019s most recent book is The Apple Trees at Olema (2010), a collection of new and selected poems.\nIn the mid-1990s, Hass cofounded River of Words, an organization that teaches ecoliteracy through multidisciplinary, interactive curricula. In addition to serving as the U.S. poet laureate, Hass was a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets from 2001 to 2007. In 2014, he won the Wallace Stevens Award from the Academy of American Poets.\nHass is Distinguished Professor in Poetry and Poetics at the University of California, Berkeley, and lives in California with his wife, the poet\u00a0Brenda Hillman.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
