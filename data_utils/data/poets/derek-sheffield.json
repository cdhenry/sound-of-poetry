Alison Hawthorne Deming noted in Terrain.org how his work is \u201cfull of keen attentions to world and word\u201d that \u201cdemonstrate a crafty formal intelligence and a gift for empathic seeing\u201d that gives \u201cagency to every living thing.\u201d In Shenandoah, William Wright called Sheffield \u201cone of the Northwest\u2019s most important ecologically centered writers\u201d in whose work \u201cwilderness enriches us, makes us more human, and reminds us of our own primordial origins.\u201d In Orion, Chris Dombrowski called Sheffield\u2019s work \u201cthe rarest of finds in our current literary milieu,\u201d noting how his poems \u201camplify the reader's experience with the natural world.\u201d And in his prize commendation, Mark Doty noted that Sheffield \u201cachieves something of inestimable value: a trustworthy, convincing voice.\u201d\nSheffield has taught at the Northwest Institute of Literary Arts, the University of Washington, Central Washington University, Clackamas Community College, and Wenatchee Valley College. Since 2013, he has been the poetry editor of Terrain.org. He lives in Leavenworth, Washington.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
