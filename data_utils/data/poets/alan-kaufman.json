A Celebration of New Jewish Visions (1995, with Danny Shot) and editing the magazine Davka: Jewish Cultural Revolution.

Tower for\u00a0Riding the Meridian,\u00a0Kaufman notes that the web \u201cawakened two compulsions: to produce work as part of it and to comment upon it [...] I can assemble things too, as experiments in contextualization.\u201d Kaufman is also the editor of The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry (1999, co-edited with S.A. Griffin) and The Outlaw Bible of American Literature (2004, co-edited with Barney Rosset and Neil Ortenberg).
