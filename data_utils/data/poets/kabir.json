He grew up in a family of Muslim weavers before becoming a disciple of the Hindu ascetic Ramananda. Kabir is considered both a Sufi and Brahmin saint.\r\n\u00a0\r\nKabir\u2019s poetry draws on both Hinduism and Islam, though he was critical of certain aspects of both faiths. Some of his verses are included in the compilation of Sikh scriptures known as the Adi Granth. His mystical poems are grounded in the details and earthly particulars of everyday life. Poet Mary Karr, featuring one of Kabir\u2019s poems in the \u201cPoet\u2019s Choice\u201d column in the Washington Post, noted that \u201cKabir lists \u2018birds and animals and the ant\u2019 in a way that draws the eye from the soaring sky to the earth\u2019s crawly, exoskeletal creatures. In doing so he connects a vague, blank heaven and the tiny, miraculous particulars.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nKabir\u2019s poems have been collected in One Hundred Poems of Kabir; Translated by Rabindranath Tagore, Assisted by Evelin Underhill (2005) and Kabir: Ecstatic Poems, versions by Robert Bly (2007).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\ufeff\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Asia, South"]}}
