He edited In the American Tree (1986), which remains the primary Language poetry anthology, as well as penned one of the movement\u2019s defining critical texts, The New Sentence (1987). Silliman\u2019s prolific publishing career includes over forty books of poetry, critical work, collaborations and anthologies. He has long championed experimental or post-avant poetics, most recently through Silliman\u2019s Blog, a weblog he started in 2002. Silliman\u2019s is one of the most popular and frequently visited of the many contemporary English-language poetry blogs; by 2010 the blog had received three million visits. Silliman has taught at various universities including San Francisco State University, University of California-Berkeley, Brown and the Naropa Institute. He has also worked as a political organizer, ethnographer, lobbyist, and was the executive editor of the Socialist Review. A long-time resident of the Bay Area, he moved to Pennsylvania in 1995 and teaches at the University of Pennsylvania.\nEarly on, Silliman published poems with such mainstream journals as Poetry Northwest and TriQuarterly, but his association with Language poetry has defined much of his subsequent work. In an article for the Nation, essayist Hank Lazer described language poetry as \u201cfollowing upon the most adventurous work of Gertrude Stein, Louis Zukofsky, William Carlos Williams and Jack Spicer,\u201d adding that \u201clanguage writing can be seen as an oppositional literary practice that questions many of the assumptions of mainstream poetry. Instead of considering poetry as a staging ground for the creation and expression of an \u2018authentic\u2019 voice and personality, language poetry arises out of an \u2018exploded self,\u2019 blurs genre boundaries \u2026 and seeks actively collaborative relationships between reader and writer.\u201d The political angle of language poetry was discussed by Keith Tuma in the Chicago Review. \u201cThere is for some the desire to identify and distinguish from other poetry a specifically oppositional poetry,\u201d Tuma wrote. \u201cOften this means overstating the cohesiveness of poetic orthodoxies and their difference from dominant ideologies.\u201d\nSilliman\u2019s influential collection of critical essays, The New Sentence, linked literary \u201crealism\u201d with bourgeoisie capitalism, and showed how both could be undermined by \u201cthe new sentence.\u201d Silliman described the \u201cnew sentence\u201d as one that controlled or minimized the \u201csyllogistic\u201d meaning expected from prose by altering the structure, length, and placement of the sentence to increase its ambiguity or polysemy. Reviewing the book for Tremblor 7, George Hartley described \u201cwhat Silliman looks for in a poem, and why the new sentence fulfills his demands\u201d as \u201c1) intensity; 2) power; 3) a charged use of linguistic units; 4) recurrence; 5) parallel structures; 6) a common image bank; 7) secondary syllogistic movement; 8) the systematic blocking of primary syllogistic movement; 9) varied tenses; 10) ambiguity; 11) importance; 12) tension; 13) an exploration and articulation of the hidden capacities of the blank space (parataxis).\u201d \u00a0Bob Perelman described it as a \u201cterm that is both descriptive of a writing procedure and, at times, a sign of literary-political proselytizing.\u201d\n\u00a0In 1974 Silliman began working on a long poem or life-work he calls Ketjak, after the Balinese word for \u201cmonkey\u201d and a ritual performance done by the islanders for tourists. When finished, Ketjak will be composed of four long poems The Age of Huts (1974-1980; first published 1986, compleat in 2007), Tjanting (1979-1981; published 1981), The Alphabet (1979-2004; published 2008), and Universe (2005-present; Revelator, the first volume, published 2013). Ketjak is also the name of the book-length poem Silliman published in 1978, and is the first section of The Age of Huts. Intimately connected with Silliman\u2019s interest in poetics and critical theory, the poem Ketjak also made use of \u201cnew sentence\u201d techniques. Perelman described the work as \u201cwritten in a series of expanding paragraphs where the sentences of one paragraph are repeated in order in subsequent paragraphs with additional sentences inserted between them, recontextualizing them. As the paragraphs double, the space between the reoccurrence of the sentences doubles and the context from which they reemerge grows thicker. In this, they have reminded some in the language movement of characters in a novel. But the narrative effect is more peculiar as the sentences keep reappearing against different sentences.\u201d According to T.C. Marshall in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, \u201cthe book employs a disjunctive version of modernist juxtaposition, one that is put up beside or against the familiar procedures of prosaic logic. The disjunctive quality of the sentences and paragraphs of Ketjak reveals the dependence of conjunctive logic upon one\u2019s acquiescence in habits of reading. Ketjak is the opposite of casual or causal collage; it does not push toward a whole so much as it reveals the habitual urge toward assembling what Silliman, in his interview in The Difficulties special issue and elsewhere, has called \u2018the tyranny of the whole.\u2019\u201d\nTjanting (1981), the second part of Ketjak, is written according to the principles of the Fibonacci number sequence. In Postmodern American Poetry, Paul Hoover described the book as \u201can eccentric form of [Silliman\u2019s] own invention \u2026 with the result that the number of sentences in each paragraph equals the number of sentences in the previous two paragraphs.\u201d In the 1980s, Silliman began what is known as \u201cThe Alphabet\u201d series, which was published in its entirety in 2008 as The Alphabet. A long book made of smaller books, each of which focuses on a different letter of the alphabet, the series employs the familiar Silliman \u201cnew sentence\u201d to reflect on the role of writing in lived experience. Silliman published many of the smaller books individually, before collecting them; R.D. Pohl in the Buffalo News commented that the volume \u00ae (\u201cCircle R\u201d), published in 2000, presented \u201ca remarkably focused and attentive sensibility fully alive and engaged by the ordinariness of its own experience, without striving after higher orders of meaning and consequence.\u201d In his discussion of another section of the work, first published as LIT (1987), Lazer explained that \u201cin spite of its careful constructions, LIT feels neither rigid nor constrained. Silliman\u2019s writing is fun to read: Its pleasure lies in the gradual unfolding of intricate forms and in the mix of puns, declarations, sounds and sights from our daily environment, the range of references from philosophy to baseball.\u201d Lazer continued, \u201cAs with the repetition and modulation of basic rhythm and melodies in the minimalist music of Philip Glass or Steve Reich, key words and sentences echo throughout LIT, providing a pleasing familiarity and recurrence.\u201d\nSince completing work on The Alphabet, Silliman has turned his hand toward memoir and experiments in autobiography. His memoir Under Albany (2004) was named Book of the Year by Small Press Traffic. The poet Charles Bernstein described is as a \u201cconstructivist memoir,\u201d adding that it \u201cprovides an exquisitely rich exploration of the relation of context to reference, subtext to meaning, back story to presented experience, and composition to poetics. All of Silliman\u2019s work unravels and reforms in this exemplary and exhilarating act of attention, recollection, and reflection.\u201d Silliman is also a contributor to The Grand Piano, a collective autobiography involving original members of the Language movement that focuses on their memories and impressions of the years in the 1970s when they were most active. The title of the series takes its name from a coffee shop in San Francisco that hosted a weekly poetry and performance series influential in the group\u2019s formation.\nSilliman once said of his own writing, \u201cI have, from the beginning, taken poetry to be the most intense relation possible between self and language (hence meaning-mind-world), but, coming from a basically traditional background, it has taken years to drop the pretenses of prevailing modes and admit it: form is passion, passion form. Given forms (whether the sonnet or the Pound-derived projectivist mode) disinterest me since they are usually ways of shoving the language in a work aside.\u201d Though his eschewal of \u201cprevailing modes\u201d has meant he is often labeled as \u201cexperimental\u201d or obscure, Silliman has argued against the misconception that he is in some way a \u201cdifficult\u201d poet. In an interview with David Hoenigman, Silliman noted: \u201cI was pleased the other day when Andrew Ervin reviewed The Alphabet for The Philadelphia Inquirer and said reading my work was no more difficult than looking out of the window of a SEPTA train here in Philly \u2026 It\u2019s good to see that some people are getting it, that you can just read what\u2019s there and that will tell you everything you need to know about my work.\u201d\nRon Silliman\u2019s latest book is an expanded edition of Legend (University of New Mexico Press, 2020), his collaboration with Bruce Andrews, Charles Bernstein, Steve McCaffery, and the late Ray DiPalma. Silliman\u2019s honors and awards include the Levinson Prize and fellowships from the Kelly Writers House, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Pennsylvania Arts Council, and the Pew Arts Foundation. He has been honored with a plaque in a poetry walk in Berkeley, California, and with a sculpture in the Transit Center of Bury, Lancaster. His poetry and criticism have been translated into 16 languages. He lives in the Philadelphia area and teaches at the University of Pennsylvania.\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Language Poetry"]}}
