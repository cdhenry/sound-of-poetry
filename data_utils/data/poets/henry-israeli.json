He is the author of three collections of poetry:\u00a0New Messiahs\u00a0(Four Way Books, 2002),\u00a0Praying to the Black Cat\u00a0(Del Sol, 2010), and\u00a0god\u2019s breath hovering across the waters\u00a0(Four Way Books, 2016). The child of a Holocaust survivor and an immigrant to the United States, Israeli is keenly aware of how legacies of historical traumas shape and inflect his verse. In an interview with the\u00a0Massachusetts Review, he noted, \u201cAs an immigrant I see my adopted home from the perspective of the Other. Now, more than ever, in this new golden age of greed, lies, and corruption, I feel displaced, like a refugee in a foreign land, and this dissociation with my environment definitely feeds into my writing.\u201d\nIsraeli has also translated the Albanian poet\u00a0Luljeta Lleshanaku\u00a0in collections such as\u00a0Haywire\u00a0(Bloodaxe, 2011),\u00a0Child of Nature\u00a0(with\u00a0Shpresa Qatipi, New Directions, 2010), and\u00a0Fresco: Selected Poetry of Luljeta Lleshanaku\u00a0(New Directions, 2002). His honors and awards include fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Canada Council for the Arts. Founding editor of the poetry press Saturnalia Books, Israeli is an associate professor at Drexel University, where he directs the Drexel Writing Festival. He lives outside Philadelphia.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
