In 1991, Wesley immigrated with her family to southern Michigan to escape the Liberian civil war. She earned a BA at the University of Liberia, an MS at Indiana University, and a PhD at Western Michigan University.\n\r\nVulnerable in their combination of grief and levity, Wesley\u2019s poems deal with family, community, and war. \u201cWhat I try to do in my poetry is to show that the artist does not exist in isolation from his surroundings,\u201d Wesley has stated in interviews.\n\r\nThe author of several collections of poetry, including Where the Road Turns (2010), The River Is Rising (2007), Crab Orchard Series in Poetry\u2013winner Becoming Ebony (2003), and Before the Palm Could Bloom: Poems of Africa (1998), her poems have also been featured in former US Poet Laureate Ted Kooser\u2019s syndicated newspaper column, \u201cAmerican Life in Poetry.\u201d\n\r\nAdditional honors include the Victor E. Ward Foundation Crystal Award for Contributions to Liberian Literature, an Irving S. Gilmore Emerging Artist Grant from the Kalamazoo Foundation, an Art Fund Individual Artist Grant from the Arts Council of Greater Kalamazoo, and a World Bank Fellowship.\n\r\nShe lives with her family in west-central Pennsylvania and has taught at Pennsylvania State University and Indiana University of Pennsylvania.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
