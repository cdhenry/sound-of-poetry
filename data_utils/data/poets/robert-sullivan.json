He earned an MA from the University of Auckland. Sullivan is the author of more than 12 books of poetry, including Jazz Waiata (1990); Star Waka (1999), short-listed for the 2000 Montana New Zealand Book Awards; Weaving Earth and Sky (2002); Voice Carried My Family (2005); and Shout Ha! to the Sky (2010). His poems examine M\u0101ori culture; in a review, Craig Santos Perez says, \u201cSullivan shifts through the ever-changing terms of an oral tradition into the scripted presence of the word. \u2026 Sullivan suggests that the poem is a site for the intersections of M\u0101ori identity to enter into critical and lyric dialogue.\u201d\nSullivan edits the online journal trout and teaches creative writing at the Manukau Institute of Technology.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Pacific Islands"]}}
