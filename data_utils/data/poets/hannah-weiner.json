In the 1970s, she began to compose poems (her \u201cclairvoyant poems\u201d) based on the words she saw on her forehead and other surfaces.\nReviewing the work Hannah Weiner\u2019s Open House (2007) in the Boston Review, poet and critic Joyelle McSweeney noted that Wiener\u2019s work \u201ccontinually tests and knocks against the visual boundaries of text as it attempts to create an audial-visionary experience no conventional prose could hold.\u201d Weiner\u2019s published collections include a volume from her pre-clairvoyant period, The Magritte Poems (1970); Clairvoyant Journal (1973); Little Books / Indians (1980); Code Poems (1982); poems based on international maritime codes, SPOKE (1984); The Fast (1992); We Speak Silent (1996); and the compilation Hannah Weiner\u2019s Open House.\nWeiner received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1986. She died in 1997.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
