According to Henry Marx in Drama Review, Stramm was not only the most experimental German writer of his time but also \u201ca precursor, if not already a true culmination point of Expressionism.\u201d Little in Stramm\u2019s early life, however, indicated that he would achieve literary renown. He had a middle-class childhood as the son of a petty official who pushed the boy toward a career in the German postal service\u2014against the wishes of the child\u2019s Catholic mother, who fervently desired that her son enter the priesthood. Stramm attended gymnasiums in Dueren, Eupen, and Aix-la-Chappelle and then received a position in the German Postal Administration in 1893. Continuing his training while apprenticed there, he studied administrative law, economics, finance, and communications technology at the Post and Telegraphy School in Berlin and qualified for an advanced position in 1902. From 1905 to 1908, he studied at the University of Berlin, and in 1909 earned a PhD from the University of Halle. His dissertation topic was \u201chistorical, critical, and cameralistic investigation of the letter postage rates of the Universal Postal Union and their foundations.\u201d\nBetween 1897 and 1902, Stramm often traveled to New York City as a member of the German Postal Administration\u2019s Overseas Department. It is possible that he became acquainted, while there, with experimental American writings. Marx wrote that Stramm\u2019s letters indicate that he was familiar with the work of Ralph Waldo Trine and Prentice Mulford. Other literary influences included Arno Holz and Maurice Maeterlinck.\nStramm did not begin writing seriously until 1902, when he began work on his first play, The Peasants; it was completed in 1905, but was not produced until 1929. What is crucial in Stramm\u2019s work, Richard Sheppard argued, is the \u201cimmense gap between [his] ideal beliefs and the implications of his experience, especially after the outbreak of war.\u201d The critic quoted from Stramm\u2019s letters home from the front to convey the extent of his shock and horror; in a letter to his wife in 1915, Stramm described the \u201chowling of the heavy shells\u201d as the noises of wild beasts, and declared, \u201cIt was not world, but underworld.\u201d He expressed a similar sense of unreality in a 1914 letter to Walden: \u201cWretched, cowardly, treacherous terror, and the very air sniggers sneeringly as well and gurgles and thunders down from the mountains ... It\u2019s none of it true and all of it a lie.\u201d\nStramm, Sheppard explained, had been excited about his awareness that reality was composed not of static objects but of dynamic energies, but \u201cwhereas, in the days of peace, Stramm had ... been able to reconcile [that dynamic] theoretically with a sense of inherent providential order, his experience of war opened up an ever-widening gap between those two concepts.\u201d This erosion of faith led Stramm to further experiments with syntax; these new linguistic patterns, Sheppard suggested, \u201cdiminish[ed] the elements that make for synthesis and connectedness\u201d in language. Indeed, the critic went on to claim: \u201cAs the War went on, Stramm increasingly lost his faith in the necessary, and, in the strict sense, essential connection between language and reality, and, concomitantly, in the ability of language to pin things down.\u201d Aware that the very tradition of literature as a reflection of reality was under threat in his era, Stramm \u201cwas increasingly compelled to forgo that ease of expression which betokens an imagination at one with its own assumptions, and to resort to a tortured mode of writing in which the poet seeks to grasp and stabilize those forces.\u201d Reading Stramm\u2019s poetry as \u201ca conflict between two simultaneously present but fundamentally irreconcilable belief systems,\u201d Sheppard pointed out that Stramm \u201cexperienced those dilemmas ... as acutely painful problems which involved his whole personality, not just his abstracting intellect, and it is for this reason that his strange, challenging poetry will continue to intrigue long after so much of the autistic inflation which currently passes for \u2018theory\u2019 has been consigned to the waste-paper baskets of intellectual history.\u201d\nIn 1913, Stramm was made a captain in the Prussian Army. During World War I, he saw action on both the eastern and western fronts. He survived more than seventy battles, and became perversely fascinated, according to Sheppard, with the \u201cprimal violence of battle.\u201d In his 1914 letter to Walden, quoted by the critic, Stramm wrote: \u201cWe ourselves are demons and laugh at all the others. That\u2019s how the soldier in the field feels ... He kicks the earth and shoots the sky / Heaven to death. And horror is within him and around him, he himself is horror.\u201d Stramm was killed during an attack in the Rokitno Swamps, Gorodenka, Russia, on September 1, 1915.\nAfter Stramm\u2019s death, Walden continued the task of publishing his work. Walden published Du: Liebesgedichte, the first collection of Stramm\u2019s poems, in 1915. These early poems, according to Christoph Herin in the Encyclopedia of World Literature, explored \u201clove as a cosmic experience\u201d and eroticism in all its manifestations, \u201cfrom the sacred to the profane.\u201d Stramm\u2019s wartime poems, included with his earliest poems in the 1919 collection Tropfblut, are \u201cimpressionistic sketches of war and death or abstract word groupings.\u201d Stramm\u2019s later plays, including Erwachen, Kr\u00e4fte, and Geschehen, were also published posthumously. Herin also observed that his work influenced the Dada movement and \u201cforeshadowed the techniques of modern concrete poetry.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Germany"]}}
