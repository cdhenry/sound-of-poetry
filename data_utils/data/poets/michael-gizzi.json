He earned his BA and MFA from Brown University, where he was involved with Burning Deck, a small press run by Keith and Rosmarie Waldrop. After graduation, Gizzi worked as a tree surgeon before moving to western Massachusetts to teach at Lenox High School; he later held teaching positions at Roger Williams College and Brown University. He worked as an editor for various presses and magazines, including Hard Press, Lingo, and Qua Books. His full-length poetry collections include Bird As (1976), Avis (1979), Species of Intoxication (1983), Continental Harmony (1991), No Both (1997), My Terza Rima (2001), and New Depths of Deadpan (2009). He has written many chapbooks, including Just Like a Real Italian Kid (1990) and Too Much Johnson (1999).  \u00a0 Gizzi\u2019s work is known for its verbal exuberance and mordant wit. In a review of New Depths of Deadpan for Jacket2, Nico Alvarado noted, \u201cthe word \u2018deadpan\u2019derives from an old usage of \u2018pan\u2019for \u2018face.\u2019 It is a physical, visual description that also means something tonal, audible, and abstract, and Gizzi returns again and again to that intersection, where the senses are conflated and the impossible is made palpable.\u201d Gizzi\u2019s own comments on his work suggested he was after \u201cthe radical possibility that anything is possible.\u201d His puns, play, and sonic hijinks catch and turn language in startling ways. Gizzi\u2019s friend and sometimes collaborator John Yau described the effect as \u201cnot images or stories, but the constant music of American speech that Gizzi celebrates and dismantles, however grim, disturbing, and dark it might be.\u201d \u00a0 Gizzi\u2019s collaborations with poets such as Clark Coolidge, as well as his openness to processes and procedures from the visual and plastic arts, meant that his work sometimes occupied registers and wavelengths that exceeded semantic sense. Gizzi also acknowledged the supreme importance of music to his work. In an interview with ArtVoice, he described \u201cthe insistent and spontaneous immediacy of jazz. I start listening and then just wait for the words in the form of pictures, neologisms, puns. It\u2019s all an open conduit to what you hear could make all the difference.\u201d  \u00a0 Gizzi\u2019s honors and awards included two Gertrude Stein Awards for Innovative Writing and grants from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, the Fund for Poetry, and the Massachusetts Foundation. In his statement for the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, Gizzi concluded, \u201cI have faith in the human spirit, as well as in the cosmic joke that suggests we are merely parsecs of light fortunate enough to be passing through some vastness of space, at this, our moment.\u201d He died suddenly in his home in Providence, Rhode Island, in 2010. The editor and poet William Corbett published Elegies for Michael Gizzi (2012) to \u201ccelebrate both his friend and friendship.\u201d Gizzi\u2019s collected poems, edited by\u00a0Clark Coolidge and Craig Watson,\u00a0arrived in April of 2015 from The Figures Literary Small Press.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
