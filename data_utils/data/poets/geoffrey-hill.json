He was born in 1932\u00a0in Worcestershire, England to\u00a0a working-class family.\u00a0He attended Oxford University, where his work was first published by the U.S. poet Donald Hall. These poems later collected in For the Unfallen: Poems 1952-1958\u00a0marked an astonishing debut. In dense poems of gnarled syntax and astonishing rhetorical power, Hill planted the seeds of style and concern that he cultivated over his long career. Hill\u2019s work is noted for its seriousness, its high moral tone, extreme allusiveness and dedication to history, theology, and philosophy. In early collections such as King Log (1968)\u00a0and Mercian Hymns (1971), Hill sought\u00a0\u201cto convey extreme emotions by opposing the restraint of established form to the violence of his insight or judgment,\u201d according to New York Review of Books critic Irvin Ehrenpreis. \u201cHe deals with violent public events... Appalled by the moral discontinuities of human behavior, he is also shaken by his own response to them, which mingles revulsion with fascination.\u201d\n\r\nBoth King Log and Mercian Hymns, a series of prose poems combining memories of Hill\u2019s childhood with tales of the eighth-century Mercian king, Offa, are acclaimed for their use of Christian symbolism combined with what Craig Raine called the \u201chigh seriousness\u201d of the poet\u2019s style. In a New Statesman review of Mercian Hymns, Raine added that a reader of Hill\u2019s work \u201ccan\u2019t miss the noble application of scruples to life. The purged cadences, the bitter medicine of his syntax appeals to the puritan in us: even when the poetry is difficult, obscure and painful to read, we know it is doing us good. It makes no concessions to our intellectual and moral self-esteem.\u201d Hill himself has responded to the oft-leveled charge that his poetry is \u201cdifficult\u201d: \u201cIn my view, difficult poetry is the most democratic, because you are doing your audience the honour of supposing that they are intelligent human beings. So much of the populist poetry of today treats people as if they were fools. And that particular aspect, and the aspect of the forgetting of a tradition, go together.\u201d Hill also has said of difficulty, \u201cWe are difficult. Human beings are difficult. We're difficult to ourselves, we're difficult to each other. And we are mysteries to ourselves, we are mysteries to each other. One encounters in any ordinary day far more real difficulty than one confronts in the most \u2018intellectual\u2019\u00a0piece of work. Why is it believed that poetry, prose, painting, music should be less than we are? Why doesn't music, why does poetry have to address in simplified terms, when if such simplification were applied to a description of our own inner selves we would find it demeaning? I think art has a right\u2014not an obligation\u2014to be difficult if it wishes.\u201d\n\r\nHill\u2019s book\u00a0Tenebrae (1978), \u201cmeaning \u2018darkness\u2019 in Latin,\u201d is concerned with the Good Friday ritual in which candles are extinguished to symbolize the crucifixion of Jesus. One of Hill\u2019s most overtly religious works, the book explores closed forms such as the sonnet while gesturing, in his typically allusive fashion, back to older literature as well. As in his earlier works, remarked Thomas Getz in Modern Poetry Studies, \u201cthere is not the almost physical interaction of subject and object as in Mercian Hymns or some of the earlier social and historical poems. For Hill, faith can only engage the language as that which is longed for but not fully assented to.\u201d Harper\u2019s critic Hayden Carruth simply called Tenebrae \u201cthe best book of devotional poetry in the modern high style since [T.S.] Eliot\u2019s Ash-Wednesday.\u201d Tenebrae was followed by the long poem The Mystery of Charity of Charles Peguy (1983). The poem is based on the real life and times of Charles Peguy, a French poet who underwent a striking conversion from youthful Socialist to Nationalism. According to David Bromwich in the New Republic there is an air of \u201cunfamiliarity\u201d to Hill\u2019s verse. \u201cIt has none of the unction of geniality; does not weaken itself with whimsies, or otherwise truckle for patronage \u2026 [Hill] does not want to be loved for his poems, or search out ways of being likable in his poems.\u201d\n\r\nThroughout the publication of his early work, Hill was teaching in universities and often consumed with the responsibilities of an academic. He began his career as a lecturer at the University of Leeds, and left in 1981 to go to Cambridge University. In 1988, he moved to the United States, taking a position at Boston University. His early work was sparse and emotionally hard-won: it took ten years for his second book to appear. In a profile of the poet in the Guardian, Hill admits, \u201cI believed that I wrote very little because of the encroachments of duty ... but I don\u2019t think it can have been that. I think the encroachments were encroachments of chronic anxiety, which also affected my ability to produce criticism and scholarship. I was simply afraid to put down the next sentence. And since 1992, I\u2019ve been able to write more fluently and easily. Now the malaise has been alleviated the scholarly and critical work and the poems have come more easily.\u201d\n\r\nToward the end of the 1990s, Hill\u00a0cofounded the Editorial Institute with fellow luminary critic and professor Christopher Ricks. They formed the Editorial Institute with the conviction that the textually sound, contextually annotated edition is central to the life of many academic disciplines. Its primary aims are the promotion of critical awareness of editorial issues and practices and the provision of training in editorial methods. Hill served as codirector of the Institute for roughly a decade.\nIt was around this time that Hill\u00a0began to write poetry again at an unprecedented rate. This \u201clate-flowering\u201d produced six volumes in the next ten years: Canaan (1997), The Triumph of Love (1998), Speech! Speech! (2000), The Orchards of Syon (2002), Without Title (2006) and A Treatise of Civil Power (2007). Hill\u2019s Selected Poems was published in 2006. There are those who believe that Hill is the greatest poet writing in English\u2014the heir to Hardy and Eliot\u2014while other critics wrestled with Hill's complexity and obsfucation. According to Robert Potts in the Guardian, \u201cCanaan did displease critics, in England at least. It is a stern book: its apocalyptic Biblical epigraph, its prophetic tone and its breadth of allusion ran very much against the taste of the time. Critics accused Hill of unearned grandiosity, of being deliberately difficult, of being \u2018inaccessible.\u2019\u201d However, not everyone found it such hard going. David Yezzi, in Commonweal, welcomed the collection: \u201cGeoffrey Hill returns with characteristic sobriety to a number of perennial Christian themes: morality, faith, innocence, redemption, and the struggle against evil.\u201d Michael Dirda in the Washington Post Book World found that \u201cthe gnarly density of Hill\u2019s poetry suggests its power. Everything is packed down hard; there\u2019s nothing squishy or sentimental or rhapsodic here,\u201d declaring that \u201cHill\u2019s wracked visions call forth language of great beauty, clever coinages and tormented wit.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nHill\u2019s next books, Speech! Speech!, The Orchards of Syon, Scenes from Comus (2005) and Without Title (2006)\u00a0are as wide-ranging and intricate as any he has written. Speech! Speech! is made of characteristically dense and allusive numbered sections that run the gamut from theology, cultural criticism, autobiography, history and elegy. The Orchards of Syon is set in the landscape of Hill\u2019s childhood. Discussing the book for the Guardian, Hill admitted the work is \u201cconcerned with forms and patterns of reconciliation\u2014not the easiest of states to move into, so there are numerous lapses and relapses throughout the sequence. It is about depth of memory and broken memory, but that could be said of all my poetry. \u2026 The cultivation of depths of memory I see as a civic duty as well as a private burden and consolation.\u201d Without Title, according to William Logan in the New Criterion, is \u201cclearer and less frustrated than his ranting monologues, but its short poems and one long sequence are no less stringent in their demands.\u201d Though echoing critical orthodoxy on Hill\u2019s accessibility, Logan did admit that \u201cmore than any poet alive, Hill has the pulse of English inside him, knowing like a lawyer all its loopholes and vagrancies. The stopped energy of his landscapes has become a valediction, the epitaph of a poet who cannot give up his rages, even as age grinds him down.\u201d\n\r\nHill\u2019s Selected Poems appeared in 2006 to a flood of reviews and commendations. Patrick Kurp, reviewing the volume for the Quarterly Conversation remarked that it was \u201codd to think that Hill, the bane of postmodern poets and critics, may be the most \u2018avant-garde\u2019 poet working today. He pushes the resources of English\u2014etymology, music, multiplicity of meaning, rhetorical devices\u2014further than other writers dare. His poems can be as densely allusive, multi-voiced, polylingual, dissonant, and radically playful as Finnegans Wake. Many poets deploy surface difficulty (Guy Davenport called it \u2018false density\u2019) to mask essential emptiness; when Hill is difficult, he has something to say that cannot be said glibly, and he thus rewards attentive readers.\u201d Hill\u2019s books after his Selected Poems include Oraclau/Oracles (2010), a long sequence meditating on Welsh history, and Clavics (2011) and Odi Barbare (2012), which were both published as installments of \u201cDaybooks.\u201d Both books feature intricate stanzaic patterns that can compress and torque language to extremes. In Tower Poetry, Peter McDonald noted, \u201cWhat can be said of these new books, in a general way, is that in them Hill\u2019s subject matter has become hard to disentangle from matters of poetic voice. \u2026 The voice is marked by insistence, even vehemence, and by compressed, often highly complex, diction (Hill\u2019s own term for his sapphics\u2014\u2018cricked\u2019\u2014catches this discomfort exactly); it can feel as though several shorthands are being employed urgently at the same time, in an exhausting hurry with which it is hard for any reader to keep pace.\u201d\n\r\nHill\u2019s Broken Hierarchies: Poems 1952-2012 collected 60 years of work and ran to almost 1,000 pages. It was published to great acclaim, with many reviewers echoing Nicholas Lezard\u2019s claim, in the Guardian, that \u201cif the phrase \u2018greatest living poet in the English language\u2019 has any meaning, we should use it now.\u201d Yet critical appreciation of Hill\u2019s work remained somewhat divided during his lifetime, even as his status as perhaps the major poet writing in English was never questioned. Hill\u2019s work is often erudite and imbued with scholarship and he is well known as an essayist as well as a poet. In books like The Lords of Limit: Essays on Literature and Ideas (1984), The Enemy\u2019s Country (1995) and Style and Faith (2003), Hill mapped a precise intellectual terrain that considers issues of morality, judgment, literary production and civic engagement. His Collected Critical Writings (2008)\u00a0won the Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism, the highest honor in the genre. In a Times Higher Education review, David Antoine-Williams described Hill\u2019s criticism as \u201cunlike any other.\u201d Antoine-Williams saw Hill\u2019s project one of contextualization and appraisal; Hill\u2019s understanding of literary history and \u201cdepth and breadth of reading\u2026allows Hill to assess not only artistic achievement but also the contribution of the author to an intellectual tradition. ... Taken as a whole, the critical works make up a rich and rigorous philosophy of literature, supremely well nourished by a vast range of poetic, political, metaphysical and theological writings of the past 500 years. This is why Hill may have written the most important collection of poet\u2019s prose to appear in his lifetime. Anyone who cares about literature will want to understand his reasons for caring about it.\u201d\n\r\nHill received numerous awards and honors for his work including the Faber Memorial Prize, the Hawthornden Prize, and the Loines Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2010 Hill was elected to serve as Professor of Poetry at Oxford for five years. He was\u00a0knighted in 2012, a ceremony\u00a0he participated in\u00a0to honor his parents.\u00a0That his critical fame exceeded his popular readership is one of the peculiarities of his genius. Hill\u2019s late transformation has guaranteed he remains an integral part of the contemporary poetry landscape, however. As Adam Kirsch wrote in a review of Without Title,\u201cMr. Hill [is] one of the most fascinating poets at work today\u2014one whose every new book promises a revelation.\u201d \u00a0\nHill died in 2016, leaving behind a massive collection of poetry and criticism dating back to the 1950s. Posthumous works published include The Book of Baruch by the Gnostic Justin (2019).\r\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
