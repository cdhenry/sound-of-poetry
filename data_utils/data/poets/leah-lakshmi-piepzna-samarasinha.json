Seeing stories that look like your own, that you\u2019ve never read written down before, or that are stories you\u2019ve never thought of before that change your whole idea of what is possible, are a big revolutionary deal. \u2026 My poems are my stories of the freedom dreams I want for me and us.\u201d\nPiepzna-Samarasinha\u2019s writing has been anthologized in A Girl\u2019s Guide to Taking Over the World (1997), Colonize This (2002), BITCHfest (2006), Visible: A Femmethology (2009), Persistence: All Ways Butch and Femme (2011), and Octavia\u2019s Brood (2015).
