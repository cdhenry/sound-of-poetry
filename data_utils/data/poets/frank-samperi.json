An autodidact influenced by Thomas Aquinas and Dante Alighieri, Samperi was mentored by poets Louis Zukofsky and Cid Corman.  \u00a0 His poems engage themes of spirituality and transcendence. In a 2008 essay on Samperi\u2019s poetics for Jacket Magazine, J. Townsend observes, \u201cThere is a level of hermetic intimacy within Samperi\u2019s work that creates a fascinating contrast to the vast metaphysical field with which he philosophically engages. The instances of connection are expansive; a sudden sight finds its origin within an overarching spiritual nature.\u201d \u00a0 Samperi published more than 20 poetry collections during his lifetime, including the trilogy The Prefiguration (1971), Quadrifariam (1973), and Lumen Gloriae (1973), as well as The Kingdom (1979) and Alfa ed O (1976). An introduction to Samperi\u2019s work can be found in the posthumously published volume Spiritual Necessity: Selected Poems of Frank Samperi (2004, edited by John Martone).  \u00a0 He died in 1991, following complications from pneumonia at an Arizona veteran\u2019s hospital, at the age of 58. The 120 letters poet and editor Cid Corman wrote to Samperi between 1972 and 1975 are archived in Special Collections at the University of California at Davis.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
