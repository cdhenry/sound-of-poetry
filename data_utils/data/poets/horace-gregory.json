His poetry collections include Chelsea Rooming House (1930); Chorus for Survival (1935); Poems, 1930\u20131940 (1941); Collected Poems (1964), winner of the Bollingen Prize in Poetry; and Another Look (1976). \u00a0 Gregory was educated mainly at home and encouraged to read by his mother and extended family. In 1918 he visited New York and Long Island, but he returned to Wisconsin to attend the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He started to write poetry while in college, moving to New York in 1923 to try to make his living as a copywriter and reviewer. During his years in New York, he married the poet Marya Zaturenska and published his first collection of poems. He published Pilgrim of the Apocalypse, a study of D.H. Lawrence, in 1933 and taught modern poetry and classics at Sarah Lawrence College until 1960. Gregory had a rich correspondence with a number of writers during his lifetime; he met T.S. Eliot and W.B. Yeats, both writers whose work influenced his poetry. \u00a0 Gregory\u2019s poetry is literary and exhibits an awareness of the lives of working people, sometimes taking the form of the elegiac monologue. His interest in spiritualism grew after a visit to England and Dublin, Ireland, where he met Yeats. Poet Richard Eberhart, reviewing Selected Poems of Horace Gregory in the Kenyon Review in 1952, commented on the book\u2019s section \u201cNew Poems: The Garden and the City\u201d: \u201cThe ruthlessness of the city used to be his interest; he used to depict realistic characters and situations within it. Now there is the general serenity, poise and lyrical concern with language.\u201d He added: \u201cGregory is lyrical and straight-forward in these poems,\u201d and identified \u201cclassical feelings bound up with possible American situations.\u201d \u00a0 Horace Gregory translated works of Catullus and Ovid. His nonfiction books include the essay collection The Dying Gladiators and Other Essays (1961), Dorothy Richardson: An Adventure in Self-Discovery (1967), an autobiography called The House on Jefferson Street (1971), the collection Reminiscences (1971), and Collected Essays (1973).\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
