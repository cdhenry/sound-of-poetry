He earned a BA at the University of California-Berkeley and an MFA at New York University and was a 2016-2018 Wallace Stegner Fellow at Stanford University.\nZamora is the author of the poetry collection Unaccompanied (Copper Canyon Press, 2017), and his chapbook\u00a0Nueve A\u00f1os Inmigrantes/Nine Immigrant Years\u00a0won the 2011 Organic Weapon Arts Contest.\u00a0 His poetry was featured in\u00a0Best New Poets 2013 and has appeared in American Poetry Review, Ploughshares, Poetry magazine, the Kenyon Review, the New Republic,\u00a0and elsewhere.\nZamora\u2019s love of poetry was sparked in his last year of high school when visiting poet Rebecca Foust introduced the class to Pablo Neruda\u2019s\u00a0Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair. In his poems, Zamora often engages history, borders, and memory.\u00a0In a 2014 interview with Paula Beete for the\u00a0National Endowment for the Arts Art Works\u00a0Blog, Zamora stated, \u201c[Poetry] matters because there's a history of all the poets who have risked their lives [to write]. I think in the United States we forget that writing and carrying that banner of \u2018being a poet\u2019 is tied into a long history of people that have literally risked [their lives] and died to write those words.\u201d\nZamora's honors include a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship, an Olive B. O\u2019Connor Fellowship in Creative Writing at Colgate University, a CantoMundo fellowship, scholarships to the Bread Loaf Writers\u2019 Conference and Napa Valley Writers\u2019 Conference, a 2016 Barnes and Noble Writer for Writer\u2019s Award, and a Meridian Editors\u2019 Prize. He was also a recipient of a Ruth Lilly and Dorothy Sargent Rosenberg Poetry Fellowship from the Poetry Foundation and a Lannan Foundation Fellowship. He is currently a Radcliffe Fellow at Harvard University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Latin America", "U.S., Western"]}}
