In a 2015 review of The Living Method for A Perimeter, Hajara Quinn observes that \u201cNicholson establishes a metaphysical attraction to a multi-disciplinary poetics,\u201d while on the Public Books blog list of the best poetry books of 2013-2014, poet Geoffrey G. O\u2019Brien chose The Living Method, stating, \u201cthe method is more than meter, it\u2019s meter\u2019s living purpose: Nicholson wields the authority of archival rhythms and the forceful syntax of a logician, but she constantly attaches these certainties to a wildness of premise and a brevity of figure: instead of self, ruled utterance; instead of help, poetry.\u201d\nOn selecting Nicholson\u2019s The Living Method for the Poetry Society of America\u2019s New American Poets prize, Joshua Edwards noted, \u201cThe poems in Nicholson's collection, diverse as they are, are all intensely bold. Sure, they are often aphoristic and declamatory, but this is not the sort of boldness that I mean. I mean a boldness akin to that of Catullus and Dickinson. Like them, Nicholson makes the page into an eye that stares directly.\u201d In an author\u2019s note for her poem \u201cThe Burden,\u201d Nicholson states, \u201cA creative writing teacher once told me that I didn't know how to use\u00a0prepositions. I'm still not sure I've mastered them. Not knowing's not exactly a burden I carry along with or inside or behind me. Instead, I think of it as my refrain.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"]}}
