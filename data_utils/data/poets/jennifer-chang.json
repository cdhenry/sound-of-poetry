She earned her MFA and PhD from the University of Virginia and teaches at George Washington University. She is the author of two books of poetry, The History of Anonymity and Some Say the Lark.\n\r\nChang\u2019s lyrical poems often explore the shifting boundaries between the outer world and the self. Chang\u2019s debut poetry collection, The History of Anonymity (2008), was selected for the Virginia Quarterly Review\u2019s Poetry Series and was a finalist for the Shenandoah/ Glasgow Prize for Emerging Writers. In a review of The History of Anonymity for the Boston Review, critic Kristina Marie Darling observed, \u201cWhile formally diverse, the collection is unified by an ongoing engagement with the natural world, with Chang often presenting forests, rivers, and vast seaside landscapes as loci for her speakers\u2019 search for self-knowledge and authenticity.\u201d Speaking to the \u201cemotional landscapes\u201d of myths and fairy tales that surface occasionally in her poems, Chang stated in a 2008 interview on Critical Mass (the blog of the National Book Critics Circle board of directors): \u201cAs a scholar, I don\u2019t trust autobiography, and as a lyric poet, I don\u2019t trust narrative: both enforce a coherence that reveals more about the writer\u2019s motives at the moment rather than the life or story being told.\u00a0What I do trust is mystery; I trust confusion.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nShe co-chairs the advisory board of Kundiman, a nonprofit organization that supports Asian American literature. She lives in Washington, D.C\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
