He fled to Paris, where he joined the community of Surrealists, though he was never a formal member of the group. Jab\u00e8s lived in France for the rest of his life, and in 1987 received France\u2019s Grand Prix for Poetry. A major voice in postwar French poetry, Jab\u00e8s remains difficult to categorize as a writer. His work is a pastiche of dialogue, aphorism, fragments, poetry, and song; much of his work focuses on the book as a place in which ideas\u2014of exile, God, the self\u2014are approached through question and echo. Though an atheist, his writing refers to Jewish mysticism and the Kabbalah. Speaking with Marcel Cohen, Jab\u00e8s explained, \u201cFor me the words \u2018Jew\u2019 and \u2018God\u2019 are, it is true, metaphors. \u2018God\u2019 is the metaphor for emptiness; \u2018Jew\u2019 stands for the torment of God, of emptiness.\u201d  Jab\u00e8s\u2019s main translator is Rosemarie Waldrop, who has brought more than a dozen of his volumes into English, beginning with The Book of Questions (tr. 1976). In Waldrop\u2019s book on the process of translating Jab\u00e8s,Lavish Absence (2002), she observes, \u201cHis aim is not to invert the traditional hierarchy of sense over sound, but to establish parity between them, or, rather, to establish a dynamic relation between language and thinking, where the words do not express pre-existing thoughts, but where their physical characteristics are allowed to lead to new thoughts.\u201d    In his introduction to From the Book to the Book, a Jab\u00e8s reader, Richard Stamelan notes that Jab\u00e8s \u201creveals the exilic and destructive power of writing, the endless, discontinuous, fragmented, nomadic, always interrogative discourse that forms and unforms, constructs and deconstructs the book.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"]}}
