Anzald\u00faa was a queer Chicana poet, writer, and feminist theorist. Her poems and essays explore the anger and isolation of occupying the margins of culture and collective identity. Anzald\u00faa has been awarded the Lambda Lesbian Small Book Press Award, a Sappho Award of Distinction, and an NEA Fiction Award, among others. She is the author of several books of poetry, non-fiction, and children\u2019s fiction. Her book, Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza (1987) and her essay, \u201cLa Prieta,\u201d are considered to be groundbreaking works in cultural, feminist, and queer theories. With Cherr\u00ede Moraga, Anzald\u00faa co-edited the landmark anthology\u00a0This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color (1981).\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
