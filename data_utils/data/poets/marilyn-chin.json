She earned a BA in Chinese literature from the University of Massachusetts and an MFA from the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. A noted anthologist, translator, and educator, as well as a poet and novelist, Chin\u2019s work distills her experiences as a feminist and Asian American woman. Her poetry is noted for its direct and often confrontational attitude. \u201cThe pains of cultural assimilation infuse her \u2026 poems,\u201d wrote Contemporary Women Poets essayist Anne-Elizabeth Green, noting that in the collections Dwarf Bamboo (1987) and The Phoenix Gone, The Terrace Empty (1994) \u201cChin struggles passionately and eloquently in the pull between the country left behind and America\u2014the troubled landscape that is now home.\u201d Chin is also the author of the poetry collections Rhapsody in Plain Yellow (2002), Hard Love Province (2014), winner of the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, and A Portrait of the Self as Nation: New and Selected Poems (2018). In 2020 she was awarded the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.\nAdrienne Rich said that \u201cMarilyn Chin\u2019s poems excite and incite the imagination through their brilliant cultural interfacings, their theatre of anger, \u2018fierce and tender,\u2019 their compassion, and their high mockery of wit. Reading her, our sense of the possibilities of poetry is opened further, and we feel again what an active, powerful art it can be.\u201d Reviewing Chin's book The Phoenix Gone in The Progressive, Matthew Rothschild commented that Chin \u201chas a voice all her own\u2014witty, epigraphic, idiomatic, elegiac, earthy\u2026 . She covers the canvas of cultural assimilation with an intensely personal brush.\u201d The poet\u2019s intensity was also noted by a Publishers Weekly critic, who said of the same volume that Chin\u2019s \u201cstalwart declaration\u201d provides her poetry with a \u201cgrounded force, line to line; and her imagery, simple and spare, lifts up those same lines.\u201d Widely anthologized, Chin's work has been featured in\u00a0The Norton Anthology of Literature by Women, The Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry, The Penguin Anthology of 20th Century Poetry, The Best American Poetry, and on Bill Moyers\u2019s PBS series The Language of Life.\n\r\nIn Rhapsody in Plain Yellow, Chin continues to address her Asian-American identity, acknowledging that \u201cthere\u2019s no life on earth without pain.\u201d Booklist contributor Donna Seaman described the tone of the collection: \u201cChin paces the line demarcated by the words Chinese American like a caged tiger, fury just barely held in check.\u201d Rhapsody in Plain Yellow meditates on the struggle between the world of her parents and grandparents and Chin\u2019s reality as a female poet in the United States; formally, the book draws inspiration from traditional Chinese music and the American blues. Carol Muske-Dukes, writing in the Los Angeles Times, characterized Rhapsody in Plain Yellow as a collection \u201cambitious in style and syncopation.\u201d\n\r\nOf her own poetry, Chin explained in Contemporary Women Poets: \u201cI believe that my work is daring, both technically and thematically. \u2026 My work is steeped with the themes and travails of exile, loss and assimilation. What is the loss of country if it were not the loss of self?\u201d Similar themes inform Chin\u2019s 2009 novel, Revenge of the Mooncake Vixen, a satirical take on both the coming-of-age and immigrant assimilation novels. Billed as both a \u201cnovel\u201d and \u201cmanifesto in 41 tales,\u201d Marilyn Chin described her book in an interview with the Boston Globe as \u201can immigrant tale with surreal things zigzagging through it. Immigrant novels are traditionally straightforward, linear; there\u2019s not much play with realism and naturalism. I\u2019m trying to contest that.\u201d The novel was critically praised for its exuberance and tart playfulness. A reviewer for Time Out Hong Kong noted thematic similarities between Chin and other novelists of the Asian American experience like Amy Tan, adding \u201cbut Chin\u2019s refreshing irreverence makes her book happily hard to categorize. Ultimately, the \u2018manifesto\u2019 promised by its subtitle is found not in its narrative, but in its inventiveness and pluck.\u201d\nIn addition to writing poetry and fiction, Chin has translated poetry by various Asian writers, notably by the modern Chinese poet Ai Qing, the Vietnamese poet Ho Xuan Huong, and co-translated poems by the Japanese poet Gozo Yoshimasu.  She has edited ground-breaking anthologies of Asian-American writing like Dissident Song (1991) and Asian American Poetry: The Next Generation (2004). \nShe has won numerous awards, including the Anisfield Wolf Book Award, the United States Artist Foundation Award, the PEN/Josephine Miles Award, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature, and five Pushcart Prizes. She has also received a Stegner Fellowship, a Fulbright Fellowship to Taiwan, two NEA fellowships, a Radcliffe Institute Fellowship at Harvard, a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship, a Lannan residency, and others. In 2017, she was honored by the Asian Pacific Islander Caucus and the California Assembly for her activism and excellence in education.\nChin codirected the MFA program at San Diego State University, where she is professor emerita in the departments of English and Comparative Literature. She has read and taught workshops all over the world, and she has recently been guest poet at universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong, Manchester, Sydney, Berlin, and elsewhere. In 2018 Chin was elected a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
