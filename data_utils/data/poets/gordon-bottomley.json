At 18, he contracted tuberculosis, recurrences of which limited his ability to work. From his home, he carried out a rich creative life and maintained many literary correspondences.  \u00a0 Engaged with the revival of verse drama, Bottomley composed poetry and plays exploring human consciousness, often grounded in stark realism. Inspired by Japanese Noh theater, he often set his plays in smaller spaces with minimal scenery. \u201cThe poetic drama is, indeed, not so much a representation of a theme as a meditation upon it or a distillation from it; its business is far less the simulation of life than the evocation and isolation for our delight of the elements of beauty and spiritual illumination in the perhaps terrible and always serious theme chosen,\u201d Bottomley states in his essay \u201cPoetry and the Contemporary Theatre,\u201d published in Essays and Studies by Members of the English Association (1934). \u00a0 His poetry collections include The Mickle Drede and Other Voices (1896), Poems of Thirty Years (1925), and Poems and Plays (1953). His plays include King Lear\u2019s Wife (1915) and Gruach (1921). His work was also included in Georgian Poetry, Edward Marsh\u2019s anthology series, and in The New Poetry: An Anthology (1917, edited by Harriet Monroe and Alice Corbin Henderson). \u00a0 Bottomley frequently corresponded with Edward Thomas and the artist Paul Nash, who also drew stage sets for some of Bottomley\u2019s plays. These two correspondences are collected in Edward Thomas\u2019s Letters from Edward Thomas to Gordon Bottomley (1968, edited by R. George Thomas) and Poet and Painter: Being the Correspondence Between Gordon Bottomley and Paul Nash 1910\u20131946 (1955, edited by Claude Colleer Abbott and Anthony Bertram, reissued and edited by Andrew Causey in 1990 with a second edition in 2007). \u00a0 President of the Scottish Community Drama Association and vice president of the British Drama League, Bottomley received several honorary degrees, including a D.Litt. from Durham University. Selections of his papers are archived in the libraries of the University of Glasgow and Durham University.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Georgian"]}}
