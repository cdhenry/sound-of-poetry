Her collections of poetry include Just West of Now (1992), Labor Songs (1999), Parents from a Different Alphabet (2008), and American Amnesiac (2013), which was a finalist for the 2014 Housatonic Book Award and\u00a0long-listed for a National Book Award.\u00a0Her poems have appeared in numerous literary journals, including Women\u2019s Studies Quarterly, Terrain.org, OccuPoetry, and the Los Angeles Review. Her work has also been anthologized widely in such places as New Poets of the American West, Mamas and Papas: On the Sublime and Heartbreaking Art of Parenting, Classifieds: An Anthology of Prose Poems, and The Glenn Gould Anthology.\u00a0\u00a0\n\r\nShe has been awarded three fellowships in literature from the Idaho Commission on the Arts, and\u00a0in 2013\u00a0she was named poet laureate of Boise, Idaho, as well as the Idaho Writer in Residence. In an interview with the Idaho Statesman, she noted Idaho\u2019s influence on her work: \u201cI like the leveling influence of living here. If you try to show people your importance, they don't buy it. That democratizing effect does influence my poetry. I find it affords me an expansiveness in terms of voice that might not be there if I were in a different landscape.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nRaptosh is the\u00a0Eyck-Berringer Endowed Chair in English at The College of Idaho\u00a0and directs the program in criminal justice and prison studies.\u00a0A highly active ambassador for poetry, she has conducted writing workshops, given readings, and lectured on poetry in a variety of locations ranging from university auditoriums to maximum security prisons, school buses to riverbanks.
