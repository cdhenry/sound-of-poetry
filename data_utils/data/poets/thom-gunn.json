Gunn\u2019s early life was peripatetic; after his parents\u2019 divorce, he traveled with his father to various assignments and attended a number of different schools. His mother committed suicide when Gunn was fifteen. In an interview with the Paris Review Gunn spoke about the effect of his mother\u2019s death: \u201cI was devastated for about four years. I very much retired into myself. I read an enormous number of Victorian novels and eighteenth-century ones too. I read them very much as an escape\u2026 I gradually came out of it, but it was a difficult four years or so. I don\u2019t think I knew how difficult they were at the time\u2014luckily\u2014so maybe originally I wrote as a way of getting out of that, but I can\u2019t tell.\u201d After completing his initial schooling, he served in the British Army for two years and then moved to Paris for six months, where he read Proust and wrote fiction. Gunn was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge during the heyday of F.R. Leavis. His first collection of poetry, Fighting Terms (1954) was published the year after he graduated. Gunn\u2019s early poetry\u2014with its unembarrassed presentations of love as interpersonal combat and its focus on the upheavals of war and the freedom of life on the road\u2014was widely praised.\r\n\u00a0\r\nGunn left England shortly after his first book. With his partner, Michael Kitay, who he met at Cambridge, Gunn moved to California to study poetry with Yvor Winters. He spent the rest of his life in San Francisco with Kitay. Gradually, he began reading the poetry of William Carlos Williams, Gary Snyder, and Robert Duncan, influences that would shape his poetry. Perhaps because of his dual, and dueling, allegiances, Gunn\u2019s work is often remarked on as hybrid: as an English poet who was also a long-time resident of California, his poems combine a respect for traditional poetic forms with an interest in popular topics, such as the Hell\u2019s Angels, LSD, and queer culture. While Gunn wrote most of his early verses in iambic pentameter\u2014a phase when his ambition was \u201cto be the John Donne of the twentieth century\u201d\u2014his later works assume a variety of forms, including syllabic stanzas and free verse. The course of Gunn\u2019s development is recorded in Selected Poems 1950-1975 (1979), in which \u201cthe language begins as English and progresses toward American,\u201d according to Nation reviewer Donald Hall.\r\n\u00a0\r\nGunn\u2019s early collections of poetry include The Sense of Movement (1957) and My Sad Captains (1961), a book divided into halves. The first half included poems written in the heroic verse of his first two books, and the second began to experiment with syllabic verse. The book proved a watershed, and Gunn\u2019s collections after all find him moving between high and low, old and new styles. Books such as Touch (1967), Moly (1971), Jack Straw\u2019s Castle (1976), and The Passages of Joy (1982) show Gunn\u2019s fusion of \u201cmodern\u201d and \u201ctraditional\u201d elements. Writing in the New York Times Book Review, M. L. Rosenthal praised Selected Poems 1950-1975 (1979), noting that \u201cGunn has developed his craft so that by now even his freest compositions have a disciplined music.\u201d Echoing this sentiment, New York Review of Books critic Stephen Spender suggested that the contradiction between the \u201cconventional form\u201d of Gunn\u2019s poems and their \u201coften Californian \u2018with it\u2019 subject matter\u201d is what distinguishes his work. Frank representations of violence, sex, and the life of the counterculture based in San Francisco connect with \u201cyesterday and tomorrow\u201d in Gunn\u2019s art, remarked Charles Champlin in an article for the Los Angeles Times Book Review. \u201cIt is,\u201d Spender elaborated, \u201cas though A. E. Housman were dealing with the subject matter of Howl, or Tennyson were on the side of the Lotus Eaters.\u201d Gunn himself once summed up his peculiar poetic lineage: \u201cI have sometimes said to myself, I am the only person in the world ever to have dedicated poems to both Winters and Duncan. They hated each other. They didn\u2019t meet but they hated each other.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhen the 1980s brought the AIDS epidemic to the gay community, Gunn lost many of his friends to the disease. His grief was, according to many critics, profoundly described in The Man with Night Sweats (1992). While the verses often describe heartbreaking personal loss, the poems are never self-indulgent and \u201cnever moralistic,\u201d asserted David Ferry in the Boston Review. Nation critic Robert Pinsky similarly wrote that, \u201ceven when it has the power to make a reader weep, the writing itself is not dabbing righteously at its eyes. Celebrated poems like \u2018Lament,\u2019 \u2018In Time of Plague\u2019 and \u2018Courtesies of the Interregnum\u2019 have so much dignity along with their force that they do credit to the readers who have made them something like classics already.\u201d \u201cHere is a poet without vanity,\u201d commented Henri Cole in another Nation review, \u201c\u2014the aberration afflicting so many of us\u2014whose poems consider instead those lives that, like branches, crisscross his own. \u2018Writing poetry has in fact become a certain stage in my coping with the world,\u2019 he tells us, \u2018or in the way I try to understand what happens to me and inside me. Perhaps I could say that my poetry is an attempt to grasp, with grasp meaning both to take hold of in a first bid at possession, and also to understand.\u2019\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nGunn\u2019s later poems increasingly addressed mortality. Love poems took on a sense of irony, as in Boss Cupid (2000). Gunn often wryly commented on how the god of love often aims his arrows at arbitrary targets, thus causing people to fall in love with unsuitable partners. \u201cIn contrast to\u2026 The Man with Night Sweats,\u201d observed Phoebe Pettingell in New Leader, \u201cwhich bleakly elegized the AIDS epidemic, Boss Cupid usually manages a laugh in the face of adversity. Gunn uses humor the way he uses rhyme and meter: to give form to fear and emptiness so dreadful that they threaten to overwhelm thought and emotion.\u201d Neither British nor American, Gunn resolutely evaded easy classification throughout his career as a poet. \u201cThe point is not legalities of citizenship (Gunn remains a resident alien, fitting a poet both domestic and estranged),\u201d Hall observed in the Los Angeles Times Book Review, \u201cbut that he may not be labeled by nationality or anything else. His identity is his resistance to the limitations of identity. He belongs to uncertainty, exploration, movement and ongoingness\u2026 Here is the man without conventional supports who refuses title and easy chair, political party and national identity.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nGunn taught at the University of California-Berkeley off and on from 1958 to 1999. His many honors and awards included the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize, the Levinson Prize, the W.H. Smith Award, the Sara Teasdale Prize, the Forward Prize, the Rockefeller Award and the Lila Wallace-Reader\u2019s Digest Award. He received fellowships from the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the MacArthur Foundation. Gunn died of heart failure at his home in San Francisco in 2004.\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
