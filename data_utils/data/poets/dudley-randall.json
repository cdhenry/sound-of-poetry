A bright student, Randall graduated early. After working in Ford\u2019s River Rouge foundry for five years and serving in the South Pacific during World War II, he earned a BA in English from Wayne University (now Wayne State University) and a MA in library science from the University of Michigan. Randall, who became the reference librarian for Wayne County, was fluent in Russian; visited Europe, Africa, and Russia; and later translated many Russian poems into English.\n\r\nThe influence of Dudley Randall, founder of Broadside Press and Detroit\u2019s first poet laureate, \u201chas been one of the strongest\u2014some say the strongest\u2014in the black poetry movement of the last 15 years,\u201d\u00a0argued\u00a0Suzanne Dolezal in Detroit\u00a0magazine. \u201cAs publisher of Detroit\u2019s Broadside Press between 1965 and 1977, Randall provided a forum for just about every major black poet to come along during those years. And dozens of anthologies include his own rapid, emotional lyrics about Detroit\u2019s bag ladies, lonely old drunks, strapping foundry workers and young women with glistening, corn-rowed hair,\u201d she continued.\u00a0\u201cBeyond Randall\u2019s contributions as a poet, his roles as editor and publisher have proven invaluable to the Afro-American community,\u201d R. Baxter Miller wrote in\u00a0the\u00a0Dictionary of Literary Biography.\n\r\nRandall\u2019s first books, however, did not display his range, Miller indicates.\u00a0Poem Counterpoem,\u00a0a unique volume in which \u201cten poems each by [Margaret] Danner and Randall. \u2026 are alternated to form a kind of double commentary on the subjects they address in common,\u201d contains \u201conly the verses appropriately matched with Danner\u2019s,\u201d the essayist relates; and while\u00a0Cities Burning,\u00a0Randall\u2019s second opus, presents the spirit of the poet\u2019s urban environment and the politics of his times, it gathers only those poems that treat \u201cthe theme of a disintegrating era.\u201d\n\r\nBut the third and more inclusive collection\u00a0More to Remember: Poems of Four Decades \u201cdisplays [Randall\u2019s] artistic breadth\u201d in poems that address universal themes and explore \u201ccontradictions in human psychology and the black arts movement,\u201d observes Miller. Miller also sees \u201cRandall\u2019s aesthetic theory\u201d in poems that depict \u201cthe artist as a modifier of both literary tradition and classical form.\u201d Randall defines this aesthetic himself in\u00a0Negro Digest: \u201cPrecision and accuracy are necessary for both white and black writers. \u2026 \u2018A black aesthetic\u2019 should not be an excuse for sloppy writing.\u201d He believes that for writers who adhere to the \u201cblack aesthetic\u201d there is a future, \u201cas long as their rejection of \u2018white standards\u2019 rejects only what is false. \u2026 How else can a black writer write than out of his black experience? Yet what we tend to overlook is that our common humanity makes it possible to write a love poem, for instance, without a word of race, or to write a nationalistic poem that will be valid for all humanity.\u201d\nLater collections of Randall\u2019s poems highlight\u00a0his careful craftsmanship. Reviewing\u00a0After the Killing\u00a0(1973),\u00a0Frank Marshall Davis\u00a0declares, \u201cDudley Randall again offers visual proof of why he should be ranked in the front echelon of Black poets.\u201d When the poet evades \u201ccliches and hackneyed rhymes, he excels at his craft,\u201d says Miller, who also believes that verses in\u00a0A Litany of Friends: New and Selected Poems\u00a0(1981) \u201cdemonstrate Randall\u2019s technical skill.\u201d Brief notices about Randall\u2019s books in library trade journals are generally complimentary.\n\r\nReviewers recognize Randall\u2019s work as a bridge between earlier black writers and the Black Arts movement. \u201cExploring racial and historical themes, introspective and self-critical, his work combines ideas and forms from Western traditional poetry as well as from the Harlem Renaissance movement,\u201d Miller notes. Writing in the\u00a0Negro Digest\u00a0in 1969, Ron Welburn concurs: \u201c[Randall\u2019s] is a keen functional awareness of what black poetry has been and remains, and there is no hint of an alienation from the ethos being developed by the new stylists.\u201d Welburn\u2019s review foresaw that younger poets would be somewhat influenced by Randall\u2019s voice and perhaps more potently by his example: \u201che is contributing something to black literature that has a lasting value.\u201d\nBroadside Press\u2014Randall\u2019s other contribution to black poetry in America\u2014began in 1963. Randall had composed the poem \u201cBallad of Birmingham\u201d after a bomb exploded in an Alabama church, killing four children. \u201cFolk singer Jerry Moore of New York had it set to music, and I wanted to protect the rights to the poem by getting it copyrighted,\u201d the publisher recalls in\u00a0Broadside Memories: Poets I Have Known.\u00a0Leaflets, he learned, could be copyrighted, so he published the poem as a broadside, a single sheet of paper that could be printed and sold for a minimal price. Randall\u2019s \u201cDressed All in Pink,\u201d composed after John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination, also recorded by Moore, became number two of the Broadside series, which was to include close to 100 titles by 1982.\n\r\nRandall became a book publisher when poets at a Fisk University conference nominated him to collect and publish \u201cthe many poems being written about the slain black leader\u201d Malcolm X, reports Dolezal. The printing was delayed so that\u00a0For Malcolm: Poems on the Life and Death of Malcolm X\u00a0was not the first Broadside book published, but when it came out in 1967, it was a success. By that time aware that major publishers were seldom accepting works by young black poets, Randall \u201cbecame dedicated to giving the emerging black poetry the forum it needed,\u201d Dolezal notes. Indeed, Randall\u2019s encouragement was essential to the writing careers of several black poets.\u00a0Etheridge Knight, for example, was in prison when he contributed three poems to the Broadside anthology\u00a0For Malcolm,\u00a0and Randall\u2019s visits \u201cconvinced a hesitant Knight of his talent,\u201d Dolezal reports. Randall published first books for Knight and for\u00a0Haki R. Madhubuti\u00a0(formerly Don L. Lee), two poets who now enjoy international acclaim. Altogether, the press produced nearly 60 volumes of poetry and criticism under Randall\u2019s tenure, all showcasing black writers, who rewarded his dedication by remaining loyal to Broadside even when larger publishing houses with generous promotion budgets beckoned.\u00a0Gwendolyn Brooks\u00a0insisted that Randall, not Harper & Row, would publish her autobiography;\u00a0Sonia Sanchez\u00a0preferred Broadside to the Third World Press, the small press founded by Madhubuti. Poet\u00a0Nikki Giovanni\u00a0explained to Dolezal, \u201cBroadside was neither mother nor father of the poetry movement, but it was certainly midwife. Dudley understood the thrust of the movement, which was essentially vernacular. He \u2026 allowed his poets to find their own voices. That was the charm of Broadside.\u201d\n\r\nBy 1977, Randall\u2019s determination to supply low-priced books even to stores already in debt to him brought the small press, also deeply in debt, to the crisis point. The Alexander Crummell Memorial Center, a church in Highland Park, Michigan, bought the press, retaining Randall as its consultant. In the early 80s, ownership returned to Randall, who sold it to poet Hilda Vest and her husband in 1985. In 2015, Broadside Press merged with Lotus Press, operated by Detroit poet Naomi Long Madgett. It exists today under the name Broadside Lotus Press. \u201cRandall\u2019s achievement remains intact,\u201d Dolezal wrote.\nRandall described those achievements in his 1975 book \u201cBroadside Memories,\u201d reported Morgan Jerkins in the New York Times. \u201cMy strongest motivations,\u201d Randall wrote, \u201chave been to get good black poets published, to produce beautiful books, help create and define the soul of black folk, and to know the joy of discovering new poets.\u201d\n\r\nRandall died in 2000. In May 2001, the University of Detroit Mercy's\u00a0McNichols Campus Library\u00a0was designated a national Literary Landmark by the Friends of Libraries USA (now the\u00a0Association of Library Trustees, Advocates, Friends and Foundations) and UDM's\u00a0Dudley Randall Center for Print Culture\u00a0was named in his honor. The Dudley Randall Poetry Prize is awarded to a University of Detroit Mercy student each year.\n", "attrs": {}}
