He is a member of the Chicano multimedia arts collective, ASCO (Spanish for \u201cnausea\u201d). Started in Los Angeles\u00a0in the 1970s, ASCO originally consisted of Gronk, Willie Herr\u00f3n, Patssi Valdez, and Harry Gamboa Jr.; their art pushed genre boundaries, combining performance, visual arts, and poetry. Gronk is well known for his murals, most of which are site-specific and temporary, with the purpose of being eventually whitewashed. He has exhibited widely, and his\u00a0work is collected\u00a0by many museums, including the Smithsonian and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
