Her interests revolve around questions of transformation, language, and ecology. Concerned with politics without being overtly political, Spahr\u2019s work crosses a variety of American landscapes, from the disappearing beaches of Hawaii to the small town of her Appalachian childhood. Her books of criticism and theory include Du Bois\u2019s Telegram: Literary Resistance and State Containment (2018) and Everybody\u2019s Autonomy: Connective Reading and Collective Identity (2001).\nSpahr\u2019s own poems have focused on reading as a \u201ccommunal, democratic, and open process.\u201d Her many books of poetry include That Winter the Wolf Came (2015); Well Then There Now (2011); The Transformation (2007); This Connection of Everyone with Lungs (2005); Things of Each Possible Relation Hashing Against One Another (2003); Fuck You-Aloha-I Love You (2001); Response (1996), which won a National Poetry Series Award; Spiderwasp or Literary Criticism (1998); and Nuclear (1994).\nSpahr has also edited several volumes of essays and poetry, including Writing from the New Coast: Technique (1993); A Poetics of Criticism (1994); American Women Poets in the 21st Century: Where Lyric Meets Language (2002), with Claudia Rankine; and Poetry and Pedagogy: the Challenge of the Contemporary (2006).
