In a 2013 interview with Erika L. Sanchez for NBCLatino, Martinez stated, \u201cYou know in any good piece of art when their truth is poking through. I know those moments when I write. I think, \u201cThis is true, this hurts, and this is not ok.\u201d I indict myself in so many poems. I think that to a certain extent, you have to be unafraid to make a fool of yourself.\u201d He is the author of the poetry collections Hustle (2014) and Post-Traumatic Hood Disorder (2018). A CantoMundo Fellow, he has served as an editor for Gulf Coast and has contributed to the Voz Alta Project in Barrio Logan.\n\r\nMartinez lives in Brooklyn.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
