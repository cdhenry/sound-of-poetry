He attended the University of Chicago, New York University, and Columbia University, but did not complete a degree. The son of the writer William Saroyan, Aram made his debut as a writer with six poems and a review of\u00a0Robert Creeley's novel\u00a0The Island\u00a0in the April 1964 issue of\u00a0Poetry\u00a0magazine. He became famous for his one-word or \u201cminimal\u201d poems, a form he developed during the early and mid-1960s, and which is often linked to Concrete poetry. Saroyan is also frequently linked to Second Generation New York School Poets and conceptual art. Saroyan\u2019s first books in this mode were\u00a0Aram Saroyan\u00a0(1968) and\u00a0Pages\u00a0(1969). Perhaps the most famous of Saroyan\u2019s one-word poems is \u201clighght.\u201d George Plimpton included it in\u00a0The American Literary Anthology,\u00a0an anthology paid for by the newly established National Endowment for the Arts. The poem became the center of a heated debate over government funding for the arts. Saroyan himself has said that, \u201capparently the crux of the poem is to try and make the ineffable, which is light\u2014which we only know about because it illuminates something else\u2014into a\u00a0thing. An extra \u2018gh\u2019 does it \u2026 It\u2019s sculptural on that level.\u201d Saroyan\u2019s\u00a0Complete Minimal Poems\u00a0(2007) won the William Carlos Williams Award and was republished in 2014. Other collections of Saroyan\u2019s poetry include\u00a0Day and Night: Bolinas Poems\u00a0(1999).\nSaroyan has published numerous volumes of prose, including collections of essays and books of fiction such as\u00a0Still Night in L.A.

His memoirs include\u00a0Friends in the World: The Education of a Writer\u00a0(1992),\u00a0Last Rites\u00a0(1982), about the death of his father, and the autobiographical novel The\u00a0Street\u00a0(1974). He has written about the literary and artistic milieu in\u00a0Genesis Angels: The Saga of Lew Welch and the Beat Generation\u00a0(1980) and\u00a0Trio: Oona Chaplin Carol Matthau and Gloria Vanderbilt: Portrait of an Intimate Friendship\u00a0(1985) and his true-crime book\u00a0Rancho Mirage: An American Tragedy of Madness, Manners, and Murder\u00a0(1993) was a Literary Guild selection.
