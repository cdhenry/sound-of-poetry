She is the author of the poetry collections The Book of Hulga (2016), which won the Felix Pollak Prize, and\u00a0The Alphabet Conspiracy (2011), which won the 2012 Drake Emerging Writers Award. \u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nInformed by her work for the Dictionary of American Regional English, Reese\u2019s poems move both within and against the constraints of the English language. In a 2011 NewPages review, Alissa Fleck observed, \u201cRita Mae Reese\u2019s The Alphabet Conspiracy is a book replete with anecdotes and snapshots of memory, ranging in subject matter from the religious to the informatively historical to the contemporary, which thoroughly [explores] both the whimsy and restrictions of language.\u201d In an online statement for the literary journal Anti-, Reese stated, \u201cI'm against poems that aren't against anything. Poems that only have one mind (or fewer). Poems that go in one direction only. I'm even more against poems that go very slowly in one direction. I'm against poetry that's never smoked, can't take a joke and can't remember my name.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nReese\u2019s poetry has been nominated for a Pushcart Prize, and work of hers is featured in Robert Olen Butler\u2019s From Where You Dream: The Process of Writing Fiction (2005) and Poetry From Sojourner: A Feminist Anthology (2004). Her honors include a Rona Jaffe Foundation Writers\u2019 Award, the Paumanok Poetry Award, a Wallace Stegner Fellowship from Stanford University, and a Discovery/the Nation award.\r\n\u00a0\r\nReese lives in Madison, Wisconsin.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
