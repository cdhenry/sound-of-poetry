He earned his BA in Chinese studies at the University of Hawai\u02bbi. Before his tragic death, Westlake produced an innovative body of work: he translated Taoist classical literature and Japanese haiku and interwove perspectives from his Hawaiian heritage into his writing and art. The only collection of his poems available during his lifetime was a 32-page, limited edition chapbook independently published by a small press. The posthumous collection Westlake: Poems by Wayne Kaumualii Westlake (1947\u20131984), edited by Mei-Li M. Siy and Richard Hamasaki (University of Hawai\u02bbi Press, 2009), includes nearly 200 poems, many previously unpublished.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Pacific Islands"]}}
