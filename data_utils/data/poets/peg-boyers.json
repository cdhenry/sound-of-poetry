She earned her BA from Skidmore College. Her collections of poetry are Hard Bread (2002),\u00a0Honey with Tobacco (2007), and To Forget Venice (2014). Hard Bread contains a series of poems written in the voice of Natalia Ginzburg (1916\u20131991), an Italian writer, editor, and mother who witnessed World War II. Boyers carefully reconstructed Ginzburg\u2019s experiences by illuminating the historical details of her life. Steven Cramer called the narrative \u201ca great achievement of voice\u201d in Poetry.\u00a0\n\r\nA lecturer in the English Department at Skidmore College and adjunct professor at Columbia University, Boyers is the executive editor of Salmagundi.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
