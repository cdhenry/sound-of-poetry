I\u2019m not easily at home in either \u2018world.\u2019 So, I\u2019m the kind of poet who engages in creating a world.\u201d His art draws on multiple mediums to explore common principles within language, sculpture, sound, installation, and performance. Quasha\u2019s most recent projects include \u201cart is,\u201d recordings of more than 800 artists, poets, and composers discussing their understanding of art. His sculptures, in which he uses stones and gravity, were documented and published in Axial Stones: An Art of Precarious Balance (2006). His work has been exhibited internationally in venues such as White Box, the Samuel Dorsky Museum, and multiple biennials.\n\r\nQuasha\u2019s video installation/single-channel work art is (Speaking Portraits) asks \u00a0over 1,000 artists, poets, and composers (from 11 countries and 21 languages) what in their view art is. This ongoing work (art is/music is/poetry is) has been exhibited at the Snite Museum of Art (University of Notre Dame), at White Box in Chelsea, at the Samuel Dorsky Museum (SUNY New Paltz), and in several other countries, including France and India. Further extensions of this work in speaking portraiture include myth is and peace is.
