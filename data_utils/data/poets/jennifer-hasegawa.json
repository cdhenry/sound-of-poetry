Her debut poetry collection La Chica\u2019s Field Guide to Banzai Living (2020) received the San Francisco Foundation\u2019s Joseph Henry Jackson Literary Award. In a review of this book for his blog, Rob McLennan writes, \u201cHasegawa\u2019s lyrics write slant on home and displacement, from the traveller to the immigrant to the notion of the alien (both immigrant and extraterrestrial). \u2026 This is an impressive debut, and Hasegawa\u2019s poems are remarkably vibrant, as the performance elements resound from the page with a force enough to echo, refusing to lay flat but to spark and sparkle with energy.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
