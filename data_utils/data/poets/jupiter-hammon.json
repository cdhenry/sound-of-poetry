After Lloyd\u2019s death, he lived with his son, Joseph Lloyd.  \u00a0 Hammon\u2019s first work, the broadside An Evening Thought (also referred to as \u201cAn Evening Prayer\u201d and \u201cAn Evening\u2019s Thought: Salvation by Christ, with Penitential Cries\u201d), was published in 1760. Considered a religious poet, Hammon also served as a preacher to the other enslaved members of the Lloyd estate. He was a prominent member of the African American community, and in 1787 made a speech to the African Society of New York City titled \u201cAn Address to the Negroes in the State of New York.\u201d  \u00a0 Jupiter Hammon was buried in an unmarked grave on the Lloyd estate.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
