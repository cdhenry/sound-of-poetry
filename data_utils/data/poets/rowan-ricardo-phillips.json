He is the author of the poetry collections The Ground (2012) and Heaven (2015), which was a finalist for the National Book Award. His poems engage the acts of post-9/11 memory and ruin, lingering in interrupted or merged landscapes of art, rhetoric, and marginalia. \u201cIts title may suggest stability, but the ground Phillips treads is a middle ground\u2014between spirit and flesh, heaven and earth, here and gone. His images are evanescent, twilit, smoke-obscured,\u201d observed poet Eric McHenry in a New York Times review of The Ground, noting that \u201cPhillips\u2019s forms, too, are as much what they aren\u2019t as what they are: made-over sonnets, pseudo-Spenserian stanzas, unrhymed tercets loosely translated from the Purgatorio (so loosely that they\u2019re now about Bob Marley).\u201d In an interview for The Rumpus, Phillips discussed the connection he finds between poem-making and world-making, stating, \u201cPoets, especially, as they\u2019re in search of a sustainable way of creating with their language, absolutely must find a way of unraveling the world and making it again. Heraclitus, I believe, said that geography is fate. That, then, is what tethers us to the world. The rest is pulling on that tether.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn addition to his collections of poetry, Phillips is author of the critical volume When Blackness Rhymes with Blackness (2010). He translated Salvador Espriu\u2019s story collection Ariadne in the Grotesque Labyrinth (2012). Phillips received a 2013 Whiting Writers\u2019 Award and has also received the PEN/Joyce Osterweil Award, the Great Lakes Colleges Association New Writers Award for Poetry, and a Guggenheim Foundation fellowship. A contributing writer at Artforum, he has taught at Columbia University, Harvard, Princeton, and at SUNY-Stony Brook, where he\u2019s served as director of the Poetry Center. Phillips lives in New York and Barcelona.\n", "attrs": {}}
