She is the author of The Last Skin\u00a0(2010), winner of the best poetry award from the\u00a0Texas Institute of Letters;\u00a0One Hidden Stuff (2006);\u00a0and\u00a0Bite Every Sorrow (1998), which was selected by C.K. Williams for the Walt Whitman Award.\u00a0Of Bite Every Sorrow, C.K. Williams wrote,\u00a0\u201cthe book is a demonstration of what might be called a morality of inclusiveness, a Whitmanesque commitment to the wisdom of the individual case rather than the general type. And along with so much rich soul-work, there is a remarkable poetic skill. Ras structures poems with a zaniness and an unpredictable cunning, and her verbal expertise and lucidity are as bright and surprising as her knowledge of the world is profound.\u201d\n\r\nRas\u00a0is the recipient of numerous awards including the Kate Tufts Discovery Award and a Guggenheim fellowship.\u00a0She has taught at the Warren Wilson MFA Program for Writers. Currently she directs the Trinity University Press in San Antonio, Texas.\n", "attrs": {}}
