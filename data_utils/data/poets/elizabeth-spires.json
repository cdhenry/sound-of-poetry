She lives in Baltimore, Maryland and teaches at Goucher College. Her poetry collections include A Memory of the Future (2018), The Wave-Maker\u00a0(2008),\u00a0Now the Green Blade Rises\u00a0(2004),\u00a0Swan\u2019s Island\u00a0(1997), and\u00a0Worldling\u00a0(1995), winner of the 1996 Whiting Writers\u2019 Award. Spires has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Witter Bynner Award, and the Amy Lowell Travelling Poetry Scholarship.\nSpires has cited John Donne,\u00a0George Herbert,\u00a0Robert Frost,\u00a0John Berryman,\u00a0Robert Lowell,\u00a0Elizabeth Bishop,\u00a0Josephine Jacobsen, and\u00a0A.R. Ammons as influences. Critics praise her collection Worldling (1995) for its use of quotidian moments to explore universal themes such as happiness, mortality, travel, parent-child bonding, and life stages. In the\u00a0Dictionary of Literary Biography, William V. Davis observed that Spires \u201cweaves words and images together into a kind of fugue of meaning and emotion.\u201d In\u00a0Poetry,\u00a0John Taylor praised the author for her \u201csubtle, crystal-clear poetry \u2026 that is constantly philosophically suggestive, while never becoming pretentious or belaboring.\u201d Taylor wrote that Spires\u2019s \u201cperceptions of the unfathomable mysteries of being have been intensified by mothering. \u2026 Bearing and raising a child have given Spires a more concrete, moving, understanding of what Saint Augustine termed \u2018the presence of things past and the presence of things future.\u2019\u201d He added, \u201cThis is important poetry because it grapples sincerely with the possibilities of being happy, inquiring how we might dwell profoundly in \u2018the everlasting present of our life.\u2019\u201d Spires once told Contemporary Authors, \u201cI think for many people the experience of having a child is a transformative experience, one in which you feel your mortality quite strongly; the poems in\u00a0Worldling\u00a0try to chronicle, directly or obliquely, how I have been changed by the ongoing experience of motherhood, how it has pushed me deeper into my life.\u201d\nSpires\u2019s children\u2019s books include\u00a0With One White Wing\u00a0(1995) and\u00a0Riddle Road: Puzzles in Poems and Pictures (1999).\u00a0These companion picture books offer very young children a chance to guess at rhyming riddles, using the illustrations and the snatches of poetry as clues. The Mouse of Amherst\u00a0(1999) is perhaps Spires\u2019s most celebrated children\u2019s book. The brief but beguiling tale is narrated by Emmaline, a mouse who has taken up residence behind the wall in\u00a0Emily Dickinson\u2019s room. Intrigued by Dickinson\u2019s labors at her desk, Emmaline finally discovers the poet\u2019s talents when a sheet of paper falls to the floor. The inspired mouse responds with her own poetry, and a friendship is struck. A number of reviewers suggested that\u00a0The Mouse of Amherst\u00a0rewards readers by offering historical information about Emily Dickinson and an appreciation for her poems, which are liberally sprinkled throughout the book. In\u00a0Booklist,\u00a0for instance, Susan Dove Lempke wrote, \u201cThe simple story gives young readers a first taste of Dickinson\u2019s poetry as well as an idea of the relationship formed between a poet and a reader.\u201d In the New York Times Book Review, Julie Yates Walton observed that what children will remember from the tale is \u201ca sense of the nourishing power of words. \u2026 Through a mouse\u2019s view of a great poet, Elizabeth Spires makes a convincing argument for poetry\u2019s relevance to our lives.\u201d\n", "attrs": {}}
