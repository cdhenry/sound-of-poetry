He studied at the University of Cambridge and taught at Peterhouse and the University of Cambridge. Crashaw\u2019s\u00a0collections include Poems and Epigrams of Richard Crashaw (1670), A Letter from Mr. Crashaw to the Countess of Denbigh Against Irresolution and Delay in Matters of Religion (1653), Hymns to Our Lord (published posthumously in 1652), and A Book of Sacred Epigrams (1634). The intense and intimate depiction of Crashaw that prefaces his English volumes of poetry (Steps to the Temple, 1646, enlarged 1648) reveals him as a poet in a state of unruffled devotion, the hub of his poetic genius:\nReader, we stile his Sacred Poems, Stepps to the Temple, and aptly, for in the Temple of God, under his wing, he led his life in St. Maries Church neere St. Peters Colledge: There he lodged under Tertullian\u2019s roofe of Angels: There he made his nest more gladly then David\u2019s Swallow neere the house of God: where like a primitive Saint, he offered more prayers in the night, then others usually offer in the day; There, he penned these Poems, Stepps for happy soules to climb heaven by.\nWhoever the \u201cAuthors friend\u201d may be who wrote this \u201cPreface to the Reader,\u201d his portrait made a deep impression on early-17th-century biographers of Crashaw such as David Lloyd and Anthony Wood. Contemporary readers need to appreciate once more that Crashaw\u2019s poetry was first admired as an extension of his prayer life and as the testimony of one who dwelt in the presence of God. Yet few were the \u201chappy soules\u201d who could turn away from the dramatic tragedy of the 17th century and look inward, as Crashaw does, at the \u201clife hid with Christ in God\u201d (Colossians). In his finest contemplative verse, he would reach out from the evening stillness of the sanctuary to an embattled world that was deaf to the soothing sound of Jesus, the name which, to his mind, cradled the cosmos.\n\u00a0\nHow many unknown WORLDS there are\nOf Comforts, which Thou hast in Keeping!\nHow many Thousand Mercyes there\nIn Pitty\u2019s soft lap ly a sleeping!\nHappy he who has the art\nTo awake them\nAnd to take them\nHome, and lodge them in his HEART.\n(\u201cHymn to the Name of Jesus\u201d)\n\nDespite his artistic efforts to awaken spiritual understanding in men, Crashaw remains perhaps the most misunderstood of 17th-century English poets. Though he happily set out to follow in the steps of George Herbert, whose collection of sacred English poems was titled The Temple (1633), Crashaw is usually regarded as the incongruous younger brother of the Metaphysicals who weakens the \u201cstrong line\u201d of their verse or the prodigal son who \u201ctook his journey into a far country\u201d (Luke), namely the Continent and Catholicism. With a mind open to many influences, Crashaw did indeed write poetry rich with \u201cmany WORLDS\u201d (\u201cHymn to the Name of Jesus\u201d); but the most singular journey that he takes is not abroad\u2014it is the inner journey toward that stationary center of human activity so memorably captured in the \u201cPreface to the Reader.\u201d\nIf a fuller appreciation of Crashaw must address the centering activity that goes on in his poetry, it must also explore further the volatile gender states that paradoxically decenter his verse. Already feminist-inspired criticism has upset the conventional wisdom that deplored Crashaw\u2019s \u201cfeminine\u201d sensibility, that is to say, his ardent devotion to women and his partiality for sweet, soft, or maternal images in his verse. The male critical preference for the tougher and supposedly more virile stance of a poet such as John Donne has been challenged by readers who sense that the man\u2019s feminine ways may contain hidden power. The deeply unsettling changes of gender perception which Crashaw encourages are crucial to an understanding of the spiritual intention of his poetry, which is to \u201cunman\u201d the narrow, orthodox mind, \u201cnarrow and low, and infinitely lesse / Then this GREAT mornings mighty Busynes\u201d (\u201cHymn to the Name of Jesus\u201d), which offers resistance to God and so permits his \u201cBright Joyes\u201d to flood the soul.\nJoy is the base note of Crashaw\u2019s poetry; exaltation the promised spiritual effect of his verse. Yet, early in life, Crashaw realized that we are born \u201cdark Sons of Dust and Sorrow.\u201d Just when is not clear; nor, for that matter, is the exact date of his birth. From the devotional as well as literary importance of the Nativity in his poetry, it is conceivable that Crashaw was born on either side of the Christmas season\u2014the Advent period of 1612 or the Epiphany period of 1613. Of his mother no trace survives. There is no way of knowing whether she lingered long enough to shape his primary memories or died during or soon after his birth, inspiring a lifetime of wishful mother thinking. The imprint of loving maternal care at the breast and in the warm nest of a woman\u2019s body, however, can be strongly felt in his poetry. Of the stepmother who showed \u201csingular motherly affection to the child of her predecessor\u201d there is a record, largely thanks to the funeral tributes that were written in 1620 on her death in childbirth. These tributes were printed together as The Honour of Virtue, reprinted in Katherine Usher Henderson and Barbara F. McManus\u2019s Half Humankind (1985). The \u201cMatchless Mistress\u201d Elizabeth Skinner Crashaw died at the age of 24, when the poet was about eight, and after a brief 17 months of marriage to a man twice her age, William Crashaw. Amid the lifeless tributes to her accomplishments as a Christian gentlewoman and new wife, Elizabeth Crashaw emerges as a kindhearted soul who, like her stepson, \u201cwas belou\u2019d by all; dispraysed by none\u201d (Thomas Car\u2019s \u201cAnagramme\u201d prefacing Crashaw\u2019s Carmen Deo Nostro, 1652). According to the funeral sermon in The Honour of Virtue, though \u201cyoung, healthful and living in great content and with a husband after her own heart,\u201d Elizabeth\u2019s pregnancy seems to have been clouded by foreboding that childbirth would prove \u201cboth the baptism of the son and burial of the mother.\u201d She correctly prophesied her own death but had not foreseen that her new-born son would soon follow her. Humbling consciousness of being \u201ca dear-bought son,\u201d indeed, the only surviving child of loving parent figures, never left Crashaw as an artist. Neither did his sense of awe and obligation to the mothers who steeled themselves for sacrifice and were willing to face the dual ordeal of birth and death for the sake of another. The poet would complete his development in an exclusive male environment where strong fathers such as William Crashaw dominated the institutions of state. According to Victor Turner\u2019s The Ritual Process (1969), where patrilineality is the basis of society, as in Stuart England, the individual may form a more disinterested concept of \u201chuman-kindness,\u201d joining men together in a community of greater good through the mother and, by extension, through other women and femininity. In his mature verse, Crashaw\u2019s poetic vision of community would reach through the Virgin Mother and female saints up to the company of heaven and down to an unremembered chain of women on earth. Though weakened by labor, cut down to size by the world, and stifled by premature death, these women provided what Turner called the crucial \u201chuman bond, without which there could be no society,\u201d and it is to his credit that Crashaw never forgot this basic fact.\nAt the time of his stepmother\u2019s death it was marveled that Elizabeth Crashaw could have felt such a strong \u201cstrange affection to her husband.\u201d William Crashaw was a middle-aged Anglican divine from a long-established northern family. Some of the modest income from his early parish work in the Inner Temple, London, in Yorkshire, and finally at St. Mary Matfellon, Whitechapel, which he ministered from 1618 until his death in 1626, undoubtedly subsidized his passion for book collection; but a widower with a substantial library and a lonely son seemed no match for the \u201cyoung gallants and rich heirs\u201d who hoped to join their inheritance with Elizabeth Skinner\u2019s estimated \u201cgreat estate.\u201d It is hard to believe that William Crashaw\u2019s fiery diatribes against popery or his reputation as a Puritan sympathizer could have wooed this gentle lady; but her mourners remarked on her admiration for the profession of clergy, her zeal for pastoral work, and the encouragement that she gave her husband to introduce the morning service from the Book of Common Prayer into his parish. These vestiges of the canonical day offices said in the medieval church would become the nucleus of meditative exercises in Crashaw\u2019s poetry. Indeed, the magnificent invocation at the close of one of his greatest poems recalls the \u201cLitany of General Supplication\u201d that follows morning prayers and begins: \u201cBy thine Agony and bloody Sweat; by thy Cross and Passion; by thy precious Death and Burial ...\u201d In \u201cThe Flaming Heart,\u201d Crashaw\u2019s poetic entreaty to Saint Teresa, he consecrated all the devotion shown by women like his stepmother and joined it to Christ\u2019s Offering on the Cross.\nBetween his stepmother\u2019s death in 1620 and his admission to Charterhouse School in 1629, Crashaw underwent that educational regimen calculated to turn youngsters into precocious sages modeled on the boy Christ, who discoursed to his elders in the temple. Yet if Crashaw\u2019s classical scholarship bears the stamp of humanist learning, he developed no penchant for that hostility to women or denial of a kindhearted maternal world that, according to Richard Helgerson in The Elizabethan Prodigals (1976), characterized traditional English pedagogy; for this he had no less surprising a figure than his own father to thank. Though William Crashaw was a furious disputant of Catholicism and of its ardent devotion to Mary, the Mother of God, his passion in the pulpit softened to tenderness in the home. At his father\u2019s encouragement Crashaw may have composed his early verse rendition of \u201cPsalme 23.\u201d This juvenile exercise, written no later than 1630 and possibly before his father\u2019s death in 1626, is an important link between Crashaw\u2019s childhood, about which we know so tantalizingly little, and the creative life which now began to unfold to him in poetry. The Psalms gave profound instruction to Jesus himself and so were second only to the Gospels in providing Christians edifying meditations and literary inspiration. Psalm 23 was particularly good material for a schoolboy keen to please and perhaps console the father who had been left his sole guardian. \u201cThe Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want\u201d has been the traditional comfort of those who face bereavement and who pray for the serenity and the strength to look beyond death to God\u2019s everlasting life. In contrast to the somber six verses of the original psalm, however, Crashaw composed an ornate and exuberant paraphrase of over seventy lines which begins, \u201cHappy me! O happy sheepe! / Whom my God vouchsafes to keepe.\u201d The poem does not begin with the Lord who is the shepherd but with the sheepish, slightly ridiculous figure that Crashaw himself cuts in the world. As an aspiring poet, Crashaw had also begun to experiment with the expanded epigrams that are a hallmark of the Metaphysical poets; but whereas the Metaphysical poets are noted for the controlled economy they bring to this form, Crashaw already shows an inclination to luxuriate in rather than compress his material. He makes the green pastures and still waters of the original psalm pulse with the creative energy of God, which he recognized as his own source of creativity and the one \u201cthat points me to these wayes of blisse.\u201d In the \u201ccheerefull spring\u201d of his poetic art, Crashaw had begun to employ ebullient, fanciful, outr\u00e9 imagery, such as that of \u201cthe blubb\u2019ring Mountaine\u201d which \u201cWeeping, melts into a Fountaine.\u201d It would be a mistake, however, to conclude simply that he had picked up bad habits early in his artistic development or that these habits were learned from his father, who showed an excess of zeal in his own religious writings and whose Manuall for True Catholickes (1611) can be felt as an influence in \u201cPsalme 23.\u201d As T.S. Eliot was among the first to appreciate, \u201cthere is brainwork\u201d behind the seeming perversity and outrageousness of Crashaw\u2019s language.\nWhat is crucial to a real as opposed to a formally argued appreciation of Crashaw is a recognition that he deliberately reveled in his own weakness, for his weakness taught him to turn inward to Christ for strength and outward to the many guardians, his father chief among them, whom he would depend upon to shepherd him over the course of his life. The poet who continued to babble away in his mature verse was thus not afraid to depict the speaker in \u201cPsalme 23\u201d as hopelessly ill equipped to fend for himself. God must \u201cpoint\u201d him in the right direction, must rescue him when he in \u201csimple weaknesse strayes, / (Tangled in forbidden wayes).\u201d The unquestioning faith which alienates modern readers of his devotional verse reflects an early intuition that he had found the path of his own bliss and that both friends and foes would show the \u201cWay for a resolved mind.\u201d The Psalms were composed by David the shepherd boy. The confidence and the trust in Crashaw\u2019s psalm paraphrase suggest that in his own childhood the poet may have felt David\u2019s primitive sense of closeness to God. Certainly, there is no fear of God or trepidation at the prospect of dying in his poem, though his own family life could not protect him from the hurt of bereavement. Nor does his speaker seem burdened by sin, though this has been interpreted as incognizance by hostile readers. When one considers that the speaker depicts himself as a silly sheep, or a foolish, wayward child, it becomes evident that Crashaw did not see sin as wickedness so much as another form of weakness. In the most original move of \u201cPsalme 23,\u201d he depicts God not only as the Good Shepherd but also as the Good Mother who first \u201csings my soule to rest\u201d; who later feeds him in Holy Writ and in the Eucharistic bread as earlier \u201cat her brest\u201d; and who finally welcomes him with open arms in death. The movement of this poem prefigures not only the shape of Crashaw\u2019s art but the direction of his whole life.\nIt is hard to believe that Crashaw would have shown this precocious awareness of the feminine core of the Lord\u2019s goodness to man had he not seen in his father something of the motherhood of God. It is known for a fact that in William Crashaw\u2019s extensive theological library his son had access to the accounts of female mystics and visionaries of the medieval church, and perhaps there this dreamy young man first seriously reflected on the idea of Christ as protomother. The poet\u2019s later involvement at Cambridge in the Laudian restoration of the Anglican church, in Marian devotion, and in Catholic-looking observances has been readily perceived as a conscious denial of his father\u2019s crusade against the Church of Rome. According to E.I. Watkin, however, William Crashaw\u2019s passionate concern that Anglicanism should embody the purity of the primitive and medieval church suggests that the poet\u2019s feminine-sounding faith was rather the completion and liberation of his father\u2019s emotional religious views. When his father died in 1626, Richard Crashaw, now entering his teens, became the charge of the lawyers Sir Henry Yelverton and Sir Randolph Crew. Three years later he was admitted to the distinguished Charterhouse School, where he bloomed under the indulgent eye of its Royalist head, Robert Brook, who was later expelled from this position around the time Crashaw fled from Cambridge in 1643. At Charterhouse Crashaw perfected the rigorous discipline of the classicist and epigrammatist. Every Sunday he was obliged to compose four Greek and four Latin verses on the New Testament reading at the second lesson of matins, a practice he continued on a Watt scholarship to Pembroke College, Cambridge, from 1631 to 1634. He produced his first volume of poetry at Cambridge in 1634, the Epigrammatum Sacrorum Liber, a collection of his classical epigrams on the morning service which had so moved his stepmother. These verses reveal new springs of tenderness as he became absorbed in a Laudian theology of love, in the religious philanthropy practiced by his Pembroke master, Benjamin Laney, and preached by his tutor, John Tournay, and in the passionate poetic study of the Virgin Mother and Christ Child.\nCrashaw\u2019s reputation as \u201cthe chaplaine of the virgin myld\u201d (Car\u2019s \u201cAnagramme\u201d) would be cemented at Peterhouse where he was elected to a fellowship in 1635. In secular verses from his undergraduate days such as \u201cWishes to his (supposed) Mistresse,\u201d however, he salutes the lady of his ardent imagination. The most brilliant of these exercises, \u201cMusicks Duell,\u201d brings together his academic interest in translating Jesuit Neo-Latin verse with an altogether more worldly knowledge of Thomas Carew\u2019s bold erotic masterpiece, \u201cA Rapture.\u201d It would be wrong, then, to conclude from Car\u2019s posthumous allusion to \u201chis virgin thoughtes and words\u201d that Crashaw was indifferent to the force of sexuality. But by the time he took holy orders and was appointed to the Peterhouse curacy of Little St. Mary\u2019s around 1638, he had chosen to live as he would die \u201cin th\u2019virgines lappe\u201d; and in this maternal framework his supreme development took place. According to Allan Pritchard, even the Puritan informers who kept the High Church rituals of Peterhouse under surveillance could sense the spiritually charged atmosphere that pervaded the sanctuary as Crashaw \u201cturned himselfe to ye picture of the Virgin Mary ... and used these words \u2018Hanc adoramus, colamus hanc\u2019\u201d (We adore her, we worship her). Indeed, one of Crashaw\u2019s early English epigrams, translated from a Latin exercise commemorating the Annunciation in 1632, is often depicted as a poetic reproduction of the religious paintings in which the Virgin adores the child seated on her lap. However, in this epigram, Mary is not richly adorned but represented unassumingly, and more to the point of Crashaw\u2019s title, \u201cOn the Blessed Virgins bashfulnesse,\u201d indirectly. No sentimental allusion to the Virgin\u2019s maiden shyness is being made in the title of his epigram which begins, \u201cThat on her lap she casts her humble Eye,\u201d and ends, \u201c\u2018Twas once looke up, \u2019tis now looke downe to Heaven.\u201d Mary\u2019s face is hidden from the reader because it is fixed on Christ, who is the true focus of the poem. In an understated way Crashaw was refuting his detractors who accused him of idolizing the Virgin or who regarded Marian veneration as an arrogation of the honor due to Christ alone. Crashaw was also declaring his solidarity with Anthony Stafford\u2019s Laudian promotion of Mary in The Femall Glory, published in 1635:\n\u00a0\nYet would I not idolatrize thy worth,\nLike some, whose superstition sets thee forth,\nIn costly ornaments, in cloathes so gay,\nSo rich as never in the stable lay.\n.............................\nI cannot thinke thy Virgin bashfulnesse\nWould weare the Lady of Lorettos dresse.\nFrom the explicit reference to Stafford\u2019s citation of \u201cVirgin bashfulnesse\u201d in the title of Crashaw\u2019s own epigram, it may be concluded that he wrote this poem soon after his arrival at Peterhouse; but the ceremonial ostentation of Laudian practices there and the devotional excess of the Italian shrine of Our Lady of Loreto, where Crashaw would die in 1649, have often obscured the important ways in which the Virgin simplified his faith even as she inspired more sophisticated expressions of his art. If Peterhouse was the \u201clittle contenfull kingdom\u201d (letter written at Leiden, Holland, February 20, 1644) in which he polished his poetry and purified his prayer life from 1635 until 1643, \u201cOn the Blessed Virgins bashfulnesse\u201d is the \u201ccontentfull Cell\u201d (\u201cDescription of a Religious House\u201d) epitomizing his later development. Like the proverbial mustard seed of the Gospels, the epigram hides the great truth of the Incarnation within its small, eight-line form: \u201c\u2019Tis Heav\u2019n \u2019tis Heaven she sees, Heavens God there lyes.\u201d At the Annunciation it had been revealed to Mary that she would become the mother of \u201cHeavens God\u201d; but as Crashaw contemplated what this feast meant to him, first in Latin and then in English verse, he saw that at the heart of the mystery of the Incarnation lay Christ\u2019s promise that the kingdom of Heaven is within everyone. It was the \u201cleast of your least,\u201d as Crashaw realized when he signed himself \u201cTuorum minimorum minimus\u201d in the \u201cEpistle Dedicatory\u201d to the Epigrammatum Sacrorum Liber, who would inherit this kingdom because they alone were willing to minimize the self in importance. The difficulties that critics have with Crashaw\u2019s poetry and their almost invariable preference for Donne\u2019s religious sonnets, in which the human and divine ego are locked in a power struggle, indicate how highly self-consciousness is prized among readers. Yet, to read Crashaw\u2019s epigram, we are obliged to quiet the designing mind that clamors to be the center of attention. Foes who branded Crashaw \u201cthe chaplaine of the virgine myld\u201d saw him rapt in prayer before the icon of the Virgin in Peterhouse College chapel. What this poem suggests, however, is that he learned to pray by contemplating her reflection on Christ.\nMary showed Crashaw his way forward in prayer and in poetry. Both are disciplines demanding periods of silence, self-abandonment, and solitude; and they thus require of the man or woman considerable courage, a courage observed in the Virgin at the Annunciation, who was prepared to \u201cgo it alone\u201d as a mother. As Crashaw\u2019s devotion to Mary grew at Peterhouse, so did his readiness to put himself at risk politically as well as poetically. Indeed, Paul A. Parrish shows how Crashaw\u2019s life and art demonstrate a fidelity to feminine virtues that are opposed to a masculine world of power, domination, and control. It would be a mistake to see these as cloistered virtues, though they were, no doubt, fostered by prolonged prayer \u201cin the Temple of God.\u201d From his nightly vigils before the altar of Little St. Mary\u2019s, Crashaw emerged like the medieval knight who vowed to serve the weakest members of his society. In his final days at Pembroke he had come out in support of his tutor, Tournay, who preached against the Puritan emphasis of faith at the expense of love. In a concurring Latin poem, \u201cFides qu\u00e6 sola justificat,\u201d Crashaw depicted \u201cthis Faith alone so sadly, so desolately alone,\u201d like an aging widow, devoid of family and friends and bereft of their charity. When he first came to Peterhouse, the poet became further embroiled in the theological controversy raging at Cambridge between Puritans and Laudians when he wrote a preface in verse, \u201cUpon the ensuing Treatises,\u201d for Robert Shelford\u2019s Five Pious and Learned Discourses (1635) and reiterated Saint Paul\u2019s warning to the Corinthians: \u201cthough I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.\u201d In this remarkable poem Crashaw made it his radical \u201cmasculine theme\u201d to create a feminine environment in which religion was no longer the blunt instrument of political power but the generous outpouring of the \u201ctame and tender heart,\u201d \u201cmeek and humble eyes\u201d like those of the bashful Virgin. His speaker reaches out in love to the \u201cpoore,\u201d the homeless, and, astonishingly, to the pope himself: \u201cIn summe, no longer shall our people hope, / To be a true Protestant, \u2018s but to hate the Pope.\u201d In expressing his Christian love for all men, even the archenemy of his father and most English Protestants, Crashaw began to feel what it was like for Christ to be a stranger in his own land. Taking Shelford\u2019s words in his \u201cFirst Discourse\u201d to heart\u2014\u201cin God\u2019s service we must neither see father nor mother, brother nor sister ... nor our own selves neither\u201d\u2014Crashaw would begin to let go of the past and become dispossessed like the Mother and Child.\nThe \u201cHymn in the Holy Nativity,\u201d which may have been drafted as early as 1637, was the first of three Christmastide hymns that would eventually appear as a trio in the Carmen Deo Nostro. In this first hymn Crashaw was inspired by the Nativity Gospel of Luke to emulate the song of joy which the shepherds improvised as they returned to their fields after beholding the Virgin and her newborn son in the manger. It is interesting to note that the first version of this hymn was placed almost immediately after \u201cPsalme 23\u201d in the 1646 Steps to the Temple. It would thus appear that this Nativity hymn was positioned to underline the poet\u2019s own identification not only with the stray sheep but with the \u201cpoor Shepheards, home-spun things: / Whose Wealth\u2019s their flock; whose witt, to be / Well read in their simplicity\u201d (1652 version of \u201cHymn in the Holy Nativity\u201d). Moreover, as all eyes of the shepherds are on the infant Jesus asleep at the warm breast of his Mother, we can once again see how Crashaw used the Virgin and Child as an icon that focused his poetic attention and clarified the meditative purpose of his art, which was prayerful absorption in God. In his final version of the hymn published in Carmen Deo Nostro, the sensuous stanza, in which Mary quiets her child with a mother\u2019s tender breast and lullaby, would be eliminated. For some the image of the woman openly breastfeeding her child is either too sentimental or too unseemly. The only image in Crashaw\u2019s poetry which exceeds that of the Virgin exposing her breast and offering it to her crying baby in its vulnerability is that of Christ stretched on the Cross, his breast exposed to the centurion\u2019s lance. Crashaw was not afraid to show his \u201cfeminine\u201d sensitivity to the most vulnerable members of society. His poetic rituals of vulnerability are a declaration of the opening of the heart to God that transpires in prayer. The lyrical stanza in which the Virgin\u2019s voice can be heard above that of the shepherds as \u201cShe sings thy Teares asleepe, and dips / Her Kisses in thy weeping Eye\u201d would be cut from the 1652 version of the hymn. Given the poet\u2019s passionate devotion to the Virgin Mother, it cannot have been easy for him to sacrifice these lines \u201cAnd let the MIGHTY BABE alone. / The Ph\u00e6nix builds the Ph\u00e6nix\u2019 nest. / LOVE\u2019s architecture is his own\u201d; but no more authentic step could he have taken to affirm the necessity of self-surrender:\n\u00a0\nTo thee meeke Majesty! soft KING\nOf simple GRACES and sweet LOVES.\nEach of us his lamb will bring\nEach his pair of sylver Doves;\nTill burnt at last in fire of Thy fair eyes,\nOur selves become our own best SACRIFICE.\nIn this closing stanza the most powerful image of the hymn is fully released. It is the image of the child as the new light source to replace the sun, a mystical concept Crashaw would explore in all its terrible beauty in the Epiphany hymn. For much of the Nativity hymn, however, the fearsome energy of the child was hidden by the body of his mother, an adroit indication of how God incarnated himself in the obscurity of human flesh. At the end of the hymn, however, the shepherds no longer make the Old Testament sacrifice of burnt offerings. Imitating the divine child, who will become both their Good Shepherd and their Paschal Lamb, they are set alight with love as they gaze \u201cin fire of Thy fair eyes.\u201d\nWhat Crashaw was trying to suggest about the direct encounter with God in prayer is clarified by his august companion piece, \u201cHymn in the Glorious Epiphanie,\u201d which commemorates the Adoration of the Magi celebrated on January 6 as the feast in which Christ was made manifest to the Gentiles. The poem begins where the Nativity hymn left off, depicting the child mystically as the \u201cBright BABE! Whose awfull beautyes\u201d disinherit the sun; and it examines the adjustments in perception that must be made if the world is to live and grow in the light of Christ, the Lumen de Lumine. Like the shepherds and their sheep, the wise men too \u201cstrangely went astray,\u201d not through slowness or stupidity, but the intellectual brilliance that is often at work in Metaphysical wit or contemporary criticism. As the poet reviewed a long human history of mistaken beliefs, clever conceits, specious theories\u2014all personified by pagan sun worship\u2014he was aware that every age has its \u201cBright IDOL.\u201d According to Pritchard, when the Puritan investigators sought evidence in 1641 of popish image worship in the Laudian church services of Peterhouse, Crashaw himself would be cited for Mariolatry and for his superstitious practices of \u201cdiverse bowings, cringeings\u201d and incensing before the altar. In turn, Crashaw saw the Puritan\u2019s religious intolerance and dogmatic iconoclasm as forms of self-idolatry. Idols reveal the susceptibility of all parties\u2014Laudian, Puritan, Catholic, Protestant\u2014to make themselves and not their God the center of life. In the final section of the Epiphany hymn the Crucifixion is represented as the portentous moment when mankind will be freed of its idols. Yet the Three Kings insist at the outset that the Christ child is the whole point of the poem\u2014\u201cAll-circling point. All centring sphear. / The world\u2019s one, round, \u00c6ternall year\u201d\u2014that Christ is mother as well as child: \u201cO little all! in thy embrace / The world lyes warm, and likes his place.\u201d Only near the end of the hymn does it become possible to introduce the concept of the via negativa (negative path) conceived by Dionysius the Areopagite after he reportedly witnessed the ominous eclipse of the sun when the Son of God died on the Cross. The concept, that God can only be described in terms of what he is not, is only conceivable if the centering activity integral to prayer occurs and life no longer revolves around the sun or the self but Christ: \u201cThus shall that reverend child of light, / By being scholler first of that new night, / Come forth Great master of the mystick day.\u201d\nGiven the sensuous development of his poetic devotions, critics have wondered whether the Epiphany hymn represents \u201csome attempted and never consummated change in the character of Crashaw\u2019s religious life and his poetic method.\u201d Indeed, Austin Warren suspects that he was temperamentally unsuited to pursue any further poetic experiment with the via negativa. Almost all of Crashaw\u2019s poetry, however, is some form of meditative exercise, the aim of which is to guide the reader toward the light of vision turned wholly on God. Crashaw\u2019s poetry takes us to the brink, the moment to which all prayer leads, the moment of apophatic wisdom when everything to do with the conscious self must be abandoned\u2014images, ideas, words\u2014and fall away before God. His dilemma as a poet was acute: he depended on artful language and thought and yet was striving to capture the non-conceptual, self-disregarding state of pure contemplation. Rather than burn his poetry, as other Renaissance poets did, Crashaw chose to follow the ardent path of the shepherds leading to ecstatic self-sacrifice, or the more taxing example of Mary which was unsung self-effacement. Neither course has been looked at sympathetically by his modern critics. If they do not read sexual sublimation or, worse, perversion into what William Butler Yeats might have called \u201cthe uncontrollable mystery\u201d of Crashaw\u2019s work, they feel that he concentrates an abnormal amount of his poetic energy on a woman who is meek, mild, and mindless.\nIn his own day the poet\u2019s devout raptures were seen as the fruit of the intensive prayer program devised by his master at Peterhouse, John Cosin, or practiced by the spiritual community of Little Gidding. This was the first and only religious house to be formed after the traumatic dissolution of the monasteries during the Reformation. Little Gidding was founded in 1625 by Nicholas Ferrar, close friend of George Herbert and the original editor of his Temple. The devotional adherence at Little Gidding to older forms of piety such as round-the-clock prayer vigils and to relics of the old religion such as crucifixes or madonnas obviously attracted Crashaw, who was involved in similar practices and adornments at Peterhouse. Both he and the Ferrar family would also attract the unwelcome attention of the Puritans, who branded Little Gidding an \u201cArmenian nunnery\u201d and leveled it to the ground in 1647. Crashaw\u2019s intimate association with the Ferrar community dates from at least 1636, when the nephew of Nicholas Ferrar, Ferrar Collet, became his pupil at Peterhouse. It is possible, however, that the poet was introduced to the family as a boy by his own father through an early association with the Virginia Company. Indeed, his youthful poetic exercise \u201cPsalme 23\u201d could have originated from the psalm readings which were so important a feature of the daily worship at Little Gidding. If Richard Crashaw was not acquainted with Little Gidding from the time of its inception, he certainly showed a lifelong devotion to its members. After his flight abroad to Leiden, in 1644, he was anxious to see his college fellowship transferred to Ferrar Collet and to uphold the honor of Ferrar\u2019s chaste sister, Mary Collet, the \u201cgratious mother\u201d for whom he had strong feelings.\nIn \u201cDescription of a Religious House,\u201d first published in 1648 alongside Latin tributes to Peterhouse, Crashaw extolled the monastic life practiced at Little Gidding. This georgic poem of aching beauty enunciates his commitment to prayer as life in which he is conscious of God\u2019s presence in daily work\u2014\u201cHands full of harty labours; Paines that pay / And prize themselves; doe much, that more they may\u201d\u2014and sees his redemption at work even in \u201cthe sweat of this daye\u2019s sorrows.\u201d In the opening of this poem Crashaw emphatically disclaims \u201croofes of gold,\u201d \u201criotous tables shining,\u201d \u201cendlesse dining,\u201d and \u201ctyrian silk proud pavements sweeping\u201d as \u201ctumultuous joyes\u201d and \u201cfalse showes of short and slippery good.\u201d For the soul who loves God more than the world, the quality of life cannot be separated from the quiet practice of prayer:\n\u00a0\nSilence, and sacred rest; peace, and pure joyes;\nKind loves keep house, ly close, and make no noise,\nAnd room enough for Monarchs, while none swells\nBeyond the kingdomes of contentfull Cells.\nIn the letter that he wrote while in exile, probably to the Ferrar family, Crashaw would express his longing to return to the \u201clittle contenfull kingdom\u201d of Peterhouse, a longing which no doubt included the \u201ccontentfull Cells\u201d of neighboring Little Gidding. The longing for home is deeply imprinted in Crashaw\u2019s poetry and psychic makeup. He sought this home in an undifferentiated community like Little Gidding open to men and women; welcoming Protestants and Catholics; exhibiting \u201cfeminine\u201d qualities, \u201csoft\u201d and \u201csweet,\u201d and masculine virtues, \u201chard\u201d and \u201charty.\u201d He saw this home in the heaven that the Virgin made for her son in her womb, lap, and bosom. He ultimately finds it in the closing line of his poem when \u201cthe self-remembering SOUL / ... / ... meditates her immortall way / Home to the original source of LIGHT and intellectuall Day.\u201d Once again, Crashaw depicted his art as one of meditation, a repeated, rapturous discovery that God has made his home and his heaven in the center of every soul.\nCrashaw\u2019s decade or so of piety at Cambridge, from 1631 until the end of 1642, was the most idyllic period of his short life. He experienced not only the depth but the height of Christ\u2019s love, and Crashaw\u2019s spiritual joy is evident in \u201cO Gloriosa Domina,\u201d his paean to Mary as generatrix of goodness, not sin. With the support of his college friend and fellow poet, Joseph Beaumont, whose Laudian piety would also scandalize Puritans, Crashaw celebrated the \u201cGlorious Assumption\u201d of the Virgin. Though the Assumption was not formally recognized in the seventeenth century as an article of either Anglican or Roman faith, it allowed Crashaw to pursue his spiritual conviction that Christ stirs within the depths of our humanity and calls us to rise to his divine height. According to David Lloyd\u2019s Memoires (1668), Crashaw\u2019s church services were thronged with Christians eager for this message in sermons \u201cthat ravished more like Poems, than both the Poet and Saint ... scattering not so much Sentences [as] Extasies.\u201d In fact, the appreciative editor of Crashaw\u2019s Steps to the Temple, who could well have been Beaumont, promised in the preface that the poet\u2019s verse would have much the same effect and \u201clift thee Reader, some yards above the ground.\u201d It was certainly Beaumont who in 1638 broadcast word of an elevated woman whose name and works were unheard of in English\u2014the mystical Saint Teresa of Avila. Crashaw\u2019s three poems in her honor\u2014\r\n\u201cA Hymn to the Name and Honour of the Admirable Saint Teresa,\u201d \u201cAn Apologie for the fore-going Hymne,\u201d and \u201c The Flaming Heart\u201d\u2014are, arguably, his most sublime works; they have earned him a new following among contemporary readers. These three poems form a triptych to the woman saint, representing three stages of faith: the institutional, critical, and mystical; three phases of human attachment: child, adult, and parent; and three expressions of gender: feminine, masculine, and androgynous. Just as Christians have difficulty in conceiving that there are three persons in one God, so they cannot see how in faith and in love they themselves approximate the Trinity. Indeed, the triune God is the prototype for Teresa\u2019s spiritual achievement, which is to embody all humanity in her \u201cFlaming Heart.\u201d\n\r\nThe full title of \u201cA Hymn to Sainte Teresa\u201d describes Teresa as \u201cA WOMAN for Angelicall heigth of speculation, for Masculine courage of performance, more then a woman. WHO Yet a child, out ran maturity, and durst plott a Martyrdome.\u201d According to Parrish, Teresa remains throughout the poem the child-woman who confounds all those of greater maturity. At the beginning of the hymn, she plans the first of her great escapes at age six, running away from home to bring Christian salvation to the Moors and win the martyr\u2019s instantaneous admission to heaven. Her role models are the Spanish conquistadores, such as her own brother: \u201cold Souldiers, Great and tall, / Ripe Men of Martyrdom\u201d who defend the doctrinal traditions and institutional history of the church militant. Teresa\u2019s spiritual growth involves unlearning their instruction to her in childhood and listening with a mystical wisdom, which has nothing to do with age, to the God who communicates directly to her from within:\n\u00a0\nSWEET, not so fast! lo thy fair Spouse\nWhom thou seekst with so swift vowes,\nCalls thee back, and bidds thee come\nT\u2019embrace a milder MARTYRDOM.\nStripped of male heroics, the martyr is simply one who bears witness in life to Christ. Socially prevented in childhood and by womanhood from the masculine conquest of new worlds, Teresa is gently turned to the conquest that absorbed the poet, the conquest of that mysterious world of the inner self. The latter half of the hymn draws on Teresa\u2019s own ecstatic account of her mystical transverberation and on images throbbing with eroticism to write \u201cLove\u2019s noble history.\u201d This is not a history of subjugation or indoctrination but of surrender to Christ\u2019s enlargement of the heart and to a love which stretches from the \u201cmild / And milky soul of a soft child\u201d to the milky way of heaven. In the second of his Teresa poems, \u201cAn Apologie for the fore-going Hymne,\u201d Crashaw turns from this inner vision of Christ\u2019s all-embracing love to question the social prejudices that divide the Church on earth:\n\u00a0\nForbid it, mighty Love! let no fond Hate\nOf names and wordes, so farr pr\u00e6judicate.\nSouls are not SPANIARDS too, one freindly floud\nOf BAPTISM blends them all into a blood.\nCrashaw makes no apology for the fact that as an Anglican poet he has taken a Spaniard, a woman, and a Catholic for his subject\u2014but only that neither this nor the foregoing hymn can capture Teresa\u2019s eloquence. He exhorts his fellow Christians to make peace with one another, but both his poetry and Teresa\u2019s writings on prayer direct readers to find this peace, which comes from Christ, first within themselves. At the end of the poem he elevates the Eucharistic chalice that he was accustomed to handling as a celebrant at Little St. Mary\u2019s. It is filled with a communion wine strong in love, the only cordial for the stricken 17th-century heart. \u201cThe Flaming Heart,\u201d which completes his Teresa trilogy, alludes to a 1642 English translation of her life. Added to the Steps in 1648, Crashaw\u2019s poem is the most intricate of his tributes. The poet opens with the commanding voice of church authority:\n\u00a0\nReaders, be rul\u2019d by me; and make\nHere a well-plac\u2019t and wise mistake,\nYou must transpose the picture quite,\nAnd spell it wrong to read it right [.]\nHis initial dispute is with the painter who drew a crude and childish illustration of the saint pierced through the heart by the dart of the seraphim. As a poet, Crashaw upheld the traditional superiority of the word to the picture in conveying such inner mysteries; but, as a painter himself, he was praised in Car\u2019s \u201cEpigramme\u201d (1652) for the \u201choly strife\u201d between his pen and pencil as to \u201cWhich might draw vertue better to the life.\u201d Crashaw thus proposes to correct the painter\u2019s misconstruction with his own writer\u2019s pen and, in particular, to address the gender misconceptions that have led the artist to mock \u201cwith female FROST love\u2019s manly flame\u201d by painting \u201cSome weak, inferiour, woman saint.\u201d In the second section of the poem, which begins around line 69, he strives to reproduce Teresa\u2019s flaming heart. This heart personifies that which he must bring about in his own \u201chard, cold, hart,\u201d a spiritual transformation of self described in Galatians as a transformation in which \u201cthere is neither male nor female,\u201d neither parent nor child, strong nor weak, active nor passive, \u201cfor ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d In the magnificent entreaty that culminates the poem, Crashaw invokes not only \u201call the eagle in thee, all the dove\u201d but the pious memory of his own parents. He also concedes that both the verbal and the visual image fade away before Teresa\u2019s indescribable communion with God: \u201cBy all of HIM we have in THEE; / Leave nothing of my SELF in me.\u201d Though, in conclusion, he effaced himself and his art before the woman saint, he did not wish to dwell on Teresa so much as on Christ, who dwelled in her heart.\n\r\nCrashaw\u2019s remarkable Teresa trilogy is the product of an inclusive prayer life in which he made God his center and saw God as the source of a more harmonious knowledge of the self and of others. If these poems nudge readers to relearn and unlearn many assumptions about the shape of the spiritual life, Crashaw himself was now forced by the destruction of the Civil War to wean himself from the security and the bliss he had found at Peterhouse. His movements after his disappearance from Cambridge in early 1643 remain something of a mystery and suggest a life in painful disarray. He may first have fled to nearby Little Gidding before making his way to a friend in Lincolnshire, with whom he left a private manuscript of his poems. He is next heard of in Leiden, when, on February 20, 1644, he writes his only surviving English letter, either to the Ferrar family or Beaumont. Scandalized by the secularism of Dutch life, denied access to his spiritual mother in exile, Mary Collet, by her uncles, Crashaw beseeches the friends he has left behind: \u201cwhat must I doe? what must I bee?\u201d It is possible that shortly thereafter Crashaw made his way back to England and found temporary shelter at the Oxford court of Queen Henrietta Maria. Those who would aid him in his final distress were present here with the queen\u2014Abraham Cowley, another Cambridge friend and poet, and Susan Feilding, Countess of Denbigh and First Lady of the Bedchamber. The queen and her entourage fled to Paris in July 1644, and Crashaw went to ground, perhaps on the run in England, perhaps adrift on the Continent. Eventually surfacing in Paris sometime in 1645, Crashaw confided in Thomas Car, the experienced confessor to English refugees. The poet\u2019s vagrant existence made a lasting impression on Car, as shown by \u201cThe Anagramme\u201d:\n\u00a0\nHe seeks no downes, no sheetes, his bed\u2019s still made.\nIf he can find a chaire or stoole, he\u2019s layd,\nWhen day peepes in, he quitts his restlesse rest.\nAnd still, poore soule, before he\u2019s up he\u2019s dres\u2019t.\n\n\nFor much of his life Crashaw was content to prosper as the birds of the air or the lilies of the field \u201cand seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind\u201d (Luke). On the Continent he still sought the kingdom of heaven but simply could not have survived without the material intervention of his new friends, especially when his old ones spoke of him in the \u201cPreface to the Reader\u201d as \u201cthis Learned young Gentleman (now dead to us).\u201d The countess of Denbigh used her influence to persuade the queen in early September 1646 to recommend Crashaw to the pope. The poet expressed the ardent gratitude of the Roman convert by entrusting his poems to Car for a new Catholic volume of his verse, Carmen Deo Nostro, and by ensuring that this volume, which was published posthumously in 1652, would be dedicated to the countess \u201cin acknowledgment of her Goodnes & Charity\u201d and in hopes of her own imminent conversion. Yet there was a malicious report published in a volume titled Legenda lignea (1652) that Crashaw had attached himself to \u201cdeluded, vain-glorious Ladies, and their friends.\u201d In his poems of devotional instruction such as \u201cLetter to the Countess of Denbigh\u201d or \u201cOde on a Prayer-book,\u201d he did not hide the sense of failure as well as success, of frustration as well as sweetness, that dogs the spiritual life. These poems are flawed as human nature itself is flawed. The nervous, excited imagery in \u201cLetter to the Countess of Denbigh\u201d of a \u201cHeav\u2019n-beseiged Heart\u201d that \u201cStands Trembling at the Gate of Blisse\u201d but \u201cdares not venture\u201d inside is an honest reflection of the struggle both for discipline and for release in prayer. Crashaw\u2019s controversial epigram \u201cBlessed be the paps which Thou hast sucked\u201d is addressed not to Mary but to weaker handmaidens of the Lord. In meditating on scripture, these women pray that Christ may be incarnated in their hearts but discover a deep unwillingness to respond wholly to his word, a phenomenon further demonstrated by the strong critical resistance to this poem. Even in Crashaw\u2019s other notorious poem, \u201cThe Weeper,\u201d imagery is used lavishly to surfeit and to shut down the mind. The repetition that mars this work as poetry functions as a mantric device to release the prayer that, with Mary Magdalene\u2019s tears, wells up to heaven from the heart.\n\r\nBolstered by the great hopes that the English Catholic community abroad had of him, Crashaw made his way as a pilgrim to Rome in November 1646. For the next year he struggled with poverty and ill health, and while waiting for some papal retainer, is reputed by Sir Robert Southwell to have complained that \u201cif the Roman church be not founded upon a rock, it is at least founded upon something which is as hard as a rock.\u201d After renewed diplomatic entreaties to the pope in 1647, Crashaw secured a post with the virtuous Cardinal Palotto who was closely associated with the English College. Finally, in April 1649, the cardinal procured him a cathedral benefice at the Virgin\u2019s socalled Holy House and Shrine, the Santa Casa at Loreto. Weakened by his precarious existence in exile, Crashaw set out for Loreto in May and died there of a fever on August 21, 1649. This \u201cpoore soule\u201d was only 36. No one conversant with the last wretched stage of Crashaw\u2019s life can see his poetry as insulated from suffering. As he drew near to the fabled house in Loreto, which was reputed to be where Mary was born and where she received the Annunciation, Crashaw must have thought he was on the home stretch. In a manner of speaking he was; but like Mary in \u201cSancta Maria Dolorum\u201d he would first have to endure the pain of the Cross and look death in the face:\n\u00a0\nBefore her eyes\nHer\u2019s, and the whole world\u2019s joyes,\nHanging all torn she sees; and in his woes\nAnd Paines, her Pangs and throes.\nEach wound of His, from every Part,\nAll, more at home in her owne heart.\n\n\nIn this unique reworking of the Latin hymn \u201cStabat Mater,\u201d he studies the mother heartsick with grief before her crucified son: \u201cHis Nailes write swords in her, which soon her heart / Payes back, with more then their own smart.\u201d Just as Saint Teresa\u2019s heart was pierced by the seraphim\u2019s dart, so here Mary is transfixed by a Metaphysical sword of sorrow that corresponds to Christ\u2019s pain, especially to the deathblow he received from the centurion\u2019s spear. As an Anglican cleric at Little St. Mary\u2019s, he had often contemplated a picture of the Virgin Mother. According to Paul Cardile in an essay published in Cristiana (1984), such paintings were often hung over altar tables and depicted Mary\u2019s priestly role at the Crucifixion, Presentation in the Temple, or Nativity. Little Gidding was noted for its mater dolorosas. In his tribute to the mother of sorrows, the poet now asked Mary to teach him the meaning of sacrifice, which lay at the heart of his own priesthood:\n\u00a0\nBy all those stings\nOf love, sweet bitter things,\nWhich these torn hands transcrib\u2019d on thy true heart\nO teach mine too the art\nTo study him so, till we mix\nWounds; and become one crucifix.\nIn her maternal compassion Mary showed Crashaw what Christ suffered because he took mankind\u2019s own suffering to heart. Crashaw spoke as an Anglican priest, and he was never ordained in the Roman Church. He died a mere \u201cbeneficiatus\u201d responsible only for singing the office in the basilica and having no active share in the great offering he had depicted. His lesser part corresponded to that of the angels who often attended Mary in paintings depicting her priestly mediation. They were sometimes dressed in the vestments of minor orders that Crashaw would have worn and been buried in at Loreto. His worldly friend, Abraham Cowley, described how fitting such a death was for a poet who spoke with the tongues of men and of angels:\n\u00a0\nHow well (blest Swan) did Fate contrive thy death;\nAnd made thee render up they tuneful breath\nIn thy great Mistress Arms; thou most divine\nAnd richest Off\u2019ering of Loretto\u2019s Shrine!\nWhere like some holy Sacrifice t\u2019expire,\nA Fever burns thee, and Love lights the Fire.\nAngels (they say) brought the fam\u2019ed Chappel there,\n............................................\nTis surer much they brought thee there, and They,\nAnd Thou, their charge, went singing all the way.\nIn \u201cPsalme 23\u201d Crashaw had expressed the juvenescent hope that his end would be his beginning \u201cAnd thence my ripe soule will I breath / Warme into the Armes of Death.\u201d \u201cHope,\u201d Cowley had asserted in a poetic debate with Crashaw at Cambridge, \u201cis the most hopelesse thing of all.\u201d Cowley might well have felt his point was proved when according to Wood\u2019s Athen\u00e6 Oxonienses (1691, 1692), he found his friend in Paris \u201ca meer Scholar and very shiftless.\u201d Yet from childhood Crashaw had treasured hopes of heaven, not of earthly reward. In death he was honored by Cowley for his poetic intimation of a deeper and higher wisdom to life, which eluded the subjects of a more knowing world.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
