In 1890, a reviewer for The Atlantic described the poems in The Legend of a Thought as \u201cpleasing, unpretentious verses.\u201d In addition to her debut collection, The Legend of a Thought (1889, published under the name Martha Agnes Rand), her books of poetry include The Border of the Lake (1910), The Sharing (1914), Faces and Open Doors (1922), and New Lyrics and a Few Old Ones (1931). She is the author of a collection of children\u2019s verse, The Round Rabbit (1898), and translated Th\u00e9ophile Gautier\u2019s Enamels and Cameos and Other Poems (1903). \u00a0 Lee published frequently in Poetry magazine and in 1926 won the magazine\u2019s Guarantors\u2019 Prize, which had previously been won by Robert Frost and Edna St. Vincent Millay. Lee spent her later years in Chicago and died at home of pneumonia. She is buried in Chicago\u2019s Graceland Cemetery. A selection of letters to her from Edgar Lee Masters, an admirer, is archived in the Newberry Library in Chicago.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
