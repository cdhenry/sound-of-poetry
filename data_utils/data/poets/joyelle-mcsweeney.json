McSweeney treats words, like images, as instances of their precise contents rather than symbolic references.\u201d\n\r\nWith\u00a0Johannes G\u00f6ransson, Joyelle McSweeney cofounded\u00a0Action Books, a press that publishes poetry and books in translation. She is also the cofounder of www.actionyes.org, a web-based journal featuring international writing and hybrid forms.
