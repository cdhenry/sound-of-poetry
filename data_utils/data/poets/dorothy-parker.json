She was born two months prematurely at her family\u2019s summer home in West End, New Jersey. By the time she was five, she had lost her mother; by age 20, she had also lost her father, a garment manufacturer. She studied at Blessed Sacrament Convent School in New York City, and a finishing school, Miss Dana\u2019s, in Morristown, New Jersey, but never received a high school diploma. She supported herself as a pianist at a dance academy until entering the world of magazine publishing. \u00a0\n\u00a0After selling her first poem to\u00a0Vanity Fair\u00a0in 1914, she became a regular contributor to\u00a0Vogue. In 1917, she took over P.G. Wodehouse\u2019s role as theater\u00a0critic at Vanity Fair. That same year, she married her first husband, stockbroker Edwin P. Parker. It was an unhappy marriage and the couple divorced about a decade\u00a0later.\nWhile building a career in criticism, she was a key member of the Round Table, a group of writers who traded witticisms over lunch at the Algonquin Hotel. She was an inaugural member of the board of editors at the\u00a0New Yorker\u00a0upon its founding in 1925, and over the next decade she frequently contributed short poems to its pages.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn 1926, Parker published her first book of poetry,\u00a0Enough Rope, which became a bestseller. Her other collections include\u00a0Sunset Gun\u00a0(1928) and\u00a0Death and Taxes\u00a0(1931). Parker\u2019s poetry is marked by cleverness but also by the deep depression that plagued her. Focusing on power dynamics, especially those involving gender, her poetry\u2014sometimes dismissed as \u201clight\u201d or \u201cflapper\u201d verse\u2014pulled apart the fabric of American society. During the 1920s and early 1930s, she also published\u00a0several books of short stories.\nParker moved to Hollywood in 1934.\u00a0\u00a0There, she worked as a screenwriter on films such as\u00a0A Star Is Born\u00a0and garnered several Oscar nominations, with her second husband Alan Campbell. During that time, she was engaged in left-wing politics, raising money for progressive causes, reporting from Spain about the Civil War, and writing articles for the New Masses. She was also the national chairman of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee. Before Parker\u2019s death in 1967 at the age of 73, she specified that the bulk of her estate was to go to Martin Luther King, Jr.\u00a0 When King was assassinated less than a year later, it passed to the NAACP.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
