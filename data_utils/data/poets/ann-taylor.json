Her father was an engraver, and her mother was a writer. With her sister, Jane Taylor, she composed several volumes of children\u2019s poems, and this collaboration, coupled with Jane\u2019s early death, led to some confusion in attributing authorship to those early poems.  \u00a0 Taylor\u2019s poems are direct and simple, sometimes with layers of moral or social guidance. She is the author of the poetry collections Hymns for Infant Schools (1827) and Original Anniversary Hymns (1827) as well as the prose volume The Convalescent; Twelve Letters on Recovery from Sickness (1839). \u00a0 With her sister and other collaborators, she published Original Poems for Infant Minds (two volumes, issued in 1804 and 1805), Rhymes for the Nursery (1806), Hymns for Infant Minds (1808), and Original Hymns for Sunday Schools (1812). The sisters also revised and contributed to the volume Signor Topsy Turvy\u2019s Wonderful Magic Lantern; or, The World Turned Upside Down (1810) and contributed significantly to the anthology The Associate Minstrels (1810). The sisters are best known for their poems \u201cMy Mother\u201d and \u201cThe Star.\u201d  \u00a0 A founder of the Free Library in Nottingham, Taylor was also an active supporter of animal welfare. She is buried at Nottingham General Cemetery alongside her husband, the minister Joseph Gilbert.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
