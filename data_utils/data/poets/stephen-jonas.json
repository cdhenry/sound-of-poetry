An African American poet who was largely self-taught and heavily influenced by the work of Charles Olson, Williams Carlos Williams, and Ezra Pound, Jonas became friends with a circle of Boston poets including Jack Spicer, John Wieners, Robin Blaser, and Joe Dunn. Jonas\u2019s poetry uses phonetic spellings, rhythmic phrasing, and composition by field techniques to transcribe both the langauge and experience of the street as well as aesthetics. His poetry exhibits qualities of both Olson\u2019s \u201cprojectivist verse\u201d and Jazz, especially in long polyphonic series such as \u201cExercises for Ear,\u201d a 100-page poem described by Gerrit Lansing as\u00a0\u201cpractice on the poet\u2019s keyboard.\u201d \u00a0 Jonas\u2019s work is available in Selected Poems (1994), edited by Joseph Torra, which contains both \u201cExercises for Ear\u201d and the set of long poems \u201cOrgasms/Dominations.\u201d Jonas is also one of four poets featured in T.J. Anderson III\u2019s study of jazz poetry, Notes to Make the Sound Come Right: Four Innovators of Jazz Poetry (2004). Jonas died in 1970.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
