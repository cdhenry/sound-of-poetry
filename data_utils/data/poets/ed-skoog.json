He earned an MFA from the University of Montana. His collections of poetry include the chapbooks Toolkit (1995) and Field Recording (2003) and the full-length volumes Mister Skylight (2009) and Rough Day\u00a0(2013). Skoog\u2019s work is noted for its wild lexicon and leaping intelligence. The Harvard Review compared Skoog\u2019s work to that of Wallace Stevens and the New York School poets, noting his \u201cverbal montages.\u201d Reviewer Henry Hughes added, \u201creaders must surrender their demands for whole meaning in the narrative sense to enjoy the verbal play\u2014the sounds, phrases, and crazy connections that suggest new ways of reading the world.\u201d\nSkoog has taught at the Idyllwild Arts Foundation in Idyllwild, California, the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, and Tulane University. He has been the Jenny McKean Moore Writer in Washington at George Washington University and writer-in-residence at the Richard Hugo House.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
