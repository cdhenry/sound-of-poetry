Often focusing on the claims of nature and society on the individual, Kinnell\u2019s poems explore psychological states in precise and sonorous free verse. Critic\u00a0Morris Dickstein called Kinnell \u201cone of the true master poets of his generation.\u201d Dickstein added, \u201cthere are few others writing today in whose work we feel so strongly the full human presence.\u201d Robert Langbaum observed in the American Poetry Review that \u201cat a time when so many poets are content to be skillful and trivial, [Kinnell] speaks with a big voice about the whole of life.\u201d Marked by his early experiences as a Civil Rights and anti-war activist, Kinnell\u2019s socially-engaged verse broadened in his later years to seek the essential in human nature, often by engaging the natural and animal worlds. With a remarkable career spanning many decades, Kinnell\u2019s Selected Poems (1980) won both a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award.\n\r\nKinnell was born in 1927 in Providence, Rhode Island and grew up in Pawtucket. A self-described introvert as a child, he grew up reading reclusive American writers such as\u00a0Edgar Allan Poe and Emily Dickinson. After two years of service in the U.S. Navy, he\u00a0earned a BA with highest honors from Princeton University\u2014where he was classmates with poet\u00a0W.S. Merwin\u2014in 1948. He earned an MA from the University of Rochester a year later. Kinnell then spent many years abroad, including a Fulbright Fellowship in Paris and extended stays in Europe and the Middle East. Returning to the United States in the 1960s, Kinnell joined the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE), registering African American voters in the South. Many of his experiences\u2014world travel, city life, harassment as a member of CORE and an anti-Vietnam war demonstrator\u2014eventually found expression in his poetry. One of the first voices to mark the change in American poetry from the cerebral wit of the 1950s to the more liberated, political work of the \u201860s, Kinnell \u201cis a poet of the landscape, a poet of soliloquy, a poet of the city\u2019s underside and a poet who speaks for thieves, pushcart vendors and lumberjacks with an unforced simulation of the vernacular,\u201d noted the Hudson Review contributor Vernon Young.\n\r\nOf his first books, What a Kingdom it Was (1960), Flower Herding on Mount Monadnock (1964) and Body Rags (1968), Body Rags contains the bulk of Kinnell\u2019s most praised and anthologized poems. Using animal experiences to explore human consciousness, Kinnell poems such as \u201cThe Bear\u201d feature frank and often unlovely images. Kinnell\u2019s embrace of the ugly is well-considered, though. As the author told the Los Angeles Times, \u201cI\u2019ve tried to carry my poetry as far as I could, to dwell on the ugly as fully, as far, and as long, as I could stomach it. Probably more than most poets I have included in my work the unpleasant because I think if you are ever going to find any kind of truth to poetry it has to be based on all of experience rather than on a narrow segment of cheerful events.\u201d Though his poetry is rife with earthy images like animals, fire, blood, stars and insects, Kinnell does not consider himself to be a \u201cnature poet.\u201d In an interview with Daniela Gioseffi for Hayden\u2019s Ferry Review, Kinnell noted, \u201cI don\u2019t recognize the distinction between nature poetry and, what would be the other thing? Human civilization poetry? We are creatures of the earth who build our elaborate cities and beavers are creatures of the earth who build their elaborate lodges and canal operations and dams, just as we do \u2026 Poems about other creatures may have political and social implications for us.\u201d\n\r\nThough obsessed with a personal set of concerns and mythologies, Kinnell does draw on the tradition of both his contemporaries and predecessors. Studying the work of Theodore Roethke and Robert Lowell, Kinnell\u2019s innovations have \u201cavoided studied ambiguity, and he has risked directness of address, precision of imagery, and experiments with surrealistic situations and images\u201d according to a contributor for Contemporary Poetry. Critics most often compare Kinnell\u2019s work to that of Walt Whitman, however, because of its transcendental philosophy and personal intensity; Kinnell himself edited The Essential Whitman (1987). As Robert Langbaum observed in American Poetry Review, \u201clike the romantic poets to whose tradition he belongs, Kinnell tries to pull an immortality out of our mortality.\u201d\n\r\nOther well-known Kinnell works include The Book of Nightmares (1971) and The Avenue Bearing the Initial of Christ into the New World: Poems 1946-1964 (1974). The latter\u2019s eponymous poem explores life on Avenue C in New York City\u2019s Lower East Side, drawing inspiration from T.S. Eliot\u2019s \u201cThe Waste Land.\u201d A book-length poem that draws heavily on Rainer Maria Rilke\u2019s Duino Elegies, the ten parts of The Book of Nightmares revolve around two autobiographical moments\u2014the births of Kinnell\u2019s daughter and son\u2014while examining the relationship between society and community through a symbolic system that draws on cosmic metaphors. The book is one of Kinnell\u2019s most highly praised. Rilke was a particularly important poet for Kinnell and among his many acts as a translator, he would later co-translate The Essential Rilke (1999), with Hannah Liebmann.\n\nSelected Poems (1982), for which Kinnell won the Pulitzer Prize and was co-winner of the National Book Award in 1983, contains works from every period in the poet\u2019s career and was released just shortly before he won a prestigious MacArthur Foundation grant. Almost twenty years after his Selected Poems,\u00a0Kinnell released the retrospective collection, A New Selected Poems (2001), focusing on Kinnell\u2019s poetry of the 1960s and 1970s. His poetry from this period features a fierce surrealism that also grapples with large questions of the human, the social and the natural. In the Boston Review, Richard Tillinghast commented that Kinnell\u2019s work \u201cis proof that poems can still be written, and written movingly and convincingly, on those subjects that in any age fascinate, quicken, disturb, confound, and sadden the hearts of men and women: eros, the family, mortality, the life of the spirit, war, the life of nations \u2026 [Kinnell] always meets existence head-on, without evasion or wishful thinking. When Kinnell is at the top of his form, there is no better poet writing in America.\u201d\n\r\nKinnell\u2019s last book, Strong is Your Hold (2006) was released the year before his 80th birthday. The book, which continues the more genial, meditative stance Kinnell has developed over the years, also includes the long poem \u201cWhen the Towers Fell,\u201d written about September 11, 2001. In an interview with Elizabeth Lund for the Christian Science Monitor Online, Kinnell declared, \u201cIt\u2019s the poet\u2019s job to figure out what\u2019s happening within oneself, to figure out the connection between the self and the world, and to get it down in words that have a certain shape, that have a chance of lasting.\u201d Lund noted that \u201cKinnell never seems to lose his center, or his compassion. He can make almost any situation, any loss, resonate. Indeed, much of his work leaves the reader with a delicious ache, a sense of wanting to look once more at whatever scene is passing.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nKinnell lived in Vermont for many years, and he died in 2014 at the age of 87.\r\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
