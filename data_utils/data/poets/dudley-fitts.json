While at Harvard, he edited the Harvard Advocate. From 1958 to 1968, he judged the Yale Series of Younger Poets competition.\nFitts often formally composes his allusive lyric poems and frequently engages themes of spiritual faith and loss. He is the author of Poems 1929-1936 (1937). In The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry (1994), Martin Seymour-Smith describes Fitts\u2019s poetry as \u201csensitive, graceful, and carefully made,\u201d noting that his work was \u201cless influenced by classical models than by modern Spanish poetry.\u201d Fitts is the subject of Richard Wilbur\u2019s poem \u201cFor Dudley.\u201d\nAs a translator, Fitts is best known for his colloquial English versions of classical texts. With Robert Fitzgerald, a former student of his at the Choate School, Fitts translated Euripides\u2019s Alcestis (1936) and Sophocles\u2019s Antigone (1939) and Oedipus Rex (1948). His solo translations include One Hundred Poems from the Palatine Anthology: In English Paraphrase (1938), More Poems from the Palatine Anthology in English Paraphrase (1941), and Sixty Poems of Martial (1967) as well as several of Aristophanes\u2019s plays, including Lysistrata (1954), The Frogs (1955), The Birds (1957), and Ladies\u2019 Day (1959). Fitts also edited An Anthology of Contemporary Latin-American Poetry (1942).\nFitts taught at the Choate School and Phillips (Andover) Academy. He died at Lawrence General Hospital in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and is buried at the Phillips Academy Chapel Cemetery. A selection of his papers is held at the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale University, and an audio recording of a 1958 reading Fitts gave at Andover of his poetry and translations is archived at the Library of Congress.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
