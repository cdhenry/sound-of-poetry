She earned a BA at St. Joseph\u2019s College for Women in Brooklyn, New York, and an MA in 17th-century literature at Columbia University. On a ship to Paris after World War II, she met poet and publisher Lawrence Ferlinghetti, who later published Ponsot\u2019s debut collection through his City Lights Press.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPonsot\u2019s collections of poetry include Easy\u00a0(2009), National Book Critics Circle Award-winner and Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize finalist\u00a0The Bird Catcher\u00a0(1998),\u00a0The Green Dark\u00a0(1988), and\u00a0True Minds\u00a0(1956). Springing: New and Selected Poems (2002) was\u00a0praised by critic Harold Bloom, who proclaimed, \u201cMarie Ponsot\u2019s poetic achievement is fiercely independent. She sustained a courageous eloquence throughout her work, as she mounted up what Emerson called \u2018the stairway of surprise.\u2019\u201d\u00a0With Rosemary Deen, Ponsot co-authored\u00a0Beat Not the Poor Desk\u00a0(1982), a guide to teaching writing.\u00a0She also translated more than 30 books into English from French, including\u00a0Love & Folly: Selected Fables and Tales of La Fontaine\u00a0(2002) and the\u00a0Golden Book of Fairy Tales\u00a0(1958).\r\n\u00a0\r\nPonsot, who wrote much of her body of work while raising seven children by herself, often wrote in challenging poetic forms such as the villanelle, sestina, and tritina in poems lit by domestic and urban transformations. In a 1999 New York Times interview, Ponsot discussed her relationship to form, stating, \u201cThe forms create an almost bodily pleasure in the poet. What you\u2019re doing is trying to discover. They are not restrictive. They pull things out of you. They help you remember.\u201d Booklist reviewer Donna Seaman observed that Ponsot \u201ctoys with homonyms, elastic rhyme schemes, and paradoxes both linguistic and philosophical in her fluid and efficient poems.\u201d Regarding Ponsot\u2019s style, poet-critic Stephanie Burt has observed,\u00a0\u201cFor all its insistence on exuberance, there is something brittle, like china, about Ponsot\u2019s style. Other poets who use, as she does, short lines, a conversational pace and frequent enjambments can feel rushed or wild. Ponsot instead tends to tread slowly, as if careful not to damage the copious beauties she finds on the streets of Manhattan, in its museums, in clouds, in air.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nPonsot\u2019s honors included a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Shaughnessy Medal of the Modern Language Association, the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Prize, and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize from the Poetry Foundation. In 2010, she was elected a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. Ponsot taught at New York University and Columbia University. She lived in New York City until her death in 2019.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
