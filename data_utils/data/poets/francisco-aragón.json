He earned an MA from the University of California at Davis and an MFA from the University of Notre Dame.Exploring how language and genre both connect and diverge, Arag\u00f3n\u2019s poems locate personal experience within a wider cultural and historical conversation.

His translations appear in Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca\u2019s Selected Verse: A Bilingual Edition (1996).
