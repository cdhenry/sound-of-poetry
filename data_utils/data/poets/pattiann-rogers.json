She attended the University of Missouri, graduating Phi Beta Kappa, and went to the University of Houston where she earned an MA in creative writing. Her awards and honors also include two National Endowment for the Arts grants, a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Lannan Poetry Fellowship,\u00a0Poetry magazine's\u00a0Tietjens and Bess Hokin Prizes, the Roethke Prize from\u00a0Poetry Northwest, the Strousse Award from\u00a0Prairie Schooner, and four Pushcart Prizes. She is noted for her ability to link the natural and scientific worlds in works filled with sensual imagery, spirituality, and a sense of awe. Dictionary of Literary Biography\u00a0contributor Marsha Englebrecht writes: \u201cHer poems are fascinating bundles of flora, fauna, and scientific fact. It is impossible to ignore the precision of her observations and her commitment to her predominant, transcendentalist theme.\u201d\nIn her first book of poems,\u00a0Expectations of Light (1981),\u00a0Rogers explores the implications modern science holds for humankind\u2019s perception of itself. Writing in the\u00a0Georgia Review,\u00a0Peter Stitt calls\u00a0Expectations of Light\u00a0\u201can unusually original first book, surprising for its sophisticated incorporation of modern scientific thinking into poetry. Every poem manages somehow to present accurate knowledge of the physical universe, often in a multifaceted plethora of detail.\u201d The poems included in her 1994 collection,\u00a0Firekeeper: New and Selected Poems,\u00a0again pay attention to scientific material. As a\u00a0Publishers Weekly\u00a0contributor states, \u201cThey strongarm us with poetic gymnastics, blending scientific theory with luscious poetic rhythm.\u201d In fact, a scientific element is one of the common characteristics found throughout Rogers\u2019s poetry.\n\r\nIn a\u00a0Poetry\u00a0review of her 1997 collection\u00a0Eating Bread and Honey,\u00a0Bill Christopersen classifies Rogers among the \u201cpoets for whom there seems to exist no evil, much less anything to confess. ... They greet autobiographical materials, as well as the human predicament, frankly and movingly, but without ostentation or obsession.\u201d In a\u00a0Book\u00a0assessment of\u00a0Song of the World Becoming\u00a0(2001) Stephen Whited maintains that \u201cRogers has mastered the long meditative line that reveals the surprising beauty and mystery of the natural world.\u201d In describing Rogers\u2019s poetry, reviewer Leslie Ullman also highlights the poet\u2019s \u201csense of wonder towards multiple forms of life and energy\u201d as well as noting her \u201cunique blend of precision and propulsion, the flow and control of her long sentences, and the inclusiveness of her vision.\u201d Ullman characterizes Rogers\u2019s poems as \u201csensuous in their distinctions and inventions, their probings, and their continual delight.\u201d\nRogers talks about her approach to poetry, her inspirations, and the influence poetry has on her life in The Dream of the Marsh Wren: Writing as Reciprocal Creation (1999).\u00a0Her collections Quickening Fields (2017), Holy Heathen Rhapsody (2013), The Grand\u00a0Array (2010), Wayfare (2008), and Generations (2004) continue to explore theological possibilities as revealed through the natural world.\nRogers has been a visiting writer at the University of Texas, the University of Montana, and the University of Arkansas. She lives in Colorado.\n", "attrs": {}}
