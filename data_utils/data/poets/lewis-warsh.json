Born in the Bronx, New York, Warsh attended the City College of New York, where he earned both his BA and MA in English. Warsh started writing poetry and fiction as a teenager and published his first poems in Wild Dog Magazine in 1965.\r\n\u00a0\r\nA year later, Warsh co-founded Angel Hair magazine and books with Anne Waldman. Described by Waldman as \u201ca seed syllable that unlocked various energetic post-modern and post-New American Poetry possibilities,\u201d Angel Hair published the early work of important experimental poets such as Lee Harwood, Joe Brainard, Alice Notley, Ron Padgett, and Tom Clark. Warsh later joined a community of writers that formed around the Poetry Project at St. Mark\u2019s Church in the East Village. These included Ted Berrigan, Padgett, Brainard, George Schneeman, and Bernadette Mayer, who would later become his co-editor for United Artists Magazine and Books.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWarsh authored over 20 books of poetry, including Dreaming as One (1971), Blue Heaven (1978), Information from the Surface of Venus (1987), Out of the Question: Selected Poems (1963-2003), and Alien Abduction (2015).

He is also the author of autobiographies and fiction, including Agnes & Sally (1984), A Place in the Sun (2010), and One Foot Out the Door: Collected Stories (2014). \r\n\u00a0\r\nWarsh\u2019s awards included grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York Foundation of the Arts, the Creative Artists Public Service Foundation, the Fund for Poetry and the Poet\u2019s Foundation.
