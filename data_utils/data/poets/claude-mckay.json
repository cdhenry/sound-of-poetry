His work ranged from vernacular verse celebrating peasant life in Jamaica to poems that protested racial and economic inequities. His philosophically ambitious fiction,\u00a0including\u00a0tales of Black life in both Jamaica and America, addresses instinctual/intellectual duality, which McKay found central to the Black individual\u2019s efforts to cope in a racist society. He is the author of\u00a0The Passion of Claude McKay: Selected Poetry and Prose (1973), The Dialectic Poetry of Claude McKay (1972), Selected Poems (1953), Harlem Shadows (1922), Constab Ballads (1912), and Songs of Jamaica (1912), among many other books of poetry and prose.\nThe son of peasant farmers, McKay was infused with pride in his African heritage. His early literary interests, though, were in English poetry. Under the tutelage of his brother, schoolteacher Uriah Theophilus McKay, and a neighboring Englishman, Walter Jekyll, McKay studied the British masters\u2014including John Milton, Alexander Pope, and the later Romantics\u2014and European philosophers such as eminent pessimist Arthur Schopenhauer, whose works Jekyll was then translating from German into English. It was Jekyll who advised aspiring poet McKay to write verse in Jamaican dialect.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAt age 17, McKay departed from Sunny Ville to apprentice as a woodworker in Brown\u2019s Town. But he studied there only briefly before leaving to work as a constable in the Jamaican capital, Kingston. In Kingston he experienced and encountered extensive racism. His native Sunny Ville was predominantly Black, but in substantially white Kingston, Black people were considered inferior and capable of only menial tasks. McKay quickly grew disgusted with the city\u2019s bigoted society, and within one year he returned home to Sunny Ville.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDuring his brief stays in Brown\u2019s Town and Kingston, McKay continued writing poetry. Once back in Sunny Ville, with Jekyll\u2019s encouragement, he published the verse collections Songs of Jamaica and Constab Ballads in London in 1912. In these two volumes, McKay portrays opposing aspects of Black life in Jamaica. Songs of Jamaica presents an almost celebratory portrait of peasant life, with poems addressing subjects such as the peaceful death of McKay\u2019s mother and the Black people\u2019s ties to the Jamaican land. Constab Ballads, however, presents a substantially bleaker perspective on the plight of Black Jamaicans and contains several poems explicitly critical of life in urban Kingston.\nFor Songs of Jamaica,\u00a0McKay received an award and stipend from the Jamaican Institute of Arts and Sciences. He used the money to finance a trip to America, and in 1912, he arrived in South Carolina. He then traveled to Alabama and enrolled at the Tuskegee Institute, where he studied for approximately two months before transferring to Kansas State College. In 1914 he left school entirely for New York City and worked various menial jobs. As in Kingston, McKay encountered racism in New York City, and this compelled him to continue writing poetry.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn 1917, under the pseudonym Eli Edwards, McKay published two poems in the periodical Seven Arts. Critic Frank Hattis admired his work and included some of McKay\u2019s other poems in Pearson\u2019s Magazine. Among McKay\u2019s most famous poems from this period is \u201cTo the White Fiends,\u201d a vitriolic challenge to white oppressors and bigots. A few years later, McKay befriended Max Eastman, communist sympathizer and editor of the magazine Liberator. McKay published more poems in Eastman\u2019s magazine, notably the inspirational \u201cIf We Must Die,\u201d which defended Black rights and threatened retaliation for prejudice and abuse. \u201cLike men we\u2019ll face the murderous, cowardly pack,\u201d McKay wrote, \u201cPressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!\u201d In Black Poets of the United States, Jean Wagner noted that \u201cIf We Must Die\u201d transcends specifics of race and is widely prized as an inspiration to persecuted people throughout the world. \u201cAlong with the will to resistance of black Americans that it expresses,\u201d Wagner wrote, \u201cit voices also the will of oppressed people of every age who, whatever their race and wherever their region, are fighting with their backs against the wall to win their freedom.\u201d\nUpon publication of \u201cIf We Must Die\u201d McKay commenced two years of travel and work abroad. He spent part of 1919 in Holland and Belgium, then moved to London and worked on the periodical Workers\u2019 Dreadnought. In 1920 he published his third verse collection, Spring in New Hampshire, which was notable for containing \u201cHarlem Shadows,\u201d a poem about the plight of Black sex workers in the degrading urban environment.\nMcKay returned to the United States in 1921 and involved himself in various social causes. The next year he published Harlem Shadows, a collection from previous volumes and periodicals publications. This work contains many of his most acclaimed poems\u2014including \u201cIf We Must Die\u201d\u2014and assured his stature as a leading member of the literary movement referred to as the Harlem Renaissance. He redoubled his efforts on behalf of Blacks and laborers: he became involved in the Universal Negro Improvement Association and produced several articles for its publication, Negro World. He also traveled to the Soviet Union, where he had previously visited with Eastman, and attended the Communist Party\u2019s Fourth Congress.\r\n\u00a0\r\nEventually McKay went to Paris, where he developed a severe respiratory infection and supported himself intermittently by working as an artist\u2019s model. His infection eventually necessitated his hospitalization. After he recovered, he resumed traveling; for the next 11 years he toured Europe and portions of northern Africa. During this period he also published three novels and a short story collection. The first novel, Home to Harlem (1928), perhaps his most recognized title, concerns a Black soldier, Jake, who abruptly abandons his military duties and returns home to Harlem. Jake represents, in rather overt fashion, the instinctual aspect of the individual, and his ability to remain true to his feelings enables him to find happiness with a former sex worker, Felice. Juxtaposed with Jake\u2019s behavior is that of Ray, an aspiring writer burdened with despair. His sense of bleakness derives largely from his intellectualized perspective, and it eventually compels him to leave racist America for his homeland of Haiti.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn The Negro Novel in America, Robert Bone wrote that the predominantly instinctual Jake and the intellectual Ray \u201crepresent different ways of rebelling against Western civilization.\u201d The novel also provides a detailed portrait of Black urban life, and McKay was applauded for creating \u201ca work of vivid social realism,\u201d according to Alan L. McLeod in the Dictionary of Literary Biography. However, McKay himself \u201cstressed that he aimed at emotional realism\u2014he wanted to highlight his characters\u2019 feelings rather than their social circumstances,\u201d McLeod continued. Nevertheless, it was his glimpse into the \u201cunsavory aspects of New York black life\u201d that was prized by readers\u2014and condemned by such prominent Black leaders as W.E.B. Du Bois.\nHome to Harlem\u2014with its sordid, occasionally harrowing scenes of ghetto life\u2014proved extremely popular, and it gained recognition as the first commercially successful novel by a Black writer. McKay quickly followed it with Banjo: A Story without a Plot (1929), a novel about a Black vagabond living in the French port of Marseilles. Like Jake from Home to Harlem, protagonist Banjo embodies the largely instinctual way of living, though he is considerably more enterprising and quick-witted than the earlier character. Ray, the intellectual from Home to Harlem, also appears in Banjo. His plight is that of many struggling artists who are compelled by social circumstances to support themselves with conventional employment. Both Banjo and Ray are perpetually dissatisfied and disturbed by their limited roles in a racist society, and by the end of the novel the men are prepared to depart from Marseilles.\r\n\u00a0\nBanjo failed to match the acclaim and commercial success of Home to Harlem, but it confirmed McKay\u2019s reputation as a serious, provocative artist. \u201cIt was apparent to critics that McKay\u2019s imagination had been somewhat strained and that the novel was essentially an autobiographical exercise,\u201d McLeod remarked. Commentators have found the autobiographical thread in Home to Harlem and Banjo primarily in the character of Ray, whose peripatetic existence to some extent mirrors the author\u2019s own, as does the character\u2019s admiration for the beauty of young men\u2019s bodies. Patti Cappel Swartz digs for clues to McKay\u2019s sexuality in the author\u2019s fictional works, and points to a dream sequence in Home to Harlem and the fact that \u201cfor Ray, the bonds with men will always supersede those with women,\u201d as is shown in the conclusion of Banjo. \u201cLike McKay, Ray is not the marrying kind, but rather the vagabond who must always travel on,\u201d Swartz continued.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn his third novel, Banana Bottom, McKay presented a more incisive exploration of his principal theme, the Black individual\u2019s quest for cultural identity in the face of racism. Banana Bottom recounts the experiences of a Jamaican peasant girl, Bita, who is adopted by white missionaries after being raped. Bita\u2019s new providers try to impose their cultural values on her by introducing her to organized Christianity and the British educational system. Their actions culminate in a horribly bungled attempt to arrange Bita\u2019s marriage to an aspiring minister. The prospective groom is exposed as a sexual aberrant, whereupon Bita flees white society. She eventually marries a drayman, Jubban, and raises their child in an idealized peasant Jamaican environment. \u201cBita has pride in blackness, is free of hypocrisy, and is independent and discerning in her values,\u201d remarked McLeod. \u201cPraise for Banana Bottom has been unanimous.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nCritics agree that Banana Bottom is McKay\u2019s most skillful delineation of the Black individual\u2019s predicament. Unfortunately, the novel\u2019s thematic worth was largely ignored when the book first appeared in 1933. Positive reviews of the time were related to McKay\u2019s extraordinary evocation of the Jamaican tropics and his mastery of melodrama. In the ensuing years, though, Banana Bottom gained increasing acknowledgement as McKay\u2019s finest fiction.\nMcKay\u2019s other noteworthy fiction publication during his final years abroad was Gingertown (1932), a collection of 12 short stories. Six of the tales are devoted to Harlem life, and they reveal McKay\u2019s preoccupation with Black exploitation. Other tales are set in Jamaica and even in North Africa, McKay\u2019s last home before he returned to the United States in the mid-1930s. Once back in Harlem, he began an autobiographical work, A Long Way from Home (1937), in which he related the challenges he faced as a Black man. The book is considered unreliable as material for his autobiography because, for example, in it McKay denies his membership in the communist party, as McLeod points out. However, A Long Way from Home does state McKay\u2019s long-held belief that Black Americans should unite in the struggle against colonialism, segregation, and oppression.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBy the late 1930s, McKay had developed a keen interest in Catholicism. Through Ellen Tarry, who wrote children\u2019s books, he became active in Harlem\u2019s Friendship House. His newfound religious interest, together with his observations and experiences at the Friendship House, inspired his essay collection, Harlem: Negro Metropolis (1940), which offers an account of the Black community in Harlem during the 1920s and 1930s. Like Banjo, Banana Bottom, and Gingertown, Harlem: Negro Metropolis did not initially attract a broad readership. Critic McLeod offers a more recent evaluation of the work, the writing of which was based as much on scholarly inquiry as on personal observation, as McKay was absent from the country for a good deal of the period covered: \u201cThe book has been superseded by many more-scholarly studies, yet it retains value as a reexamination of Harlem by one who had established a necessary critical distance.\u201d\nMcKay moved to Chicago and worked as a teacher for a Catholic organization. By the mid-1940s his health had deteriorated. He endured several illnesses throughout his last years and eventually died of heart failure in 1948.\nMcKay has been recognized for his intense commitment to expressing the challenges faced by Black Americans and admired for devoting his art and life to social protest, and his audience continues to expand. McLeod concluded his essay in Dictionary of Literary Biography with the following accolades: \u201cThat he was able to capture a universality of sentiment in \u2018If We Must Die\u2019\u00a0has been fully demonstrated; that he was able to show new directions for the black novel is now acknowledged; and that he is rightly regarded as one of the harbingers of (if not one of the participants in) the Harlem Renaissance is undisputed.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Harlem Renaissance"]}}
