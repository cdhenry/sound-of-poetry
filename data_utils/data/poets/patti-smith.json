As a high school student she was interested in jazz and poetry, and her early creative works were poems. Drawn to the act of performing her work, she read her poems with a guitarist, eventually adding an entire band.\nSmith first published her poems in 1972, the same year she co-wrote a play, Cowboy Mouth, with Sam Shepard. Since then she has published a number of collections of verse, including Auguries of Innocence\u00a0(2005),\u00a0Patti Smith Complete: Lyrics, Reflections & Notes for the Future (1998), The Coral Sea (1996), Early Work, 1970\u20131979 (1994), and Babel (1978).\nSmith writes in a stream-of-consciousness style, often meditating on questions of mortality and faith. Of Auguries of Innocence, critic Donna Seaman wrote that Smith \u201cpresents lithe works unsettling in their spiritual inquiry, archetypal imagery, and dissonant juxtapositions.\u201d\nSmith has also published the widely celebrated memoirs\u00a0Year of the Monkey (2019) and Just Kids (2010), which won the National Book Award for Nonfiction.\nHailed as the \u201cgodmother of punk\u201d by the New York Times, Smith has a cultlike following. Her many albums include Banga (2012), Twelve (2007),\u00a0Gone Again (1996),\u00a0Easter (1978), Radio Ethiopia (1976), and Horses (1975). She has also been a contributor to the magazines Rolling Stone and Rock.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
