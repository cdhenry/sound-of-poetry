Although he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1907, his political views, which grew more toxic as he aged, have long made him critically unpopular. In the New Yorker, Charles McGrath remarked \u201cKipling has been variously labelled a colonialist, a jingoist, a racist, an anti-Semite, a misogynist, a right-wing imperialist warmonger; and\u2014though some scholars have argued that his views were more complicated than he is given credit for\u2014to some degree he really was all those things. That he was also a prodigiously gifted writer who created works of inarguable greatness hardly matters anymore, at least not in many classrooms, where Kipling remains politically toxic.\u201d However, Kipling\u2019s works for children, above all his novel The Jungle Book, first published in 1894, remain part of popular cultural through the many movie versions made and remade since the 1960s.\nKipling was born in Bombay, India, in 1865. His father, John Lockwood Kipling, was principal of the Jeejeebyhoy School of Art, an architect and artist who had come to the colony, writes Charles Cantalupo in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, \u201cto encourage, support, and restore native Indian art against the incursions of British business interests.\u201d He meant to try, Cantalupo continues, \u201cto preserve, at least in part, and to copy styles of art and architecture which, representing a rich and continuous tradition of thousands of years, were suddenly threatened with extinction.\u201d His mother, Alice Macdonald, had connections through her sister\u2019s marriage to the artist Sir Edward Burne-Jones with important members of the Pre-Raphaelite movement in British arts and letters.\n\r\nKipling spent the first years of his life in India, remembering it in later years as almost a paradise. \u201cMy first impression,\u201d he wrote in his posthumously published autobiography Something of Myself for My Friends Known and Unknown, \u201cis of daybreak, light and colour and golden and purple fruits at the level of my shoulder.\u201d In 1871, however, his parents sent him and his sister Beatrice\u2014called \u201cTrix\u201d\u2014to England, partly to avoid health problems, but also so that the children could begin their schooling. Kipling and his sister were placed with the widow of an old Navy captain named Holloway at a boarding house called Lorne Lodge in Southsea, a suburb of Portsmouth. Kipling and Trix spent the better part of the next six years in that place, which they came to call the \u201cHouse of Desolation.\u201d\n\r\n1871 until 1877 were miserable years for Kipling. \u201cIn addition to feelings of bewilderment and abandonment\u201d from being deserted by his parents, writes Mary A. O\u2019Toole in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, \u201cKipling had to suffer bullying by the woman of the house and her son.\u201d Kipling may have brought some of this treatment on himself\u2014he was a formidably aggressive and pampered child. He once stamped down a quiet country road shouting: \u201cOut of the way, out of the way, there\u2019s an angry Ruddy coming!,\u201d reports J.I.M. Stewart in his biography Rudyard Kipling, which led an aunt to reflect that \u201cthe wretched disturbances one ill-ordered child can make is a lesson for all time to me.\u201d In Something of Myself, however, he recounted punishments that went far beyond correction. \u201cI had never heard of Hell,\u201d he wrote, \u201cso I was introduced to it in all its terrors. \u2026 Myself I was regularly beaten.\u201d On one occasion, after having thrown away a bad report card rather than bring it home, \u201cI was well beaten and sent to school through the streets of Southsea with the placard \u2018Liar\u2019 between my shoulders.\u201d At last, Kipling suffered a sort of nervous breakdown. An examination showed that he badly needed glasses\u2014which helped explain his poor performance in school\u2014and his mother returned from India to care for him. \u201cShe told me afterwards,\u201d Kipling stated in Something of Myself, \u201cthat when she first came up to my room to kiss me good-night, I flung up an arm to guard off the cuff that I had been trained to expect.\u201d\n\r\nKipling did have some happy times during those years. He and his sister spent each December time with his mother\u2019s sister, Lady Burne-Jones, at The Grange, a meeting-place frequented by English artisans such as William Morris\u2014or \u201cour Deputy \u2018Uncle Topsy\u2019\u201d as Kipling called him in Something of Myself. Sir Edward Burne-Jones occasionally entered into the children\u2019s play, Kipling recalled: \u201cOnce he descended in broad daylight with a tube of \u2018Mummy Brown\u2019 [paint] in his hand, saying that he had discovered it was made of dead Pharaohs and we must bury it accordingly. So we all went out and helped\u2014according to the rites of Mizraim and Memphis, I hope\u2014and\u2014to this day I could drive a spade within a foot of where that tube lies.\u201d \u201cBut on a certain day\u2014one tried to fend off the thought of it\u2014the delicious dream would end,\u201d he concluded, \u201cand one would return to the House of Desolation, and for the next two or three mornings there cry on waking up.\u201d\n\r\nIn 1878, Kipling was sent off to school in Devon, in the west of England. The institution was the United Services College, a relatively new school intended to educate the sons of army officers, and Kipling was probably sent there because the headmaster was one Cormell Price, \u201cone of my Deputy-Uncles at The Grange \u2026 \u2018Uncle Crom.\u2019\u201d There Kipling formed three close friends, whom he later immortalized in his collection of stories Stalky Co, published in 1899. \u201cWe fought among ourselves \u2018regular an\u2019 faithful as man an\u2019 wife,\u2019\u201d Kipling reported in Something of Myself, \u201cbut any debt which we owed elsewhere was faithfully paid by all three of us.\u201d \u201cI must have been \u2018nursed\u2019 with care by Crom and under his orders,\u201d Kipling recalled. \u201cHence, when he saw I was irretrievably committed to the ink-pot, his order that I should edit the School Paper and have the run of his Library Study. \u2026 Heaven forgive me! I thought these privileges were due to my transcendent personal merits.\u201d\n\r\nSince his parents could not afford to send him to one of the major English universities, in 1882 Kipling left the Services College, bound for India to rejoin his family and to begin a career as a journalist. For five years he held the post of assistant editor of the Civil and Military Gazette at Lahore. During those years he also published the stories that became Plain Tales from the Hills, works based on British lives in the resort town of Simla, and Departmental Ditties, his first major collection of poems. In 1888, the young journalist moved south to join the Allahabad Pioneer, a much larger publication. At the same time, his works had begun to be published in cheap editions intended for sale in railroad terminals, and he began to earn a strong popular following with collections such as The Phantom \u2018Rickshaw and Other Tales, The Story of the Gadsbys, Soldiers Three, Under the Deodars, and \u201cWee Willie Winkie\u201d and Other Child Stories. In March 1889 Kipling left India to return to England, determined to pursue his future as a writer there.\n\r\nThe young writer\u2019s reputation soared after he settled in London. \u201cKipling\u2019s official biographer, C.E. Carrington,\u201d declares Cantalupo, \u201ccalls 1890 \u2018Rudyard Kipling\u2019s year. There had been nothing like his sudden rise to fame since Byron.\u2019\u201d \u201cHis poems and stories,\u201d writes O\u2019Toole, \u201celicited strong reactions of love and hate from the start\u2014almost none of his advocates and detractors were temperate in praise or in blame. Ordinary readers liked the rhythms, the cockney speech, and the imperialist sentiments of his poems and short stories; critics generally damned the works for the same reasons.\u201d Many of his works were originally published in periodicals and later collected in various editions as Barrack-Room Ballads; famous poems such as \u201cThe Ballad of East and West,\u201d\u201cDanny Deever,\u201d \u201cTommy,\u201d and \u201cThe Road to Mandalay\u201d date from this time.\n\r\nKipling\u2019s literary life in London brought him to the attention of many people. One of them was a young American publisher named Wolcott Balestier, who became friends with Kipling and persuaded him to work on a collaborative novel. The result, writes O\u2019Toole, entitled The Naulahka, \u201creads more like one of Kipling\u2019s travel books than like a novel\u201d and \u201cseems rather hastily and opportunistically concocted.\u201d It was not a success. Balestier himself did not live to see the book published\u2014he died on December 6, 1891\u2014but he influenced Kipling strongly in another way. Kipling married Balestier\u2019s sister, Caroline, in January, 1892, and the couple settled near their family home in Brattleboro, Vermont.\n\r\nThe Kiplings lived in America for several years, in a house they built for themselves and called \u201cNaulahka.\u201d Kipling developed a close friendship with Theodore Roosevelt, then Under Secretary of the Navy, and often discussed politics and culture with him. \u201cI liked him from the first,\u201d Kipling recalled in Something of Myself, \u201cand largely believed in him. \u2026 My own idea of him was that he was a much bigger man than his people understood or, at that time, knew how to use, and that he and they might have been better off had he been born twenty years later.\u201d Both of Kipling\u2019s daughters were born in Vermont\u2014Josephine late in 1892, and Elsie in 1894\u2014as was one of the classic works of juvenile literature: The Jungle Books, which are ranked among Kipling\u2019s best works. The adventures of Mowgli, the foundling child raised by wolves in the Seeonee Hills of India, are \u201cthe cornerstones of Kipling\u2019s reputation as a children\u2019s writer,\u201d declared William Blackburn in Writers for Children, \u201cand still among the most popular of all his works.\u201d The Mowgli stories and other, unrelated works from the collection\u2014such as \u201cRikki-Tikki-Tavi\u201d and \u201cThe White Seal\u201d\u2014have often been filmed and adapted into other media.\n\r\nIn Something of Myself, Kipling traced the origins of these stories to a book he had read when he was young \u201cabout a lion-hunter in South Africa who fell among lions who were all Freemasons, and with them entered into a confederacy against some wicked baboons.\u201d Martin Seymour-Smith, writing in Rudyard Kipling: A Biography, identifies another of the major sources as \u201cthe Jataka tales of India. Some of these fables go back as early as the fourth century BC and incorporate material of even earlier eras. One version, Jatakamala, was composed in about 200 AD by the poet Aryasura. They are Buddhist birth-stories\u2014Jatakamala means \u2018Garland of Birth Stories\u2019\u2014which the 19th-century scholar Rhys Davids described as \u2018the most important collection of ancient folk-lore extant.\u2019 Each of the 550 stories tells of the Buddha in some previous incarnation, and each is a story of the past occasioned by some incident in the present. \u2026 Some of the beast fables resemble Aesop\u2019s, but the Jataka tales are more deliberately brutal. They teach not merely that men should be more tender towards animals, but the equivalence of all life.\u201d\n\r\nThe Kiplings left Vermont in 1896 after a fierce quarrel with Beatty Balestier, Kipling\u2019s surviving brother-in-law. The writer\u2019s unwillingness to be interviewed made him unpopular with the American press, and he was savagely ridiculed when the facts of the case became public. Rather than remain in America, Kipling and his wife returned to England, settling for a time in Rottingdean, Sussex, near the home of Kipling\u2019s parents. The writer soon published another novel, drawing on his knowledge of New England life: Captains Courageous, the story of Harvey Cheney, a spoiled young man who is washed overboard while on his way to Europe and is rescued by fishermen. Cheney spends the summer learning about human nature and self-discipline. \u201cAfter the ship has docked in Gloucester and Harvey\u2019s parents have come to take him home,\u201d explains O\u2019Toole, \u201chis father, a self-made man, is pleased to see that his son has grown from a snobbish boy to a self-reliant young man who has learned how to make his own way through hard work and to judge people by their own merits rather than by their bank balances.\u201d\n\r\nThe Kiplings returned to America on several occasions, but this practice ended in 1899 when the whole family came down with pneumonia and Josephine, his eldest daughter, died from it. She had been, writes Seymour-Smith, \u201cby all accounts \u2026 \u00a0unusually lively, witty and enchanting,\u201d and her loss was deeply felt. Kipling sought solace in his work. In 1901 he published what many critics believe is his finest novel: Kim, the story of an orphaned Irish boy who grows up in the streets of Lahore, is educated at the expense of his father\u2019s old Army regiment, and enters into \u201cthe Great Game,\u201d the \u201ccold war\u201d of espionage and counter-espionage on the borders of India between Great Britain and Russia in the late 19th century. In many ways, Kipling suggested in Something of Myself, the book was a collaboration between himself and his father: \u201cHe would take no sort of credit for any of his suggestions, memories or confirmations,\u201d the writer recalled, but \u201cthere was a good deal of beauty in it, and not a little wisdom; the best in both sorts being owed to my Father.\u201d \u201cThe glory of Kim,\u201d declares O\u2019Toole, \u201clies not in its plot nor in its characters but in its evocation of the complex Indian scene. The great diversity of the land\u2014its castes; its sects; its geographical, linguistic, and religious divisions; its numberless superstitions; its kaleidoscopic sights, sounds, colors, and smells\u2014are brilliantly and lovingly evoked.\u201d\n\r\nIn 1902 the Kiplings settled in their permanent home, a 17th-century house called \u201cBateman\u2019s\u201d in East Sussex. \u201cIn the years following the move,\u201d O\u2019Toole explains, \u201cKipling for the most part turned away from the types of stories he had written early in his career and explored new subjects and techniques.\u201d One example, completed before the Kiplings occupied Bateman\u2019s, was the collection called the Just So Stories, perhaps Kipling\u2019s best-remembered and best-loved work. The stories, written for his own children and intended to be read aloud, deal with the beginnings of things: \u201cHow the Camel Got His Hump,\u201d \u201cThe Elephant\u2019s Child,\u201d \u201cThe Sing-Song of Old Man Kangaroo,\u201d \u201cThe Cat That Walked by Himself,\u201d and many others. In these works, Kipling painted rich, vivid word-pictures that honor and at the same time parody the language of traditional Eastern stories such as the Jataka tales and the Thousand and One Arabian Nights. \u201cIn no other collection of children\u2019s stories,\u201d writes Elisabeth R. Choi in her foreword to the 1978 Crown edition of the Just So Stories, \u201cis there such fanciful and playful language.\u201d\n\r\nThe area around Bateman\u2019s, rich in English history, inspired Kipling\u2019s last works for children, Puck of Pook\u2019s Hill and its sequel, Rewards and Fairies. The main sources of their inspiration, Kipling explained in Something of Myself, came from artifacts discovered in a well they were drilling on the property: \u201cWhen we stopped at twenty-five feet, we had found a Jacobean tobacco-pipe, a worn Cromwellian latten spoon and, at the bottom of all, the bronze cheek of a Roman horse-bit.\u201d At the bottom of a drained pond, they \u201cdredged two intact Elizabethan \u2018sealed quarts\u2019 \u2026 all pearly with the patina of centuries. Its deepest mud yielded us a perfectly polished Neolithic axe-head with but one chip on its still venomous edge.\u201d From these artifacts\u2014and a suggestion made by a cousin, the ruins of an ancient forge, and the playing of his children\u2014Kipling constructed a series of related stories of how Dan and Una come to meet Puck, the last remaining Old Thing in England, and from him learn the history of their land.\n\r\nKipling wrote many other works during the periods that he produced his children\u2019s classics. He was actively involved in the Boer War in South Africa as a war correspondent, and in 1917 he was assigned the post of \u201cHonorary Literary Advisor\u201d to the Imperial War Graves Commission\u2014the same year that his son John, who had been missing in action for two years, was confirmed dead. In his last years, explains O\u2019Toole, he became even more withdrawn and bitter, losing much of his audience because of his unpopular political views\u2014such as compulsory military service\u2014and a \u201ccruelty and desire for vengeance [in his writings] that his detractors detested.\u201d Modern critical opinions, O\u2019Toole continues, \u201care contradictory because Kipling was a man of contradictions. He had enormous sympathy for the lower classes \u2026 yet distrusted all forms of democratic government.\u201d He declined awards offered him by his own government, yet accepted others from foreign nations. He finally succumbed to a painful illness early in 1936.\nAdditional insight on Kipling\u2019s life, career, and views can be gleaned from the three volumes of The Letters of Rudyard Kipling. The volumes contain selected surviving letters written by Kipling between 1872 and 1910; it is believed that both Kipling and his wife destroyed many of Kipling\u2019s other letters. Kipling\u2019s chief correspondent was Edmonia Hill, who was his counselor and confidante beginning during his days as a journalist in India. Reviewers note that all of the letters reflect Kipling\u2019s distinctive literary style. Jonathan Keates in the Observer wrote, \u201cthis gathering of survivors shows that Kipling, with his gift for the resonant, throat-grabbing phrase and his obsessive interest in watching and listening, could never write a dud letter.\u201d John Bayley points out in the Times Literary Supplement: \u201c[Kipling] wrote his letters, as he did his stories and early sketches, in an amalgam of Wardour Street and schoolboyese, with biblical overtones, often transposed into a sort of Anglo-Indian syntax. \u2026 Kipling is inimitable: at his innocently aesthetic worst, he can be deeply embarrassing; and the letters, like the stories, contain both sorts.\u201d Writing in the Observer, Amit Chaudhuri remarks that the third volume of letters reveals \u201cthe contractions of a unique writer; a loving father and husband who was also deeply interested in the asocial, predominantly male pursuit of Empire; a conservative who succumbed to the romance of the new technology [the automobile]; an apologist for England for whom England was, in a fundamental and positive way, a \u2018foreign country.\u2019\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Asia, South", "England"], "School/Period:": ["Victorian"]}}
