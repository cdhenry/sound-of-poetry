It's partly my own testimony as an Indigenous individual in this country. It's the testimony of my auntie, who cannot speak. It's the testimony of my mother, who cannot speak. It's the testimony of generations of my family that were left voiceless. It's also a ceremony of those things, of bringing the names together, of talking about the things that each of us witness.\u201d\nScofield is the author of the acclaimed memoir Thunder Through My Veins (1999) and was the subject of the feature-length documentary Singing Home the Bones: A Poet Becomes Himself (2007). He has been writer-in-residence at the University of Manitoba and Memorial University of Newfoundland.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Canada"]}}
