His first collection of poetry, The Evolution of the Flightless Bird (1984), received the Yale Younger Poets Prize. The book\u2019s formal ambitiousness and technical facility, including an extended sonnet sequence, presaged Kenney\u2019s future work, which has won accolades for its deft use of traditional forms and themes as well as its originality of voice. \u201cSuch poetry is not afraid of having intellect, or requiring it,\u201d asserted William Logan in the New York Times Book Review, reviewing Kenney\u2019s debut.\nKenney\u2019s second book, Orrery (1985), took its name from an 18th-century device used to display the movements of the solar system. The work features sonnets devoted to physics, memory, and time, as well as a sequence set on an apple cider farm in present-day Vermont. Poet-critic J.D. McClatchy hailed Kenney as \u201ca poet with large ambitions\u201d with \u201cthe talent to fulfill them.\u201d Kenney\u2019s third book, The Invention of the Zero (1993), likewise garnered praise for its intricacy and profound commitment to craft. \u201cWhat first impresses is Kenney\u2019s language,\u201d noted Christopher Merrill in the Los Angeles Times, \u201cwhich is at once gorgeous, exact and difficult to penetrate.\u201d Speaking to a Seattle newspaper, Kenney noted that The Invention of the Zero had been an obsessive, exacting effort: \u201cIt didn\u2019t begin as a pretentious book, but I got in over my head, both intellectually and technically. That book ended up being a good way to alienate anyone who thought they liked my previous work. I stand by the book, but do not expect people to like\u00a0it.\u201d\nDuring the 1980s and \u201990s Kenney received a number of prestigious awards, including the Lannan Award, the Rome Prize in Literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and a fellowship from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.\nA 15-year silence punctuates Kenney\u2019s later career. In 2008 he published The\u00a0One-Strand River: Poems 1994\u20132007, which\u00a0includes an astonishing range, variety, and number of poems\u2014the collection is over 150 pages long. Writing in the Iowa Review, poet Tod Marshall declared, \u201cthis book feels and reads like a book of poems\u2014tradition and the sense of a life lived in our world are touchstone throughout. And yet, frequently, the diction, the syntactical gymnastics, the sheer original limberness with language demand that we tune in, pay attention.\u201d In 2019, Random House published Terminator: Poems 2008\u20132018. Reviewer Jason Whitmarsh praised this collection in Poetry Northwest: \u201cKenney\u2019s work is as alive and thrilling and fully human as anything I\u2019ve read. It\u2019s the result of an extraordinarily curious mind and a world that is deeply felt\u2014and it somehow includes us in that mind and in that experience. I read these poems and I see and think and (most astonishing of all)\u00a0feel\u00a0more acutely.\u201d\nKenney is the Grace M. Pollock Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Washington, where he teaches in the MFA program. He lives with his family in Port Townsend, Washington.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
