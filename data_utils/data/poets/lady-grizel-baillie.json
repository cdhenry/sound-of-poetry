At age 12, she smuggled letters from her father to the imprisoned patriot Robert Baillie of Jerviswood. Sir Hume publicly defended Baillie, and after Baillie\u2019s execution, Sir Hume\u2019s castle was confiscated, forcing Sir Hume into hiding in a vault beneath Polwarth Church in Edinburgh. The family later fled to Holland, finally returning to Scotland to participate in the \u201cGlorious Revolution\u201d of 1688. In 1692, Grizel Hume married Robert Baillie\u2019s son George, and in 1696, Sir Hume was made Lord Chancellor of Scotland. \u00a0 Lady Grizel\u2019s verses bear mournful witness to suffering. Only two of Lady Grizel\u2019s songs survive: \u201cThe ewe-butchin\u2019s bonnie,\u201d which may have been inspired by her father\u2019s ordeal, and \u201cWerena my Heart\u2019s licht I wad dee,\u201d which appeared in the Scottish folk song collection Orpheus Caledonius (1725) and in volume 4 of Tea Table Miscellany (1724-37). \u00a0 The Household Book of Lady Grisell Baillie 1692-1733 (1911) offers a detailed portrait of domestic expenditures and daily life at a Scottish country house. Lady Grizel Baillie is buried on the grounds of Mellerstain House, her home in the final decades of her life. The handheld wooden lantern the young Lady Grizel took on nightly visits to her father is now in the collections of the National Museums Scotland.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Scotland"]}}
