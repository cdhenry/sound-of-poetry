Praised for his stylish elegance, moral sensibilities, and transformation of autobiographical moments into deep and complex meditations, Merrill\u2019s work spans genres\u2014including plays and prose\u2014but the bulk of his artistic expression can be found in his poetry. Over the long course of his career, Merrill won nearly every major literary award in America: he received two National Book Awards, for Nights and Days (1966) and Mirabell: Books of Numbers (1978); Merrill\u2019s long Ouija-inspired epic poem The Changing Light at Sandover (1982) won the National Book Critics Circle Award, and he was awarded the inaugural Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry by the Library of Congress for his book The Inner Room (1988); he also received both the Bollingen Prize in Poetry and the Pulitzer Prize, the latter for a book of occult poetry called Divine Comedies (1976).\nMerrill was born in 1926 in New York City, the son of investment banker Charles E. Merrill, co-founder of the Merrill Lynch brokerage firm. Brought up in fabulous wealth, Merrill\u2019s interest in language was piqued by his governess\u2014a Prussian-English widow called Mademoiselle who was fluent in both German and French. Merrill\u2019s first book of poems was privately printed by his father during his senior year of high school. Merrill attended Amherst College; though his education was interrupted by a stint in the U.S. army during World War II, Merrill\u2019s future as a poet was all but decided during his years in college. In 1946 he published his first collection, The Black Swan. Spending a few years traveling abroad in Europe after graduating, Merrill eventually settled in Stonington, Connecticut with his long-term partner, the writer David Jackson. Though Merrill was wealthy his entire life, he understood the plight of many artists and founded the Ingram Merrill Foundation in 1956, a permanent endowment created for writers and painters.\n\r\nWhile at Amherst, Merrill wrote his thesis on Marcel Proust, and in many ways the great French writer\u2019s themes of memory, nostalgia, and loss became Merrill\u2019s own. The fusion of autobiography and archetype was a hallmark of Merrill\u2019s verse. David Kalstone explained in the Times Literary Supplement that Merrill\u2019s relatively privileged existence allowed him to focus intensely on the poetic act itself: \u201cHe [Merrill] has not led the kind of outwardly dramatic life which would make external changes the centre of his poetry. Instead, poetry itself has been one of the changes, something which continually happens to him, and Merrill\u2019s subject proves to be the subject of the great Romantics: the constant revisions of the self that come through writing verse. Each book seems more spacious because of the one which has come before.\u201d Though centered on the self, Helen Vendler observed in the New York Times Book Review that the best of Merrill\u2019s poems \u201care autobiographical without being \u2018confessional\u2019: they show none of that urgency to reveal the untellable or unspeakable that we associate with the poetry we call \u2018confessional\u2019.\u201d\n\r\nA master of forms, Merrill\u2019s later poetry rarely feels formal. In the Atlantic Monthly, poet X.J. Kennedy observed that \u201cMerrill never sprawls, never flails about, never strikes postures. Intuitively he knows that, as Yeats once pointed out, in poetry, \u2018all that is personal soon rots; it must be packed in ice or salt.\u2019\u201d Comparisons to W.B. Yeats recurred throughout Merrill\u2019s career, particularly during the periods in which Merrill wrote Divine Comedies and his master-work, The Changing Light at Sandover. Embracing mysticism and the occult, Merrill believed, like Yeats\u2014whose wife was a medium\u2014that he received inspiration from the world beyond. His Divine Comedies features an affable ghost named Ephraim who instructs the poet; Yeats\u2019s \u201cA Vision\u201d features the spirit Leo Africanus in a similar role. Critics have found other influences at work in Merrill\u2019s poems as well, drawing parallels between his writing and the work of Dante, W.H. Auden, and Marcel Proust\u2014who was also dismissed as a mere aesthete early in his career.\n\r\nMerrill\u2019s early work, in First Poems (1951) and The Country of a Thousand Years of Peace and Other Poems (1959), was criticized for its insistence on \u201cconnoisseurish aesthetic contemplation,\u201d in the words of James Dickey. In the 1960s Merrill began to incorporate more autobiographical and personal elements into his work, leading to \u201ca toughened and colloquialized \u2026 verse line\u201d according to Ian Hamilton in the Washington Post Book World. With each step he took away from formalism, Merrill gained critical ground. As his verse became more conversational, it began to mimic the structures of prose, as Vendler noted in the New York Review of Books: \u201cThe flashes and glimpses of \u2018plot\u2019 in some of the lyrics\u2014especially the longer poems\u2014reminded Merrill\u2019s readers that he wanted more than the usual proportion of dailiness and detail in his lyrics, while preserving a language far from the plainness of journalistic poetry, a language full of arabesques, fancifulness, play of wit, and oblique metaphor.\u201d In fact, Merrill considered writing his epic poem \u201cThe Book of Ephraim\u201d as a prose narrative, though he eventually abandoned the idea. \u201cThe Book of Ephraim\u201d\u2014which appeared in Divine Comedies, considered to be Merrill\u2019s breakthrough\u2014prompted many critics to reevaluate the poet. Among them was Harold Bloom, who wrote in the New Republic that \u201cthe book\u2019s eight shorter poems surpass nearly all the earlier Merrill, but its apocalypse (a lesser word won\u2019t do) is a 100-page verse-tale, \u2018The Book of Ephraim,\u2019 an occult splendor in which Merrill rivals Yeats\u2019 \u2018A Vision,\u2019\u2026 and even some aspects of Proust.\u201d\n\r\nThe two volumes that followed Divine Comedies, Mirabell: Books of Number (1978) and Scripts for the Pageant (1980), continue the narrative that \u201cThe Book of Ephraim\u201d begins. Together these three poems form a trilogy that was published with a new coda in The Changing Light at Sandover, an unprecedented 560-page epic that records the Ouija board sessions Merrill and David Jackson conducted with spirits from the other world. Merrill organized each section of the trilogy to reflect a different component of their homemade Ouija board. The twenty-six sections of \u201cThe Book of Ephraim\u201d correspond to the board\u2019s A to Z alphabet, the ten sections of Mirabell: Books of Number correspond to the board\u2019s numbering from zero to nine, and the three sections of Scripts for the Pageant (\u201cYes,\u201d \u201c&,\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d) correspond to the board\u2019s Yes & No. The progression of poems also represents a kind of celestial hierarchy, with each book representing communication with a higher order of spirits than the one before. Humans in the poem are identified by their initials\u2014DJ and JM; spirits speak in all capitals. By the time Merrill transcribed the lessons of the archangels in book three, he offered nothing less than a model of the universe. According to Mary Jo Salter in the Atlantic Monthly, the long poem is \u201ca hymn celebrating, among other things, \u2018resistance\u2019 as \u2018Nature\u2019s gift to man.\u2019\u201d As the myth is reappraised and corrected by the characters who are themselves a part of it, Salter believed that \u201c\u2018Yes No\u2019 becomes an answer to every question: not an equivocation of authorial (or divine) responsibility, but an acknowledgment that \u2018fact is fable,\u2019 that the question of man\u2019s future, if any, is one he must answer for himself.\u201d\n\r\nJames Merrill died of a heart attack in February of 1995 while vacationing in Tucson, Arizona. He continued to write poetry and prose until his death, often treating, in subtle ways, the AIDS epidemic that ravaged his friend group, and to which he himself succumbed. Merrill published a memoir, A Different Person, in 1993; his final volume of poetry, A Scattering of Salts (1995), \u201cprovides an elegant closure for his life\u2019s work, the kind of bittersweet ending he treasured,\u201d remarked Phoebe Pettingell in The New Leader. Other posthumous volumes followed, including Collected Poems (2001) and Selected Poems (2008), both edited by J.D. McClatchy and Stephen Yenser. Collected Poems is the first in a series that will present all of Merrill\u2019s work, including his novels, plays, and collected prose. It includes his entire body of poetry excluding juvenilia and The Changing Light at Sandover. In addition, Collected Poems brings together for the first time 21 translations from Apollinaire, Montale, Cavafy, and others and 44 previously uncollected poems, including elegies to Philip Larkin, Elizabeth Bishop, and others. Selected Poems does excerpt The Changing Light at Sandover, presenting a sampler of a poet who wrote \u201cNew Critical Rococo\u201d in the words of August Kleinzhaler in the New York Times Book Review. Kleinzhaler added: \u201cWhere a straight line would do, Merrill cannot resist using filigree. But if one were to bypass his work, one would be missing some of the finest poems written in English in the middle of last century.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\n\r\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
