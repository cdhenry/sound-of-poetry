One of the first widely celebrated M\u0101ori poets, Tuwhare used a conversational tone to examine M\u0101ori and biblical narratives and the beauty of nature. He is the author of No Ordinary Sun (1964), Come Rain Hail (1970), Sap-wood & Milk (1970), Shape-Shifter (1997), and Piggy-Back Moon (2001), among other books. In a review of his work, Peter Kitchin wrote, \u201cHis deft constructions and a seemingly bottomless drawer of observations, both charitable and pointed, are hallmarks of his style. ... His work is also distinctive because almost without exception, the works are individually addressed, whether to people, ideas, objects or events.\u201d\nTuwhare organized the first M\u0101ori Writers and Artists Conference in 1973. He received a Robert Burns Fellowship at the University of Otago and a Montana New Zealand Book Award and was poet laureate of New Zealand from 1999 to 2000. Tuwhare received the inaugural Prime Minister\u2019s Award for Literary Achievement in 2003.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Pacific Islands"]}}
