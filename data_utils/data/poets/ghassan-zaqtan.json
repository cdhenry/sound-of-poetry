Speaking through a translator in an interview with PBS\u2019s Jeffrey Brown, Zaqtan addressed the significance of memory in his work, noting, \u201cFor this uncertain place, for uncertain life, which we have in this area, we have to protect our personal history. A complete people has lost its future, has lost the location, has lost its place. And, obviously, poetry is one of the most expressive forms in order to reach the people. This is why the poets were the first to remind these people of their identity.\u201d Describing Zaqtan as \u201ca lyricist with strong narrative impulse,\u201d Joudah said of his work, \u201cIn his poems he sketches or carves psychological portraits that surpass the finalities and categories of consumed or consumerist analysis.\u201d\nA supporter of the Palestinian resistance movement, Zaqtan has edited the Palestine Liberation Organization\u2019s literary magazine, Bayader, as well as the poetry journal Al-Soua\u2019ra and the literary page of the Ramallah newspaper Al-Ayyam. Founding director of the House of Poetry in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Zaqtan has also served as director general of the Palestinian Ministry of Culture\u2019s Literature and Publishing Department. He lives in Ramallah.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Middle East"]}}
