She studied at Sacramento State University and the University of California at Berkeley.\u00a0She is the author of numerous collections of poetry, including Personal Volcano (2019), Verne & Lemurian Objects (2017),\u00a0The Fugitive Notebook (2014),\u00a0Who That Divines (2014),\u00a0A Tonalist (2010), A Semblance: Selected and New Poems, 1975\u20132007, and Rondeaux (1990). She is also the author of the science fiction novel Ultravioleta (2006) and the short novel Cunning (2000).\nIn her work, Moriarty engages language and feminism; the poems buckle and fold against the constraints of hybrid, projectivist, and received forms. Observing the influence of poets Robert Duncan and Norma Cole on Moriarty\u2019s work in a 2007 review of A Semblance for Publishers Weekly, the reviewer noted, \u201c[Moriarty] has the former\u2019s baroquely elegant turns of mind and the latter's searching fluidity, but her subject matter\u2014roughly, how one\u2019s self-perceptions form a language that one is always comparing to one's experiences\u2014is all her own, and her lines have a tensile gorgeousness unlike anyone else\u2019s.\u201d\nMoriarty has served as archive director for the Poetry Center and American Poetry Archives at San Francisco State University and as deputy director of Small Press Distribution. She has taught at Naropa University, the Otis Art Institute, and Mills College. Her honors include a Poetry Center Book Award, a Wallace Alexander Gerbode Foundation Award in Poetry, a New Langton Arts Award, and a Fund for Poetry grant. She lives in northern California.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
