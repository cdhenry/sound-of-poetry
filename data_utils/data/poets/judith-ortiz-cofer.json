When she was a young child her father\u2019s military career took the family to Paterson, New Jersey, and\u00a0much of her childhood was spent traveling back and forth between Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland. At 15, her family moved again, this time to Augusta, Georgia, where she eventually earned a BA in English from Augusta College. She later earned an MA in English from Florida Atlantic University and did graduate work at Oxford University.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAlthough Ortiz Cofer is best known for her works of creative nonfiction, she began her writing career with poetry, which she felt \u201ccontains the essence of language.\u201d Her early chapbook Peregrina (1986) won the Riverstone International Chapbook Competition, and she\u00a0published various other collections of poetry, including Terms of Survival (1987), Reaching for the Mainland (1995), and A Love Story Beginning in Spanish (2005). \r\n\u00a0\r\nOrtiz Cofer\u2019s work explores the rifts and gaps that arise between her split cultural heritages. Her early immersion in both Puerto Rican and American culture\u00a0shaped her multi-genre approach, which includes works of fiction, prose, poetry, and sometimes a combination of the three. Her work The Latin Deli, which was nominated for a Pulitzer-Prize, explores various genres, combining poetry, short fiction, and personal narrative.\u00a0 She\u00a0was also an author of children\u2019s books.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn 2010, Ortiz Cofer was inducted into the Georgia Writers Hall of Fame. Her awards include grants from the Witter Bynner Foundation and the Georgia Council for the Arts, as well as fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts for poetry, the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference, and the Florida Fine Arts Council.\u00a0She died in December 2016.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Caribbean"]}}
