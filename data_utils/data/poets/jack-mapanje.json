He earned a BA from the University of Malawi before moving to England, where he earned an MPhil in English and education from the Institute of Education, University of London, and a PhD in linguistics from University College London. With dry wit and a spiraling narrative structure that incorporates techniques of Malawi\u2019s oral storytelling tradition, Mapanje\u2019s poems examine exile, imprisonment, and political power.  \u00a0 In 1975, Mapanje returned to Malawi to teach English at Chancellor College, University of Malawi, where he eventually became head of the Department of English. In 1981, he published his first book, Of Chameleons and Gods, which the Malawi government subsequently banned. This led to Mapanje\u2019s arrest in 1987.  \u00a0 Mapanje was detained in Malawi\u2019s notorious Mikuyu Prison without charge from September 1987 until May 1991.\u00a0 During these four years, Mapanje wrote The Chattering Wagtails of Mikuyu Prison (1993) and most of Skipping without Ropes (1998), his second and third collections. While in prison, Mapanje was awarded the Rotterdam Poetry International Award in 1988.  \u00a0 In an interview with Richard Lea for The Guardian in 2007, Mapanje stated, \u201cI started writing when I discovered that the politicians in my country were telling a lot of lies. So I thought, even if nobody reads me, I'm going to tell a bit of truth.\u201d Describing the pact his fellow prisoners made, Mapanje explained, \u201cThe decision was this: survive, and you will embarrass the dictator with your life. Die and give up, then he has triumphed. Victory for you is first, survival. Second, if you have the opportunity, tell your story.\u201d \u00a0 Since his release, Mapanje has written and edited several books of poetry, including Gathering Seaweed: African Prison Writing (2002). He has also edited Kalulu, an oral literature journal. He currently lives in York, England, where he teaches creative writing and literatures of incarceration at Newcastle University.\u00a0 \u00a0\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Africa"]}}
