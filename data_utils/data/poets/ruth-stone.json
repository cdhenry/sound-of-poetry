She lived in a rural farmhouse in Vermont for much of her life and received widespread recognition relatively late with the publication of Ordinary Words (1999). The book won the National Book Critics Circle Award and was soon followed by other award-winning collections, including In the Next Galaxy (2002), winner of the National Book Award; In the Dark (2004); and What Love Comes To: New & Selected Poems (2008), a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Stone\u2019s compact lyrics are known for their accuracy, strangeness, and ability to speak to domestic concerns and metaphysical problems at once. Witty and wry, her poems strike \u201ca tragic/comic register few other American poets have struck,\u201d noted Chard deNiord in the Guardian. He described Stone\u2019s work as \u201coften reminiscent of Emily Dickinson\u2019s double-edged verse, only in a more conversational style.\u201d The poet Sandra Gilbert, an early champion of Stone\u2019s, noted that the \u201cspecial boldness\u201d of Stone\u2019s poetry is \u201cat least in part a product of the pain and loss she\u2019s had to confront, the perilous life she\u2019s lived at the edge of comforts most other people of letters take for granted in our society \u2026 her extraordinary words are among those that will flow through the valley of our saying from here to there, from now to then, into the farthest reaches of the twenty-first century and beyond.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nStone\u2019s first book of verse, In an Iridescent Time, was published in 1959. Shortly after, Stone\u2019s second husband, the promising poet and writer Walter Stone, committed suicide, leaving Stone a widow with three young children. The shock and grief of her husband\u2019s suicide marked her poetry for the rest of her life. She settled in Vermont but for many years moved from one university to another in short-term teaching positions. Stone did not publish her second book, Topography, until 1971 and remained a fairly obscure voice until the series of awards and accolades at the beginning of the millennium drew national attention. In 1990, she became a professor of English at SUNY Binghamton.\r\n\u00a0\r\nStone\u2019s other honors and awards include two Guggenheim Fellowships, the Bess Hokin Prize, the Wallace Stevens Award, the Shelley Memorial Award, and the Walter Cerf Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Arts. Stone\u2019s acceptance speech for the National Book Awards illustrates both her devotion to poetry and her humility:\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing poetry or whatever it is since I was five or six years old, and I couldn\u2019t stop, I never could stop. I don\u2019t know why I did it.\u2026 It was like a stream that went along beside me, you know, my life went along here, and I got married and had three kids and did all the things you have to do, and all along the time this stream was going along. And I really didn\u2019t know what it was saying. It just talked to me, and I wrote it down. So I can\u2019t even take much credit for it.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\nThe author of 13 books of poetry, Ruth Stone died in late 2011.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
