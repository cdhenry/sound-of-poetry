Other translation projects include, with Wesley Smith, Andromache (2001) by Euripides and, with Brunella Antomarini, Scipione: Poems and Prose (2001).\nStewart is also the author of several books that critically examine form, culture, aesthetics, representation, and poetry, including Crimes of Writing (1991), On Longing (1993), Poetry and the Fate of the Senses (2002), which received both the Christian Gauss and Truman Capote awards for literary criticism in 2002, The Open Studio (2005), The Poet\u2019s Freedom: A Notebook on Making\u00a0(2011), and The Ruins Lesson: Meaning and Material in Western Culture (2020). She has also collaborated with artists and composers, including Ann Hamilton and the composer James Primosch.\nIn an interview at the University of Pennsylvania, Susan Stewart said that her primary goal as a poet is \u201cto get people to read more slowly, and to reread, and to read a whole book and go back to the beginning of the book and see connections.\u201d Her writing can be startlingly clear, while at the same time\u2014in the words of the MacArthur Foundation, on the occasion of presenting her with a \u201cGenius Award\u201d\u2014it makes \u201cstrange and disorienting that which we usually take to be familiar and of common sense.\u201d\nIn addition to the MacArthur fellowship, Stewart has received fellowships from the Pew Charitable Trusts, the Guggenheim Foundation, the American Academy in Berlin, as well as two grants from the NEA. She is the recipient of a Lila Wallace Individual Writer\u2019s Award and an Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. She served as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets from 2005 to 2011. Stewart is currently the Avalon Foundation University Professor in the Humanities and professor of English at Princeton University, where she is editor of the Princeton Series of Contemporary Poets. In 2020 she will deliver the Clarendon Lectures at Oxford University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
