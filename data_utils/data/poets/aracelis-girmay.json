Her poems trace the connections of transformation and loss across cities and bodies.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn her 2011 online chat interview with the Rumpus Poetry Book Club, Girmay discussed innovative and hybrid poetric forms, stating, \u201cI wonder what new explorations of form might have to do with documenting the new and old ways of thinking about power. Of how we\u2019ve been taught to think by our families, institutions, television, computer culture, etc. [\u2026.] Perhaps the so-called hybrid poems are about dislocating or splintering the central lens.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nHer poetry collections include Teeth (2007),\u00a0Kingdom Animalia (2011), and The Black Maria (2016), named a \u201cTop Poetry Pick\u201d by Publisher's Weekly, O Magazine, and Library Journal. She is also the author of the collage-based picture book changing, changing (2005).\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn 2011 Girmay was awarded a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts and in 2015 she received a Whiting Award for Poetry. A Cave Canem Fellow and an Acentos board member, she led youth and community writing workshops. She currently teaches at Hampshire College. She lives in New York City.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
