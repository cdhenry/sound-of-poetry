Frequently writing poems and radio plays, Huchel quickly established himself as a major voice in German poetry before he was drafted for service in World War II, when he was taken prisoner by the Russian army. Following his release, he worked as the editor of the influential German literary magazine Sinn und Form (Sense and Form) and received support from figures such as Bertolt Brecht and Johannes R. Becher when Huchel published voices from the Western world rather than German Marxist work. As a result, in 1962, Huchel was removed from his editorial post. In the 1960s, he was not allowed to leave Germany, but in 1971, he moved to Rome before settling eventually in Staufen im Breisgau, Germany, where he died in 1981.\n\u00a0Huchel\u2019s poetry has been characterized as post-Romantic nature poetry. Michael Hamburger writes that Huchel\u2019s early verse contained an \u201cearthiness and a wealth of observed, lived particulars\u201d as well as \u201cmythical and occult overtones.\u201d\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Germany"]}}
