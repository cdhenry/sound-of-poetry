He holds a BA from Williams College, MA degrees in English Literature from both the University of Sussex and Cornell University, and a PhD in English Literature, also from Cornell University.\nThe NEA Writers\u2019 Corner describes his first book, The Book of Faces (2005), as a \u201cmeditation on the life, films, and faces of Audrey Hepburn.\u201d In his NEA author\u2019s statement, Campana writes,\u00a0 \u201c[The work] was a study in icons. If the icon in question happened to be Audrey Hepburn, it was nonetheless a work built in and around experiences of devotion: how we become shaped by that which we love.\u201d In The Book of Faces, Campana explores idolatry through a variety of forms, including canzones, dramatic monologues, lists, and sonnets. Alice Fulton observes, \u201cHis poems\u2014lovely, witty, sincere or cynical things\u2014are haunted both by Hepburn (and her leading men) and by a fascinating array of literary specters: Catullus, Petrarch, Chaucer, Spenser, Foucault, Barthes.\u201d Jorie Graham also notes that the \u201cfaces\u201d of Campana\u2019s \u201cbeautifully inventive first collection\u201d are \u201cthose that stare most urgently at us while we grow blind: hunger (spiritual and literal), war, peace, fame, hope, fashion, heartlessness, greed.\u201d\nCampana\u2019s second poetry collection, Natural Selections (2012), received the Iowa Poetry Prize.\u00a0His poems have appeared publications such as Crab Orchard Review, Hotel Amerika, New England Review, Poetry, Prairie Schooner, and TriQuarterly.\nA scholar who has published essays on Edmund Spenser, William Shakespeare, early modern poetics, and the history of sexuality, Campana is a regular contributor to the Kenyon Review\u2019s blog. He is the author of The Pain of Reformation: Spenser, Vulnerability, and the Ethics of Masculinity (2012).\nA NEA Creative Writing Fellowship recipient, Campana received Prairie Schooner\u2019s Glenna Luschei Award and the Isabelle McCaffrey Essay Prize from the International Spenser Society. He has taught at Cornell University, Kenyon College, and Rice University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
