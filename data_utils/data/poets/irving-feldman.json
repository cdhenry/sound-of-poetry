As a teenager, he watched from across the Atlantic as the atrocities of World War II unfolded in Europe, and the Holocaust and its attendant questions haunt much of his work, which poet-critic John Hollander calls \u201camazing in its moral intensity.\u201d\n\r\nFeldman\u2019s many collections of poetry include\u00a0Teach Me, Dear Sister\u00a0(1983),\u00a0All of Us Here (1986),\u00a0Beautiful False Things\u00a0(2000), and Collected Poems 1954-2000. His poetry shows no fear of form or tone\u2014he has written everything from essays to jokes to prose poems to aphorisms to psalms\u2014in his pursuit to illuminate all facets of the human condition. As John Gross wrote in a New York Times review of his book All of Us Here (1986), his \u201cidiom [can] extend from the elegiac to the racily colloquial\u201d in a single poem.\n\r\nThe recipient of many awards, including fellowships from the Academy of American Poets, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Ingram Merrill Foundation, and the MacArthur Foundation, Feldman has also been a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and was twice a finalist for the National Book Award.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
