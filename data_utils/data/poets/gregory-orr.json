His poetry has been widely anthologized and translated into at least 10 languages. Observes critic Hank Lazer, \u201cFrom Burning the Empty Nests (1973) to the present, Orr gradually developed the ability to fuse his incredible skill at visual precision\u2014the signature of his image-based work in his very first book\u2014with an insistent musical quality, joining visual precision with a beauty of sound.\u201d\n\r\nWhen Orr was 12, he accidentally killed his brother in a hunting accident, an event his family was never able to talk about. His mother died soon thereafter, and Orr found in poetry the transformative power of language. His near-death experience as a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) during the civil rights movement, in which he was jailed and severely beaten, contributes to the urgency with which his poems seek transformation. In an NPR story on his craft, Orr states, \u201cI believe in poetry as a way of surviving the emotional chaos, spiritual confusions, and traumatic events that come with being alive.\u201d\n\r\nOrr has received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities. He has also been a Fulbright Scholar and a Rockefeller Fellow at the Institute for the Study of Culture and Violence, and he received the Award in Literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.
