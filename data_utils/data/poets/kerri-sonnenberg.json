She is the author of the chapbook Political Art Criticism (2004) and the book-length collection of poems The Mudra (2004). In The Mudra, Paul Hoover found Sonnenberg using \u201c[b]oth the fragment, with its suggestion of absence, and the oblique narrative, with its ghostly suggestion of a \u2018whole,\u2019 [as a] means of expressing [\u2026] worlds we thought we knew.\u201d  Sonnenberg\u2019s poetry has appeared in the anthologies The City Visible: Chicago Poetry for the New Century (2007) and The &NOW Awards: The Best Innovative Writing (2009). She edits the journal Conundrum and has collaborated with her husband, the composer Jeffrey Weeter.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
