She also studied at Brooklyn College and in the acting program at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City. She is the author of the novels Self Care (2020)\u00a0and\u00a0The Fallback Plan (2012), the memoir Land of Enchantment (2016), and the poetry collection Dispatch from the Future (2012).\u00a0Her nonfiction writing has appeared in the New York Times, the Washington Post, the New Yorker, Allure, The Cut, Salon, Slate, and elsewhere.\nStein\u2019s poems submerge stark emotional reflection within landscapes influenced by reality television, museum exhibits, and folk tales. In a 2009 interview with poet and blogger Gregory Lawless for his blog I Thought I Was New Here: Poems and Whatnot, Stein stated, \u201cI think it would be fair to classify my poems as confessional, genuinely; I\u2019m aiming for emotional honesty throughout, even in narratives that veer off into the absurd.\u201d Publishers Weekly described Stein\u2019s debut collection as \u201ca mix both giddy and anguished that incorporates elements from fairy tale, pop-culture, ancient myth, and choose-your-own-adventure books. These poems swing between the dull throb of disappointment and what she calls \u2018hope\u2019s stubborn blindness.\u2019\u201d\nStein\u2019s honors include an Amy Award from Poets & Writers and a Pushcart Prize nomination. From 2014 to 2017, Leigh served as executive director of Out of the Binders/BinderCon, a feminist literary nonprofit organization. She has worked on the New Yorker staff and taught drama to children. She lives in Brooklyn.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
