She has published six collections of poetry, including Days of Wonder: New and Selected Poems (2002),\u00a0The Broken String (2007), and Without a Claim (2013). Her collection of essays,\u00a0First Loves and Other Adventures (2010),\u00a0reflects on her life as a writer and reader.\nTypically written in a lucid free verse that occasionally reaches vatic heights, Schulman\u2019s poems often take on subjects of art, history, and faith. Schulman\u2019s history is usually that of her beloved New York City, where she has lived and worked as a dedicated poetry advocate all her life. Earthly moments and details of city life constantly suggest larger spiritual questions. Poet\u00a0Ron Slate\u00a0has described Schulman as \u201cnot only a poet of praise, but one who addresses the grounding questions of this mode. How and why do we find beauty in adversity?\u201d\nSchulman names Hopkins, Donne, Shakespeare, Dante, Whitman, and Marianne Moore\u00a0as her influences. When Schulman was a teenager she was introduced to Moore, who had a profound effect on her poetics. Schulman wrote on the poet in a critical study,\u00a0Marianne Moore:\u00a0The Poetry of Engagement\u00a0(1986), and edited\u00a0The Poems of Marianne Moore\u00a0(2004).\u00a0Schulman has received numerous awards for her work, including the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Award, the Aiken Taylor Award for poetry, and Pushcart prizes. She has received fellowships from the New York Foundation of the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation. Her work has been published the Nation, the New Yorker, and numerous other magazines and journals, and appeared in The Best of the Best American Poetry 1988\u20131998.\nSchulman was married to the scientist Jerome L.
