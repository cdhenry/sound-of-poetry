She studied at New Mexico State University. Her poetry collections include Rival Gardens (2016), On Speaking Terms (2010), Hartley Field (2002), and Bonfire (1997), winner of the New Voices Award from New Rivers Press.\nWanek\u2019s image-driven poems often engage nature and natural order. Praising Hartley Field, poet David Orr observed, \u201cWanek is from Wisconsin, but her sensibility often seems Eastern European or Scandinavian. Like Szymborska, Wanek likes to end poems with poised yet cutting observations or intimations of dread that can turn ordinary activities into existential dilemmas.\u201d\nWanek is also the author of a collection of stories, Summer Cars (2014).\nHer honors include the Willow Poetry Prize, the Jane Kenyon Poetry Prize, and a Witter Bynner Fellowship at the Library of Congress. She coedited, with Joyce Sutphen and Thom Tammaro, the anthology To Sing Along the Way: Minnesota Women Poets from Pre-Territorial Days to the Present (2006).\nShe lives with her family in Duluth, Minnesota, where she has worked at the public library and as a restorer of old homes.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
