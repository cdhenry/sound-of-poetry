Peter Johnson, reviewing Chickenhead, commented that the sketches in the collection were \u201cboth comic and terrifying, dreamlike yet clearly metaphors for our so-called real world. In Chickenhead, Garcia has fun with us, which means, of course, that he is deadly serious.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nGarcia is also the author of My Aunt Otilia\u2019s Spirits = Los esp\u00edritus de mi t\u00eda Otilia (1987), a bilingual children\u2019s book, and has conducted poetry and art workshops while serving as Poet-in-Residence at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Los Angeles from 1991-2002.
