Klein\u2019s poetry collections include\u00a0Consolation and Mirth (2015), Moving Day\u00a0(2011) and\u00a0Union!\u00a0(2009). Her poems have also appeared in the magazines Fence, Jubilat, and Epiphany, among many others.\nWith both vulnerability and humor, Klein\u2019s lyrical poems measure the strata of daily social and literary engagement. \u201cKlein\u2019s work consistently explores the conflict between authenticity and literary convention,\u201d observes\u00a0Boston Review\u2019s Kristina Marie Darling in a review of\u00a0Union!, noting that the poet \u201ccreates a unique narrative space in which literary history coexists with modern life, ultimately contemporizing the loftiness of the Elizabethans, the melancholy of the Romantics, and Modernism\u2019s fascination with the poetic image.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nKlein was awarded a Digital Filmmaker Residency from the National Endowment for the Arts, and her films have been screened at the Stuttgart Film Winter festival, Arlene\u2019s Picture Show, and the Philadelphia Film Festival. The author of the plays The Storm, The D Men, The Orchids, Drummer 41, and \u201cIn A Word, Faust,\u201d she is a founding member of the Connecticut River Valley Poets Theater (CRVPT).\nShe lives with her partner Greg Purcell in Chicago, Illinois and works in theater.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
