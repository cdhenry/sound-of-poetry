His mother\u2019s death while he was still a teenager had a profound influence on him. He studied Classics and philosophy at McGill University, and he earned his PhD in comparative literature from the University of Chicago. The editor of Poetry from 1968-78, Hine was also a highly regarded translator of Classical writers such as Homer, Hesiod, and Ovid, among others; Hine\u2019s translation of Works of Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns (2005) won the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award from the Academy of American Poets. His numerous other honors and awards included fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation, as well as a medal from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He also received three Canada Council Grants, and his &: A Serial Poem (2010) was short-listed for the Governor General\u2019s Award for Poetry. The award's judges described the book as \u201ca reflection on civilization as a whole,\u201d declaring it \u201cthe summing up of a life in particular weighed against eternity.\u201d\n\r\nAll of Hine\u2019s poetry is known for its interest in philosophy, history, art, and literature, as well as its carefully formulated moments of autobiography. In early books such as The Carnal and the Crane (1957) and The Devil\u2019s Picture Book (1960), Hine\u2019s classical education took center stage and his reputation as a \u201cpoet\u2019s poet\u201d was confirmed. Writing in complicated formal structures\u2014including anapestic trimeter, rime riche, and Sapphics, as well as sestinas, villanelles, and alexandrines\u2014Hine\u2019s verse was frequently described as \u201cflawless\u201d\u2014almost to a fault. \u201cIn Daryl Hine,\" wrote critic Louis Dudek, \"we have an amazingly capable poet for whom poetry is not a mimetic art, whose eye is not in a fine frenzy rolling, who does not overflow with powerful emotion\u2026 but a poet from whom poetry is a series of extremely recherche, abstract, contrived word forms, containing oblique and ambiguous philosophical essays and meditations.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nThough he suffered some criticism for seeming to privilege form over content, many readers praised Hine\u2019s ability to marry the two in grand fashion. Eric Ormsby commented that, \u201cHine is a poet in whom an almost irresistible exuberance of language brims to the utmost; a fierce jollity, a luxuriance in the elemental stuff of words, propels his verse. At certain moments, in reading him, one has the startled sense that language has arrived at a kind of impasse which only a quick scintillation of wit\u2014in the form of a sly rhyme, a subtle pun or an extravagant rhetorical flourish\u2014can grace, if not elude. As a result, Hine\u2019s poems, unlike the brittle pirouettes of the formalist, seem to take shape, in all their glistening eloquence, hot from some secret forge.\u201d In books such as In and Out (1989), a long narrative poem that explores Hine\u2019s emerging homosexuality and brief interest in the Catholic church, and Postscripts (1991), a collection of lyrics, Hine explored personal content while displaying his characteristically dazzling form. In Contemporary Poetry Review, Bill Coyle called Hine \u201csimply one of the best poets of Eros and of the wonder, touched with fear that it can provoke.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe publication of Recollected Poems: 1951-2004 (2009) showed the very real achievements of Hine. Arranged according to subject rather than chronology the work offered readers a chance to observe the remarkable consistency of Hine\u2019s career. According to Ormsby, \u201cit would be hard to guess, without the dates provided, which [poems] are early and which late. To judge from the work \u2018recollected\u2019 here, Hine seems to have sprung fully formed from Apollo\u2019s head. There are few hesitations and almost no false starts. Even more impressive, his sheer technical virtuosity aside, Hine\u2019s distinctive voice is recognizable from the first.\u201d &: A Serial Poem (2010) was also written under strict formal constraints\u2014303 stanzas of ten lines each, with an intricate rhyme scheme and accentual meter. In The Critical Flame, Alexander Lewis describe the book as an almost-diary: \u201cToo oblique and plotless to be called autobiographical, but with too many recognizable allusions to the life and works of Daryl Hine to seem anything other than confessional, & exists somewhere between both.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nA forerunner in late 20th century American poetry, Daryl Hine\u2019s work both explored conventional styles and charted new territory. Though abstract, lofty, formal, and glittering, Hine\u2019s work is also tender, honest, and rigorous. Arguing for Hine\u2019s importance to contemporary poetry, Coyle alleged: \u201chonestly, Hine is able to work miracles. Recollected Poems concludes with imitations of\u00a0parts of Ovid\u2019s Tristia that Hine has cast entirely\u2014and I would have thought foolhardily\u2014in rime riche couplets, even, at one point, rhyming Narcissi with sissy. Damned if he doesn\u2019t make this work, though.\u201d\n\r\nHine lived in Illinois with his partner of more than 30 years, Samuel Todes, a philosophy professor at Northwestern University. After Todes\u2019s death in 1994, Hine became increasingly reclusive. Hine died of a blood disorder in 2012, at the age of 76.\r\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Canada"]}}
