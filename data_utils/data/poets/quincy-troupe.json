After studying for two semesters at Grambling College on a scholarship, he left to join the army. When his service ended, he moved to Los Angeles, California and began teaching writing workshops at the Watts Writers Workshop. He later held positions at the University of California, San Diego; Ohio University; the College of Staten Island; and California State University. He also taught in the Columbia University Graduate Writing Program, as well as at various institutions abroad. His many poetry collections include Seduction: New Poems, 2013-2018;\u00a0Ghost Voices: A Poem in Prayer (2018);\u00a0Erran\u00e7ities\u00a0(2011);\u00a0The Architecture of Language\u00a0(2007), which won the Paterson Award for Sustained Achievement;\u00a0Choruses\u00a0(1999);\u00a0and the American Book Award-winning\u00a0Snake-back Solos: Selected Poems, 1969\u20131977\u00a0(1979). A noted performer of his work, Troupe has twice won the prestigious Heavyweight Champion of Poetry, a distinction given by the World Poetry Bout of Taos. He has also founded and edited magazines such as\u00a0Confrontation: A Journal of Third World Literature,\u00a0American Rag,\u00a0and\u00a0Code,\u00a0where he was editorial director.\nTroupe\u2019s energetic, highly syncopated poetry melds contemporary music rhythms\u2014such as rap, jazz, and bebop\u2014to a \u201cfurious rush of images, sometimes jarring, arising from personal experience,\u201d according to critic Tony Perry in the\u00a0Los Angeles Times.\u00a0Celebratory, but also cautionary, Troupe\u2019s subjects range from jazz and sports to racism and urban decay. Critics frequently group him with Black Arts Movement writers such as Amiri Baraka,\u00a0Nikki Giovanni, and\u00a0Haki Madhubuti.\nIn addition to books of poetry, Troupe has written, co-written, and edited numerous nonfiction works and anthologies. With Rainer Schulte, he edited\u00a0Giant Talk: An Anthology of Third World Writings\u00a0(1975), an anthology of poems, folk tales, short stories, and novel excerpts by Black Americans, Native Americans, Hispanic Americans, Black Africans, and Central and South Americans. Jack Slater declared the anthology \u201ccomprehensive\u201d in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review.\u00a0Troupe also co-wrote\u00a0The Inside Story of TV\u2019s \u201cRoots\u201d\u00a0(1978)\u00a0with David L. Wolper, a book that chronicles the production of the highly successful television miniseries about slavery in America,\u00a0Roots,\u00a0which is based on Alex Haley\u2019s book of the same title. The Inside Story of TV\u2019s \u201cRoots\u201d has sold over one million copies. Troupe edited\u00a0James Baldwin: The Legacy\u00a0(1987), a collection of tributes and remembrances from writers like\u00a0Maya Angelou,\u00a0Amiri Baraka, Toni Morrison, Chinua Achebe, and others.\nTroupe\u2019s most popular nonfiction works explore the life and work of renowned jazz musician Miles Davis.\u00a0His collaboration with Davis on the book\u00a0Miles: The Autobiography\u00a0(1989),\u00a0won the American Book Award. Later, Troupe wrote his own account of their friendship in\u00a0Miles and Me\u00a0(2000). Troupe has been inspired by and fascinated with Davis since he first heard his music as teenager in St. Louis. In an interview with Douglas Turner, Troupe noted, \u201cIf I had not heard Miles\u2019s music in that fish joint, I don\u2019t think that I would be sitting here looking at this beautiful view I\u2019m looking at now. Miles set me on a path that is remarkable in a lot of ways. He\u2019s on that set me on the path to writing and using my imagination, and being creative \u2026 That\u2019s what fate is. Because I heard that music, he propelled me into this thing that I do now.\u201d With Chris Gardner, Troupe also co-wrote\u00a0The Pursuit of Happyness\u00a0(2006), Gardner\u2019s rags-to-riches autobiography. The book spent over 40 weeks on the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0bestseller list and was turned into a blockbuster Hollywood film starring Will Smith.\n\r\nIn his interview with Turner, Troupe reflected on the various identities he has both assumed and been asked to assume: \u201cI see myself as an artist and a poet. I\u2019m basically influenced by and coming out of the African American, but American, tradition. I\u2019m African American because I was born African American and proud of it. I don\u2019t run away from that. But as an artist, I see myself as a poet first, and then I see myself as a prose writer. I agree with Miles. He looked at himself as a musician and an artist \u2026 I come out of St. Louis, the black culture there and the music there. I grew up in the church. I was a basketball player. I\u2019m a poet. That\u2019s the way I approach myself.\u201d\nTroupe lives in New York and edits the journal\u00a0Black Renaissance Noire,\u00a0the publication of the Department of Africana Studies at New York University.\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Black Arts Movement"]}}
