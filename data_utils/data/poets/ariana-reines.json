Her books of poetry include The Cow (2006), Coeur de Lion (2007), Mercury (2011), Thursday (2012), Beyond Relief (2013), The Origin of the World (2014), Ramayana (2015), Tiffany's Poems (2015), and A Sand Book (2019). Her poems have been anthologized in Corrected Slogans (2013), Miscellaneous Uncatalogued Materials (2011), Against Expression (2011), and Gurlesque (2010). Known for her interest in bodily experience, the occult, new media, and the possibilities of the long or book-length form, Reines has been described as \u201cone of the crucial voices of her generation\u201d by Michael Silverblatt on NPR\u2019s Bookworm. At once personal, Romantic, slippery, and extreme, Reines\u2019s poetry investigates and overturns lyric conventions. Of her own work, she admitted in an interview with HTML Giant: \u201cMy best writing seems to have to be forced from me by some other force but that force has to be one whose power I agree to serve.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nReines\u2019s first play Telephone (2009) was performed at the Cherry Lane Theater and received two Obie Awards. A re-imagining of its second act was featured as part of the Guggenheim\u2019s Works+Process series in 2009, and the script was published in Play: A Journal of Plays in 2010. Reines\u2019s translations include a version of Baudelaire\u2019s My Heart Laid Bare (2009); Jean-Luc Hennig\u2019s The Little Black Book of Gris\u00e9lidis R\u00e9al: Days and Nights of an Anarchist Whore(2009); and Tiqqun\u2019s Preliminary Materials Toward a Theory of the Young-Girl (2012).\r\n\u00a0\r\nReines was awarded the Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award in 2020. She has taught at Columbia University and the European Graduate School, where she studied literature, performance, and philosophy. In 2009 she was the Roberta C. Holloway Lecturer in Poetry at the University of California-Berkeley, the youngest poet to ever hold that position. She has served as a translator on United Nations missions to Haiti, as part of the on-going relief efforts there.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
