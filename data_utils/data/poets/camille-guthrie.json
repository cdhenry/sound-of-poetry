She is the author of the poetry collections\u00a0The Master Thief\u00a0(2000),\u00a0In Captivity\u00a0(2006), and\u00a0Articulated Lair: Poems for Louise Bourgeois (2013). Her experimental long poems and inter-textual poetic sequences often engage with ongoing literary conversations and the history of\u00a0ekphrasis. In an interview with\u00a0Chicago Review, Guthrie stated, \u201cWriting about another text or object and in poetic form often serves as a self-inflicted restraint in my work; forms are surely a kind of capture, scrupulous and absorbing rituals. Then it's satisfying to wreck them somehow, to make them imperfect.\u201d She is the Director of Undergraduate Writing Initiatives at Bennington College.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
