A trilingual author, equally competent in Russian, English, and French, Nabokov wrote prodigiously during the course of his 78 years, producing a body of work that, when collected, was estimated to fill 40 volumes. Though he began as a poet, Nabokov quickly branched into writing in numerous genres, including fiction, drama, autobiography, translations, essays, literary criticism, and even, on occasion, scientific studies of butterflies and collections of chess problems. His writing remains distinctive, and several critics often cite Lolita, Nabokov\u2019s best-known work, as a prime example of truly original invention. \u201cHe is a major force in the contemporary novel,\u201d critic Anthony Burgess asserted in The Novel Now: A Guide to Contemporary Fiction. In a New Republic article, John Updike also acknowledged Nabokov\u2019s tremendous impact on 20th-century literature, citing him as one of the few writers \u201cwhose books, considered as a whole, give the happy impression of an oeuvre, of a continuous task carried forward variously, of a solid personality, of a plenitude of gifts exploited knowingly. His works are an edifice whose every corner rewards inspection. Each \u2026 yields delight and presents to the aesthetic sense the peculiar hardness of a finished, fully meant thing. His sentences are beautiful out of context and doubly beautiful in it. He writes prose the only way it should be written\u2014that is ecstatically. In the intensity of its intelligence and reflective joy, his fiction is unique \u2026 and scarcely precedented in American literature.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nDespite an awareness of his technical brilliance and verbal facility, readers have sometimes been bewildered by the complexity of Nabokov\u2019s writing. \u201cVirtually all of the foremost literary critics in the United States and England have written about Nabokov, with enthusiasm often bordering on awe,\u201d noted Andrew Field in Nabokov: His Life in Art. \u201cBut their eloquence, where one wants and would expect explication, betrays the fact that they are at least as ill at ease with Nabokov as they are fascinated by him.\u201d Critic Alfred Kazin, for instance, after reading Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle, wrote in the New York Times: \u201cFor some weeks now I have been floundering and traveling in the mind of that American genius Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov.\u201d In that novel, as in almost all his works, Nabokov intentionally laced the narrative with obscure literary allusions and trilingual puns which pivot on an understanding of Russian\u2014and to a lesser degree French\u2014language and culture. Though helpful, even a broad knowledge of European literature would not make Nabokov\u2019s creations entirely clear for, as an artist, he enjoyed playing tricks on his readers.\r\n\u00a0\r\nA consummate gamesman, Nabokov reveled in what Field called \u201cartistic duplicity\u201d and conceived of writing as an elaborate interplay between author and reader. In the literature courses he taught at Cornell, reprinted in Lectures on Literature, Nabokov instructed his students \u201cto read books for the sake of their form, their visions, their art\u201d and cautioned them \u201cto share not the emotions of the people in the book but the emotions of its author\u2014the joys and difficulties of creation.\u201d Projected into almost all his narratives\u2014including those, like Lolita, which seem to revolve around a traditional plot\u2014are \u201cthinly disguised bits of literary criticism and \u2026 a variety of literary games involving allusion to and parody and citation of other men\u2019s writings,\u201d noted New York Times Book Review contributor Simon Karlinsky. Alfred Appel, also writing in the New York Times Book Review, described Nabokov as \u201cthe most allusive and linguistically playful writer in English since [James] Joyce.\u201d\nIn addition to the difficulties presented by Nabokov\u2019s artistic deceptions, the circumstances of his checkered past further cloud his writing. Long after Nabokov had adopted English as his chosen language, his earlier writings remained untranslated and thus available only in the original Russian. These early poems, reviews, essays, and fictions were published in Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 newspapers, first in Berlin, Germany and, later, in Paris when that city became the center of \u00e9migr\u00e9 culture. The difficulties for American readers were further compounded, for without easy access to either source, they had no real context in which to place his work. \u201cNone of my American friends have read my Russian books and thus every appraisal on the strength of my English ones is bound to be out of focus,\u201d Nabokov wrote in a passage reprinted by Field. Field himself postulated that \u201cif the substantial body of Nabokov\u2019s Russian writing and the best critical articles about him had been translated before 1950, it is extremely unlikely that Lolita or Pale Fire would have been nearly as misunderstood as they were.\u201d In later years, Nabokov partially remedied the problem by working in close cooperation with his son Dmitri to translate his books.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBefore the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 that precipitated his family\u2019s flight, Nabokov led a charmed life in one of Russia\u2019s noble families. His father was a distinguished lawyer and one of the country\u2019s few political liberals, opposed to both Tsarist absolutism and the revolutionary Bolsheviks. It was the elder statesman\u2019s custom to take a daily bath in a portable rubber tub, and this habit was adopted by his favorite son, who considered the warm water a catalyst of creative inspiration. From his father, Vladimir also seems to have inherited his belief in patrician democracy\u2014\u201cMy father was an old-fashioned liberal, and I do not mind being labeled an old-fashioned liberal, too,\u201d he said in a Paris Review interview\u2014an interest in the criminal mind, a capacity for sustained work, and a passionate love of butterflies. Because his father wrote under the name Vladimir Nabokov, young Vladimir adopted a pseudonym, V. Sirin. His mother, \u201cequally aristocratic\u201d according to Samuel Schuman in Vladimir Nabokov: A Reference Guide, \u201cwas most distinguished in her son\u2019s memory by a finely developed and artistic sensitivity, sharing many of the novelist\u2019s acute reactions to sense impressions, especially reactions to color and sound.\u201d Nabokov recorded his impressions in Speak Memory: Memoir, considered by many to be one of the finest autobiographies in the English language.\r\n\u00a0\r\nVladimir was the eldest and, by all accounts, the most precocious of the five Nabokov children. He was adored by his parents, and they considered his education a matter of utmost concern. During his early childhood, which was divided between St. Petersburg and Vyra, the family\u2019s country estate, he was privately tutored by a governess who taught him to speak English, the first language he learned. When he was 12 Nabokov enrolled in the liberal Tenishev Academy in St. Petersburg, and there, during his six-year stay, he privately printed two books of poetry. In 1916, the same year his first chapbook, Poems, appeared, Nabokov inherited an estate worth several million dollars from his \u201cUncle Ruka.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nUnfortunately, this prosperity would be short-lived. Just three years later the entire Nabokov family was forced to abandon their home and take refuge in the southern portion of Russia known as the Crimea. As they waited for the restoration of political order and the opportunity to return, unrest spread and the family again decamped, hurriedly boarding a boat bound for England. \u201cThe flight into exile resulted in the loss of most of the Nabokov fortune and, much more importantly for Vladimir, the loss of a homeland, a culture, and a language,\u201d Schuman observed. \u201cThat set of losses was perhaps the single most crucial event in the artist\u2019s lifetime\u2014the role of the exile and the vitality of memory remained dominant motifs in Nabokov\u2019s work for the next half-century.\u201d Field reported in Vladimir Nabokov: His Life in Part that one of the author\u2019s 1920 poems \u201crefers to that trip into exile of the previous year as \u2018sailing to nowhere.\u2019\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nNabokov spent the years from 1919 to 1922 studying Romance and Slavic languages at Cambridge and writing Russian poetry. He was an indifferent scholar until his father was assassinated at a political rally in Berlin in March, 1922. After that traumatic event, Nabokov \u201creturned for his last term with the determination to do well and took his degree with honors,\u201d according to Donald E. Morton in his book, Vladimir Nabokov. After graduation, Nabokov moved to Berlin, the heart of the \u00e9migr\u00e9 community, and began contributing poems and prose to Rul (\u201cRudder\u201d), a Russian-language daily his father had helped to found. For many years Nabokov entertained hopes of returning to Russia and continued to write primarily in Russian, a choice \u201cmade easier by the fact that I lived in a closed \u00e9migr\u00e9 circle of Russian friends and read exclusively Russian newspapers, magazines and books,\u201d Nabokov recalled in Strong Opinions. In 1925 he married Vera Evseevna Slonim, who became his lifelong companion and literary assistant, and in 1926 his first novel, Mashen\u2019ka (later translated as Mary), appeared.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhile the original Russian version of Mary received little attention, after Nabokov\u2019s reputation burgeoned and the work was translated into English, it received closer scrutiny. \u201cIn it,\u201d noted a Virginia Quarterly Review contributor, \u201cwe find some pleasing confirmations of what we have assumed to be Nabokov\u2019s themes.\u201d Mary details what life was like for the residents of a Berlin boardinghouse in the early 1920s, and is a nostalgic tale of a young \u00e9migr\u00e9\u2019s longing for the love he left behind in Russia. As the story opens, the protagonist, Ganin, meets a fellow boarder in a stalled elevator and learns that the man is anticipating the arrival of his Russian wife in six days. Halfway through the novel, Ganin realizes that his friend\u2019s wife is none other than his beloved Mary. He plots to interrupt the marital liaison and meet her in her husband\u2019s stead. At the last moment, however, he realizes that she will not be the same girl he remembers, and he departs, leaving her waiting alone at the station.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAccording to New York Times reviewer John Leonard, \u201cthe heroine would appear to be as much Mother Russia as the girl Mary; they are coextensive.\u201d Morton expressed a similar view, noting that \u201cthe absent girl is a symbol of the exiles\u2019 longing for their lost homeland.\u201d Guy Davenport maintained in National Review that Mary \u201cis about a man who has two minds, one containing an imaginary world, the other well-focused on reality. The characters, except for the lovely (and unseen) Mary, are all Nabokovian marginal people inhabiting interims and delusions. Practically all of the later themes are here.\u201d Writing in the New York Times Book Review, Mark Slonim identified two of those themes as \u201cthe powers of memory and imagination,\u201d and went on to suggest that, for Nabokov, these attitudes are \u201cthe lifegiving source of all creative acts and \u2026 the very foundations of art. Of course, Nabokov has traveled a long road and changed greatly since his twenties when he wrote Mary, but throughout his work he has never failed to assert the basic truth that forms the core of his first novel.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn addition to their contributions to his thematic development, the early fictions also shaped Nabokov\u2019s literary technique. \u201cIt was in his Russian novels \u2026 that he developed his art of incorporating literary allusion and reference as an inherent device of fictional narration,\u201d explained Simon Karlinsky in the New York Times Book Review. Nabokov\u2019s second novel, Korol\u2019, dama, valet (translated as King, Queen, Knave), marks the first appearance of this device. \u201cIt is \u2026 the first of his novels to have a plot and character serve as vehicles for the real subject, which is form, style and the strategies of total creation,\u201d noted Eliot Fremont-Smith in the New York Times. In this story, one of several Nabokovian variations on the eternal love triangle, a vain and selfish woman named Martha diabolically plots with her bumbling young lover, Franz, to kill her unsuspecting husband and Franz\u2019s uncle, Dreyer.\r\n\u00a0\r\nField has traced the inspiration for this story to an obscure Hans Christian Andersen tale of the same name, in which a pack of cards fights a revolution. \u201cWhile Nabokov\u2019s story apparently has little to do with Andersen\u2019s, it is presumably no accident that the novel has 13 chapters, the number of cards in a suit. The characters are two-dimensional, like cards, and the variations on a conventional plot suggest that the novel is one permutation of dealing a hand,\u201d wrote Charles Nicol in the Atlantic. Another acknowledged literary source for the novel is Gustave Flaubert\u2019s Madame Bovary, which King, Queen, Knave burlesques. New York Times Book Review contributor Philip Toynbee noted that \u201cwith both women one has the same oppressive sense of fate hanging heavily over their heads.\u201d The force controlling Martha\u2019s fate is, of course, the author, and Nabokov uses this power to manipulate the narrative in unexpected ways. Although he patterns his tale on a situation common to many novels, \u201cnothing ends as it\u2019s supposed to,\u201d according to Washington Post reviewer Geoffrey Wolff. Wolff thought the novel \u201cabounds in comic incongruities: Martha is cold, selfish, aloof and beautiful, yet Nabokov has her slip into passionate love with a bumbling, graceless post-adolescent hayseed. Their rendezvous are made in a grubby comic-opera parody of a clerk\u2019s garret as it might be imagined in a nineteenth-century Russian novel.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nWith each new novel published, Nabokov garnered increased attention within the \u00e9migr\u00e9 community; still unknown to the public at large, however, he was forced to supplement his writing income with outside work. Between 1922 and 1937 he earned a living by tutoring, translating, performing as an extra in films, and, as his reputation spread, by giving literary readings of his poems and prose. The Berlin years were still a time of material impoverishment, as Field noted in Vladimir Nabokov: His Life in Part: \u201cIn September 1935 after Nabokov was praised in print for the first time in the United States \u2026 [he] wrote to his mother: \u2014\u2018In the New York Times they write \u2018our age has been enriched by the appearance of a great writer,\u2019 but I don\u2019t have a decent pair of trousers, and I quite don\u2019t know what I shall wear to Belgium where PEN has invited me to read.\u2019\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nFurther hardships followed. In 1937 Nabokov left Berlin for Paris, accompanied by his wife Vera, who was Jewish, and Dmitri, his only child. In escaping the hostile political climate of Nazi Germany, Nabokov was also shifting to what appeared to be a more stimulating ambience, for Paris had superseded Berlin as the \u00e9migr\u00e9 lodestar. Despite its status as a Russian cultural center, Paris proved disappointing, for even here \u00e9migr\u00e9 writing seemed ingrown and stale. Increasingly, Nabokov found himself without a proper audience for his Russian work. Writing of \u00e9migr\u00e9 Paris in the late 1930s, Field described this decline: \u201cThe literature existed, but it had no resonance, or at best one so circumscribed that it could be calculated not even in thousands but in hundreds of readers. The old combinations by which a livelihood might be put together in ways more or less directly connected with literature were less possible now.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAround this time, Nabokov began to experiment with English, translating his Russian novel Otchayaniye into the English Despair in 1937. Initially hesitant about his command of the language, Nabokov requested the assistance of a professional to proofread his work. H.G. Wells was recommended but never materialized; a second candidate bowed out, declaring himself unsuited to the work. Finally, an Englishwoman agreed to make corrections, but when her list of recommendations was completed, Nabokov found it spurious. \u201cAll of this stuff is completely insignificant, for any Russian reader can find just as many birthmarks on any page of any of my Russian novels, and any good English writer commits just as many grammatical imprecisions,\u201d he wrote in a letter to Vera, quoted in Vladimir Nabokov: His Life in Part. The book was published exactly as he wrote it, an event significant in the writer\u2019s life, according to Field, \u201cbecause it is part of that process of metamorphosis which was in a few years to \u2026 make him an English writer. After he had done that translation, he knew he could do it.\u201d Indeed, his very next book, The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, was written in English and marks the demise of the pseudonymous V. Sirin and the emergence of Vladimir Nabokov, an American writer.\r\n\u00a0\r\nRegarded as one of Nabokov\u2019s lesser accomplishments, The Real Life of Sebastian Knight struck New Republic correspondent Conrad Brenner as \u201cthe most perverse novel you are ever likely to encounter. This book is quite openly a literary trick, astounding in [its] sleek deceitful contours.\u201d Filled with autobiographical tidbits and typically Nabokovian allusions to chess, The Real Life of Sebastian Knight chronicles the narrator\u2019s search for the \u201cessence\u201d of his half-brother, the titular Sebastian Knight\u2014a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 writer who died an early death in relative obscurity. The brothers had been out of touch for years, but V., the narrator, remains convinced of Sebastian\u2019s genius and sets out to write a biography that will insure his brother\u2019s critical stature and refute a second-rate biography Sebastian\u2019s former secretary has published. Rather than clarifying the details of Sebastian\u2019s life, however, V.\u2019s search only raises more questions. The book draws to a close with V. retrospectively visiting Sebastian on his death bed and wondering whether perhaps he is himself Sebastian Knight, or whether Sebastian might be a third person unknown to them both.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhile composed largely in the sunlit bathroom of Nabokov\u2019s Paris flat, The Real Life of Sebastian Knight was published in the United States in 1941, a year after Nabokov and his family arrived in New York City, in flight from Hitler\u2019s terror. During the first years of his U.S. residency, Nabokov worked in obscurity at several part-time jobs. His knowledge of butterflies won him a coveted position as a research fellow at Harvard\u2019s Museum of Comparative Zoology, and he also received a guest lectureship at Wellesley College, though he was never offered tenure, partly because his anti-Soviet sentiments were suspect during the Russo-American alliance of World War II. Nabokov lived in rented quarters and never purchased his own home, but he eventually settled at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he was considered an inspiring if somewhat eccentric teacher. He delivered his lectures from carefully prepared diagrams and notes, many of which were been published posthumously in Lectures on Literature.\r\n\u00a0\r\nNabokov might have continued quietly lecturing to what he once called, in Playboy, \u201cthe great fraternity of C-minus, backbone of the nation,\u201d but for the publication of a novel that would make his name an unpronounceable household word. \u201cThe first little throb of Lolita went through me late in 1939 or early in 1940 in Paris, at a time when I was laid up with a severe attack of intercostal neuralgia,\u201d Nabokov wrote in an appendix to the novel. The inspiration was a newspaper story about the first ape to have produced a drawing, a pathetic sketch of the bars of his cage. The text had no direct connection to the story that followed, but nonetheless resulted in what Nabokov called \u201ca prototype\u201d of Lolita; namely, a Russian tale of 50 typewritten pages. Unhappy with the story, Nabokov abandoned the work (later rediscovered, translated, and posthumously published as The Enchanter), but \u201caround 1949, in Ithaca, upstate New York, the throbbing, which had never quite ceased, began to plague me again.\u201d By then, however, \u201cthe thing was new and had grown in secret the claws and wings of a novel.\u201d Within a few years, Nabokov had completed Lolita.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe publishing history of this extraordinary book has been documented in thousands of words by writers on both sides of the Atlantic. Completed in 1954, Nabokov\u2019s manuscript was rejected by each of the four U.S. publishers to whom he submitted it. A book that chronicled the seduction of a 12-year-old girl by a middle-aged man was regarded as a publishing risk, though certain editors did offer some recommendations. \u201cGrotesque improvements were suggested. \u2026 such as that Lolita be changed into a boy,\u201d stated F.W. Dupee in Encounter. Rather than compromise his art, Nabokov turned to Olympia Press, a Paris-based publisher best known for pornography. Banned in France along with other \u201cobscene\u201d Olympia publications, Lolita surfaced in America, where it was deemed unobjectionable by U.S. Customs agents. This ironic turn of events captured the attention of the international press, who headlined the story at home and abroad. Before long, the French ban was rescinded, the book was brought out in hardback by the respectable G.P. Putnam & Sons, and Lolita began its ascent on the bestseller lists.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe novel purports to be the true confession of a middle-aged debaucher who chooses the pseudonym Humbert Humbert because it \u201cexpresses the nastiness best.\u201d Jailed for the murder of his rival, Humbert seeks to purge himself by recounting his tale, though the reader is warned in a mock preface by an obtuse Freudian psychiatrist that Humbert can never be absolved. Nor is his tone \u201cthe characteristic whine of the penitent,\u201d but rather, as New Yorker contributor Donald Malcolm observed, \u201can artful modulation of lyricism and jocularity that quickly seduces the reader into something very like willing complicity.\u201d In eloquent detail, Humbert describes his lust for that species of prepubescent girls he calls \u201cnymphets\u201d and for 12-year-old Dolores Haze in particular. In order to be near his beloved Lolita, as Dolores is called, Humbert marries her mother, then finds his dream fulfilled when she dies in an auto accident, leaving him as the child\u2019s guardian. He is somewhat chagrined to discover, on their first night alone, that Lolita is a more experienced lover than he. \u201cTheir weird affair\u2014which carries them on a frenzied motel-hopping trek around the [North] American continent\u2014is climaxed by Lolita\u2019s escape with a playwright and Humbert\u2019s eventual revenge on his rival,\u201d Charles Rolo wrote in the Atlantic.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWith its theme of perversion, Lolita provoked a moralistic outcry from some conservative critics, such as a Catholic World reviewer who believed the \u201cvery subject matter makes it a book to which grave objection must he raised.\u201d A Kirkus Reviews critic also recommended that it be banished from the open shelves: \u201cThat a book like this could be written\u2014published here\u2014sold, presumably over the counters, leaves one questioning the [country\u2019s] ethical and moral standards. \u2026 Any librarian surely will question this for anything but the closed shelves.\u201d A Library Journal critic urged equal caution, noting that \u201cthousands of library patrons conditioned to near-incest by \u2018Peyton Place\u2019 may take this in stride. However, better read before buying. Although the writer prides himself on using no obscene words, he succeeds only too well in conveying his meaning without them.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nFor every critic who attacked the book, there were dozens who applauded it, however. San Francisco Chronicle contributor Lewis Vogler deemed the novel \u201can authentic work of art which compels our immediate response,\u201d and Conrad Brenner called it \u201ca work clearly foreshadowed in the body of [Nabokov\u2019s] prose, and the high water mark of his career as agent provocateur.\u201d\n\r\nWhile Nabokov paid little notice to most interpretations of Lolita, he reacted strongly against readers who envisioned the story as a satiric criticism of his adopted land. \u201cWhether or not critics think that in Lolita I am ridiculing human folly leaves me supremely indifferent. But I am annoyed when the glad news is spread that I am ridiculing America,\u201d he told Alvin Toffler in Playboy. In another interview excerpted in the Washington Post, Nabokov asserted that \u201cAmerica is the only country where I feel emotionally and mentally at home.\u201d Nonetheless, with the proceeds from Lolita, Nabokov moved to the Palace Hotel in Switzerland, abandoning his teaching completely and devoting his time to writing and collecting butterflies. His reasons, he told Toffler, were \u201cpurely private\u201d\u2014for one thing, most of his family remained in Europe, for another, he was comfortable with the ambience there.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn Montreux, the 60 year-old Nabokov continued to write, often standing at a lectern in his room and recording his thoughts in longhand on specially ordered index cards. One of his first projects was to resume work on a novel that had been interrupted by the war. Published as Pale Fire, this difficult work demonstrates the increased emphasis on form and structure that dominated Nabokov\u2019s later fiction. \u201cMore than any other of his books, Pale Fire lives up to his dictum that \u2018Art is never simple. \u2026 Because, of course, art at its greatest is fantastically deceitful and complex,\u2019\u201d John Hagopian reported in the Dictionary of Literary Biography. This complexity frustrated many would-be readers and led New York Times Book Review contributor George Cloyne to dismiss Pale Fire as a \u201ccuriosity \u2026 one more proof of Mr. Nabokov\u2019s rare vitality. Unluckily it is not much more than that.\u201d Christian Science Monitor contributor Roderick Nordell was less circumspect, judging the book \u201ca prodigal waste of its author\u2019s gifts.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\nPale Fire consists of a 999-line poem in four cantos, composed by the late John Shade, an American poet recently assassinated by a madman\u2019s bullet, and a foreword, commentary, and index contributed by Dr. Charles Kinbote, an \u00e9migr\u00e9 scholar of dubious sanity. Since Kinbote\u2019s footnotes are keyed to various lines in the poem, the reader cannot simply read the book from cover to cover, but must continually flip back and forth from the commentary to the verse. \u201cThis is not the drudgery it may sound, for every vibration of the pages carries the reader to a fresh illumination, a further delight,\u201d wrote Donald Malcolm in the New Yorker. \u201cBut on the other hand, it is not reading in the ordinary sense. It more nearly resembles the manipulation of a pencil along a course of numbered dots until the hidden picture stands forth, compact, single, and astonishing.\u201d Noted Mary McCarthy in the New Republic: \u201cWhen the separate parts are assembled, according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions, and fitted together with the help of clues and cross-references, which must be hunted down as in a paperchase, a novel on several levels is revealed.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nFor some critics, this elaborate mechanism tended to overshadow the story. \u201cIndeed the structure is so witty, and so obtrusive, that it threatens constantly to become its own end; and we are made to attend so closely to it that the novel itself seems wholly subordinate to its mode of enclosure,\u201d Nation contributor Saul Madoff contended. Writing in the Saturday Review, William Peden was equally unenthusiastic, noting: \u201cFor [those] who feel that a container is more important than the contents within it, Pale Fire will perhaps be considered a masterpiece. But for us less sophisticated mortals it must be reckoned with as withdrawn from humanity, grotesque and definitely diseased, as monstrous as a three-headed calf.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nFaced with the same material, Mary McCarthy reached a very different conclusion. She called Pale Fire \u201ca Jack-in-the-box, a Faberge gem, a clockwork toy, a chess problem, an infernal machine, a trap to catch reviewers, a cat-and-mouse game, a do-it-yourself novel. \u2026 This centaur-work of Nabokov\u2019s, half poem, half prose, this merman of the deep, is a creation of perfect beauty, symmetry, strangeness, originality, and moral truth. Pretending to be a curio, it cannot disguise the fact that it is one of the very great works of art of this century, the modern novel that everyone thought dead and that was only playing possum.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn his 70th year, Nabokov produced his last major work, Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle, a sexually explicit tale of incest, twice as long as any other novel he had written and, according to Leonard in the New York Times, \u201cfourteen times as complicated.\u201d An immediate best seller, Ada or Ardor evoked a wide array of critical response, ranging from strong objections to the highest praise. While the value of the novel was debated, Ada or Ardor was universally acknowledged as a work of enormous ambition, the culmination of all Nabokov had attempted to accomplish in his writing over the years. \u201cAda is the fullest realization of the program for the novel articulated in 1941 in Nabokov\u2019s first English book, The Real Life of Sebastian Knight,\u201d explained Robert Alter in Commentary. Like the character Sebastian who described his attempt to \u201cuse parody as a kind of springboard for leaping into the highest region of serious emotion,\u201d Nabokov, through his bristling word play, attempted to illuminate \u201cin new depth and breadth the relation between art, reality, and the evanescent ever-never presence of time past.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nOn the surface, Ada or Ardor chronicles the incestuous love affair between Van Veen and his cousin (soon revealed to be his sister) Ada, who fall in love as adolescents, embark upon a blissful sexual odyssey, are pulled apart by social taboo and circumstance, only to be reunited in late middle age, at which time they prosper together until both are in their 90s. \u201cNabokov sums up these amorous doings in a mock dust-jacket blurb that closes Ada by describing only the book\u2019s most superficial aspects,\u201d observed a Time reviewer. \u201cLong before he gets around to that, though, a suspicion has set in that the surface love story is as different from the real Ada as a bicycle reflector is from a faceted ruby.\u201d Van\u2019s memoir of his love affair with Ada, ostensibly \u201cVan\u2019s book,\u201d is actually an anagram for \u201cNabokov\u2019s,\u201d and \u201conce the creator\u2019s name has been uttered, Ada\u2019s profoundest purpose comes into view. \u2026 Ada is the supreme fictional embodiment of Nabokov\u2019s lifelong, bittersweet preoccupation with time and memory,\u201d the Time reviewer concluded.\n\r\nAlthough Nabokov continued writing well into the 1970s, his last books are considered minor additions to his oeuvre. However, The Stories of Vladimir Nabokov would prove a fitting coda to his work. Translated with the help of the author\u2019s son Dmitri and published in 1995, Stories spans the 20th century. The first of its 65 entries dates from 1921\u2014a year before the then 21-year-old Cambridge student\u2019s father was killed\u2014while the most recent, \u201cLance,\u201d dates from 1952, a few years prior to Nabokov\u2019s publication of Lolita. Eleven of the early works, including 1921\u2019s \u201cThe Wood-Sprite,\u201d Nabokov\u2019s first published short story, appear in English translation for the first time; 13 were never before been collected. As Anthony Lane remarked in the New Yorker, the collection \u201coffers a startling, cloudless view of a writer\u2019s development.\u201d Rather than slowly developing from a novice talent, Nabokov proved in his early fictions to be \u201ca young man who is not only gifted, and serenely confident in that gift, but more than able to hold his own against the sage celebrity that he finally became,\u201d according to Lane. The theme of happiness runs throughout the book, as it did through all the author\u2019s work, according to Tatyana Tolstaya in the Los Angeles Times Book Review. \u201cEven the saddest, most tragic stories\u2014about death, loss, and betrayal\u2014are written so that the reader is left with the distinct foretaste of happiness, as if happiness were the genuine lining, the inside of being, which shines through the gloomy patchwork of reality,\u201d the critic maintained. \u201cThose who know Nabokov the novelist and have forgotten that Nabokov the story writer exists now have a precious gift.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nWorks by Nabokov continued to be published decades after his death due to the translation efforts of his son Dmitri. Nabokov\u2019s Butterflies: Unpublished and Uncollected Writings, released in 2000, demonstrates Nabokov\u2019s vast scientific knowledge of butterflies and moths, as well as his passion for discovering new species. Indeed, several species of butterfly in the American West bear the author\u2019s name because Nabokov was the first to find and describe them. London Times contributor Mark Ridley stated: \u201cThe anthology is more of a source-book than one to read cover-to-cover, but, if it is read as a whole, it provides a picture not only of Nabokov\u2019s scientific contributions but also of the relation between his science, his writing and his life. \u2026 One point that the editors wish to make is that Nabokov was not some lightweight dabbler, but a scientist who can be judged by professional standards.\u201d A Publishers Weekly reviewer styled the work \u201ca volume devotees will delight to browse in and scholars will want to own.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nMore than 30 years after his death, Nabokov\u2019s son edited and released The Original of Laura (Dying Is Fun). The volume is a novel manuscript that Nabokov was working on during the 1970s. Although Nabokov instructed his heirs to burn his notes, they instead compiled them into a loose story that portrays Flora, who is sexualized as a young girl, much like her counterpart in Lolita. As an adult, Flora\u2019s ex-lover writes a memoir of their affair, but the book mostly provides readers with insight into Nabokov\u2019s creative process. Scans of Nabokov\u2019s note cards are included in the volume, and they reveal his self-editing and marginal commentary. As New York writer Sam Anderson remarked: \u201cEvery page contains the author\u2019s surprising handwriting: biggish and slanted and loopy, with generous white space around his words. (I was expecting, for some reason, tiny cramped writing that colonized every available millimeter of space.) Some of the cards are heavily revised, which allows us to see, for the first time, the work of Nabokov\u2019s famous eraser: fuzzy little storm clouds of smudged graphite loom behind neatly rewritten words. It\u2019s a fascinating read on many levels. If Knopf were to publish a series of painstakingly reproduced Nabokov manuscripts, I\u2019d pawn my Kindle to buy them all.\u201d Anderson then went on to note that The Original of Laura (Dying Is Fun) is \u201ca showpiece of intelligent book design built on a deep respect for the manuscript.\u201d According to Lev Grossman in Time, \u201cfor readers who are devoted to Nabokov (I\u2019m one), The Original of Laura affords its own ecstasies. It comes at you as a reprieve, a final appearance from an old friend you thought was already gone for good. It\u2019s a shambles, a heap of shards, but they\u2019re Nabokov\u2019s shards and no one else\u2019s a beautiful ruin, like the Venus de Milo, not a novel. To pretend otherwise is wishful thinking.\u201d Barbara Hoffert, writing in Library Journal, felt that \u201cpop readers titillated by mention of Lolita won\u2019t get it, but serious readers and scholars will definitely want to read and ponder.\u201d\nIn 2012, Nabokov\u2019s Selected Poems was published. Heralded as a major literary event, the volume reminded readers, according to its editor, Thomas Karshan, that Nabokov was \u201cfirst a poet.\u201d Though Nabokov primarily wrote poetry in Russian, the book includes poems that \u201cbounce off his novels with such spring and regularity it can render the deep fan gleeful,\u201d noted Lawrence Frascella on NPR. \u201cWe catch glimpses of Lolitas, Pnins and John Shades from Pale Fire. We trip across shrewd Nabokovian jokes (the florist\u2019s wife named Mrs. Deforest) and wonderful wordplay (\u2018the ABC of the abyss\u2019).\u201d In the New York Times, David Orr remarked that \u201cat his best, Nabokov writes a delicate, knowing poetry of crystalline surfaces and twisty depths.\u201d But Nabokov\u2019s greatest poem, Orr contends, is the 999-line poem that is the centerpiece of Pale Fire; indeed, the poem was published in a stand-along edition as Pale Fire: A Poem in Four Cantos by John Shade by Gingko Press in 2011. Weighing in on the debate as to whether \u201cPale Fire\u201d is a poem, or a poem written \u201cby\u201d Nabokov, Orr maintained that lyric poets have long used personae: \u201cNo poem is ever on its own,\u201d Orr claims. \u201cAnd the poem is not Nabokov\u2019s any more than it is John Shade\u2019s. \u2018Pale Fire\u2019 is a voice within a voice\u2014a mirrored and thoroughly modern sensibility. And that sensibility, whatever name we give it, is one hell of a poet.\u201d\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Russia"]}}
