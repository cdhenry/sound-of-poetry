Following the war, he founded the Realist Writers Group.\u00a0\nHis work is known for his use of conventional forms and war themes, and Manifold has been recognized for his attempts to reinvigorate the traditional Australian bush ballad. In addition to being a poet, he was an avid critic and musician and published essays on realism and recorder technique.\nAfter returning to Australia in 1949, Manifold worked primarily on songs and ballads before his death in Brisbane in 1985.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Australia"]}}
