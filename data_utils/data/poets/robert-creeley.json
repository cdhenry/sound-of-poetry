His poetry is noted for both its concision and emotional power. Albert Mobilio, writing in the\u00a0Voice Literary Supplement,\u00a0observed: \u201cCreeley has shaped his own audience. The much imitated, often diluted minimalism, the compression of emotion into verse in which scarcely a syllable is wasted, has decisively marked a generation of poets.\u201d\nCreeley was born in Arlington, Massachusetts in 1926. When his father died in 1930, he was raised by his mother and sister in Acton. An accident when he was four left him blind in one eye. He attended Holderness School in Plymouth, New Hampshire, on a scholarship, and his articles and stories appeared regularly in the school\u2019s literary magazine. Creeley entered Harvard College in 1943, but admitted later that he had felt discouraged by \u201cthe sardonic stance of my elders.\u201d He left Harvard to serve in the American Field Service in 1944 and 1945, and drove an ambulance in India and Southeast Asia. Creeley returned to Harvard after the war, though he never graduated. He later received an MA from the University of New Mexico. He began corresponding with\u00a0William Carlos Williams, who seems to have put him in touch with\u00a0Charles Olson, a poet who was to have a substantial influence on the direction of his future work. Excited especially by Olson\u2019s ideas about literature, Creeley began to develop a distinctive and unique poetic style.\nThroughout the 1950s, Creeley was associated with the \u201cBlack Mountain Poets,\u201d a group of writers including\u00a0Denise Levertov, Ed Dorn, Fielding Dawson, and others who had some connection with Black Mountain College, an experimental, communal college in North Carolina that was a haven for many innovative writers and artists. Creeley edited the\u00a0Black Mountain Review\u00a0and developed a close and lasting relationship with Olson, the rector of the college. The two engaged in a lengthy, intensive correspondence about literary matters that has been collected and published in ten volumes as\u00a0Charles Olson and Robert Creeley: The Complete Correspondence\u00a0(Volume 1, 1980).\u00a0Olson and Creeley together developed the concept of \u201cprojective verse,\u201d a kind of poetry that abandoned traditional forms in favor of a freely constructed verse that took shape as the process of composing it was underway. Olson called this process \u201ccomposition by field,\u201d and his famous essay on the subject, \u201cProjective Verse,\u201d was as important for the poets of the emerging generation as\u00a0T.S. Eliot\u2019s \u201cTradition and the Individual Talent\u201d was to the poets of the previous generation. Olson credited Creeley with formulating one of the basic principles of this new poetry: the idea that \u201cform is never more than an extension of content.\u201d\nCreeley was a leader in the generational shift that veered away from history and tradition as primary poetic sources and gave new prominence to the ongoing experiences of an individual\u2019s life. Because of this emphasis, the major events of his life loom large in his literary work. Creeley\u2019s marriage to Ann MacKinnon ended in divorce in 1955. The breakup of that relationship is chronicled in fictional form in his only novel,\u00a0The Island\u00a0(1963),\u00a0which drew upon his experiences on the island of Mallorca, off the coast of Spain, where he lived with MacKinnon and their three children in 1953 and 1954. After the divorce Creeley returned to Black Mountain College for a brief time before moving west. He was in San Francisco during the flowering of what became known as the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance, and he also became associated for a time with some of the writers of the Beat Generation, including Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Michael McClure, and others. His work appeared in the influential anthology\u00a0The New American Poetry: 1945-1960\u00a0 (1960),\u00a0edited by Donald Allen.\nIn 1956 Creeley accepted a teaching position at a boys\u2019 school in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he met his second wife, Bobbie Louise Hall. Though Creeley published poetry and fiction throughout the 1950s and 1960s and had even established his own imprint, the Divers Press, in 1952, his work did not receive important national recognition until Scribner published his first major collection,\u00a0For Love: Poems 1950-1960,\u00a0in 1962. This book collected work that he had been issuing in small editions and magazines during the previous decade. When\u00a0For Love\u00a0debuted, Mobilio wrote, \u201cit was recognized at once as a pivotal contribution to the alternative poetics reshaping the American tradition. \u2026 The muted, delicately contrived lyrics \u2026 were personal and self-contained; while they drew their life from the everyday, their techniques of dislocation sprang from the mind\u2019s naturally stumbled syntax.\u201d\nThe very first poem in\u00a0For Love,\u00a0\u201cHart Crane,\u201d with its unorthodox, Williams-like line breaks, its nearly hidden internal rhymes, and its subtle assonance and sibilance, announces the Creeley style\u2014a style defined by an intense concentration on the sounds and rhythms of language as well as the placement of the words on the page. In a piece for the\u00a0London Review of Books,\u00a0Stephanie Burt\u00a0wrote that \u201cWe recognise Creeley\u2019s poems first by what they leave out: he uses few long or rare words, no regular metres and almost no metaphors,\u201d and, noting how little that style changed, \u201cCreeley kept for five decades a way of writing whose markers include parsimonious diction, strong enjambment, two to four-line stanzas and occasional rhyme. What changed over his career was not his language but the use he made of it, the attitudes and goals around which the small, clear crystals of his verse might form.\u201d\nThough\u00a0For Love\u00a0and\u00a0Words\u00a0(1967) both received critical acclaim, by the late \u201960s Creeley was already abandoning the spare style which had made him famous. In\u00a0Pieces,\u00a0A Day Book,\u00a0Thirty Things,\u00a0and\u00a0Hello: A Journal, February 29-May 3, 1976,\u00a0all published between 1968 and 1978, Creeley attempts to break down the concept of a \u201csingle poem\u201d by offering his readers sequential, associated fragments of poems with indeterminate beginnings and endings. All of these works are energized by the same heightened attention to the present that characterizes Creeley\u2019s earlier work, and many of the poems in\u00a0Hello\u00a0(1976) refer to the last days of Creeley\u2019s relationship with his second wife, Bobbie. That marriage ended in divorce in 1976, the same year he met Penelope Highton, his third wife, while traveling in New Zealand. For all of Creeley\u2019s experimentation, he has always been in some ways an exceedingly domestic poet; his mother, children, wives, and close friends are the subjects of his best work. Because Creeley\u2019s second marriage lasted nearly 20 years, the sense of a major chunk of his life drifting away from him is very strong in\u00a0Hello.\u00a0Creeley here conveys the traumatic emotional state that almost always accompanies the breakup of long-term relationships.\nCreeley\u2019s next major collection,\u00a0Later\u00a0(1979),\u00a0is characterized by a greater emphasis on memory, a new sense of life\u2019s discrete phases, and an intense preoccupation with aging. In \u201cMyself,\u201d the first poem in\u00a0Later,\u00a0he writes: \u201cI want, if older, / still to know / why, human, men / and women are / so torn, so lost / why hopes cannot / find a better world / than this.\u201d This futile but deeply human quest captures the spirit of Creeley\u2019s later work. It embodies a commonly shared realization: one becomes older but still knows very little about essential aspects of life, particularly the mysteries of human relationships. The 10-part title poem was written over a period of 10 days in September of 1977. The poem begins by evoking lost youth and presents a kaleidoscopic view of Creeley\u2019s life, both past and present: a lost childhood dog and memories of his mother, friends and neighbors are all mapped onto the poetry he is composing in an attic room in Buffalo in September 1977.\nThe Collected Poems of Robert Creeley, 1945-1975\u00a0was published in 1982. The poems Creeley wrote in the last decades of his life increasingly remember and reflect on memory and the past. As Stephanie Burt described them: \u201cThe later poems are more traditional than their predecessors, in their sounds and in their goals. They rhyme more often. They have recognisable closure. Few are so short as to pose conceptual puzzles about what a poem is. When they are bad they are prosy or repetitive, not insubstantial or nonsensical. They never sound like Olson (much less like Ginsberg), and at their best they recall\u00a0Thomas Hardy: they are, in the end, mostly poems of old age.\u201d\u00a0Life and Death\u00a0(1998) examines the poet\u2019s increasing age and mortality. Reviewing the book,\u00a0Forrest Gander\u00a0acknowledged Creeley\u2019s lasting importance to American poetry: \u201cRobert Creeley has forged a signature style in American poetry, an idiosyncratic, highly elliptical, syntactical compression by which the character of his mind\u2019s concentrated and stumbling proposals might be expressed \u2026 Reading his poems, we experience the gnash of arriving through feeling at thought and word.\u201d\nCreeley was a prolific poet, even late in life: the volumes after\u00a0Life and Death\u00a0came in regular succession, including\u00a0Loops: Ten Poems\u00a0(1995);\u00a0Ligeia: A Libretto\u00a0(1996);\u00a0So There: Poems 1976-83\u00a0(1998);\u00a0En Famille: A Poem by Robert Creeley\u00a0(1999); Thinking(2000);\u00a0Just In Time: Poems, 1984-1994\u00a0(2001); and\u00a0If I Were Writing This\u00a0(2003). R. D. Pohl in the\u00a0Buffalo News,\u00a0praised\u00a0If I Were Writing This, declaring that it \u201ccontains some of the starkest and most memorable poems Creeley has written.\u201d Pohl and a\u00a0Publishers Weekly\u00a0reviewer both saw\u00a0If I Were Writing This\u00a0as a companion volume to\u00a0Life and Death,\u00a0each of them \u201ccomposed primarily of poems dedicated to family and friends (dead and living), collaborative verses, and such poems as \u2018For You\u2019 in which intimacy of tone coincides with cryptic, lyrical abstraction.\u201d Pohl noted that\u00a0If I Were Writing This\u00a0is the first major volume to appear since Creeley joined the ranks of such poetic giants as\u00a0Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams,\u00a0Wallace Stevens\u00a0and\u00a0John Ashbery\u00a0by winning the prestigious Yale University Bollingen Prize in 1999. He continued: \u201cThe fragility of our common experience in language and the world resonates through every line of Creeley\u2019s recent work.\u201d\nCreeley also wrote a considerable amount of prose and was editor of a number of volumes, including\u00a0Best American Poetry 2002.\u00a0Creeley\u2019s prose works include a novel, essays, and short stories, as well as a play, collected letters, and an autobiography, published in 1990. Creeley taught for over 30 years at the State University of New York-Buffalo, helping to turn its English and Poetics program into one of the most famous havens for avant-garde writing in the world. In 2003 he was appointed distinguished professor of English at Brown University. In an appreciation of Creeley written for the Poetry Project Newsletter,\u00a0Peter Gizzi\u00a0said, \u201cHe was a devoted teacher, undeterred by the persistent critique of the role of poets in universities. Conversely, on the Black Mountain model, he was more interested in bending institutions to support poetry. That was one of his labors.\u201d\u00a0Also noted for his enthusiastic support of other poets, Robert Creeley served as a mentor and friend to many, many poets.\u00a0Charles Bernstein, a colleague of Creeley\u2019s at SUNY-Buffalo wrote in the\u00a0Brooklyn Rail: \u201cSo many poets had an intimate relation with Creeley; he had a way of connecting with each of us in particular and, through that connection with him, to a company of poets in the U.S. and around the world.\u201d Creeley died in 2005 in Odessa, Texas, of complications resulting from lung disease. He had been completing a residency for the Lannan Foundation in Marfa, Texas.\nDon Byrd quoted him in\u00a0Contemporary Poets:\u00a0\u201cI write to realize the world as one has come to live in it, thus to give testament. I write to move in\u00a0words,\u00a0a human delight. I write when no other act is possible.\u201d Asked about \u201cgood\u201d poems, Creeley, who had written in the introduction to\u00a0Best American Poetry 2002\u00a0that the poem is \u201cthat place we are finally safe in\u201d where \u201cunderstanding is not a requirement. You don\u2019t have to know why. Being there is the one requirement,\u201d responded, \u201cIf one only wrote \u2018good\u2019 poems, what a dreary world it would be.\u201d\nCreeley died in 2005, in Odessa, Texas, at the age of 78.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"], "School/Period:": ["Black Mountain"]}}
