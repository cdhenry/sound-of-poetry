She earned her BA from the University of Chicago and MFA from the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. Garrigue lived for many years in New York City, where she worked as an editor and taught writing at institutions including Bard College, Queen\u2019s College, the New School, the University of Colorado, Smith College, and the University of Washington, among other places. She published five collections of poetry\u2014including her widely-praised first collection The Ego and the Centaur (1947)\u2014and one novella, The Animal Hotel (1966), in her lifetime; her posthumously published books included Studies for an Actress and Other Poems (1973) and Selected Poems (1992). She also edited the anthology Translations by American Poets (1970) and wrote a critical work on Marianne Moore. Garrigue was the recipient of fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Radcliffe Institute, and the National Academy of Arts and Letters.\nCritics praised Garrigue\u2019s technical excellence as well as what Theodore Roethke called her \u201ccomplex richness in rhythm and diction.\u201d She \u201cis ardent in the invention of new phrases, is a rare perfectionist of attitudes, a poet habituated to verbal elegance,\u201d stated Richard Eberhart. Praising her skill and freshness, a Saturday Review critic called her \u201cundeniably original and individual as an artist, and a craftsman in complete command of her medium.\u201d In a review of Garrigue\u2019s New and Selected Poems (1967), a collection of 20 years of her work, Laurence Lieberman said in Poetry magazine that the author \u201cis perhaps more skilled than any other poet writing today with the power to dramatize emotional threshholds between jeopardy and renewal \u2026 In poem after poem her subject is the failure of events in daily life ever to measure up to her spirit\u2019s esthetic craving for perfectability.\u201d\n\r\nGarrigue often wrote love poetry, but her concerns also included travel. Among Garrigue\u2019s most popular were her lengthy travel poems, \u201cFor the Fountains and Fountaineers of Villa d\u2019Este,\u201d \u201cPays Perdu,\u201d and \u201cThe Grand Canyon.\u201d As the author once explained to Contemporary Authors, \u201cI\u2019ve lived and traveled in Europe during three consecutive periods\u20141953-54, 1957-58, and 1962-63. Have taken walking tours in France and Italy, have also done some walking in Vermont \u2026 There was a time when I rode horseback and did some sailing.\u201d Her work reflects other interests, too. She told Contemporary Authors that \u201cmusic is a passion as is Renaissance and gothic architecture. I prefer elaborate structures to functional slick ones. Chopin, Keats, and Proust were early powerful influences. So were mountains and water.\u201d\n\r\nIn Poetry magazine Sandra M. Gilbert remarked that Garrigue\u2019s poetry\u2019s \u201cbrilliant surface glimmers with seductive coruscations that do not conceal but invite the exploration of even more shimmering depths.\u201d And in a New York Times Book Review review of A Water Walk by Villa d\u2019Este (1959), Harvey Shapiro said of the author that \u201cthere are few poets around who command as noble or impressive a style as she has at her best.\u201d Shapiro indicated that Garrigue\u2019s earliest poems were some of her best and most anthologized, explaining that \u201cshe came on the scene with an Elizabethan rhetoric that for all its richness (as if to say, life is that rich) was a perfect mirror of this city and this world.\u201d Stephen Stepanchev described her first collection, The Ego and the Centaur, in his book American Poetry Since 1945, as a work \u201cwith the affecting strangeness of the very individuality it celebrates: it deals with the world everyone knows, and yet it has the otherworldliness of experience raised several degrees above the expected and ordinary. It has a musicality, a refinement, and an elegance of phrase that are appealing and rare. It aims for a fullness of rhetoric reminiscent of the Elizabethans.\u201d\nGarrigue\u2019s first efforts were praised. In the opinion of Henry Rago, The Ego and the Centaur \u201cleaves little doubt of her ability to range in any one of several directions and to learn from a number of people without losing her own identity.\u201d Garrigue\u2019s second collection The Monument Rose (1953) also received praise. In Poetry magazine Harry Roskolenko wrote that, \u201cwhen originality is allied to a critical intelligence and is embedded in the systematic values of poetry, then poetry renews itself and the reader.\u201d Garrigue \u201chas done that, if modestly, with a dignified attitude and an exciting air,\u201d Roskolenko noted. In her review of A Water Walk by Villa d\u2019Este for the New Yorker, Louise Bogan called the lengthy middle section of the book, \u201cFor the Fountains and Fountaineers of Villa d\u2019Este,\u201d \u201ca brilliant display of light, sound, color, and motion that pushes language to its limits.\u201d In Bogan\u2019s opinion, Garrigue is \u201cat her best\u201d when \u201cshe is exuberant to some purpose, spectacular for the right reasons.\u201d\n\nHayden Carruth commented in the Hudson Review that \u201cif they never rise to anything that can be called a pitch, they nevertheless preserve the attractive quietness of steady intellectual warmth. At the same time there can be no doubt that she has a splendid lyrical gift and uses rhyme and meter elegantly.\u201d And in \u201cPays Perdu,\u201d an 11-page long travel poem, the major work of Country without Maps (1964), Garrigue \u201chas produced a poem whose force, I think, has not been equaled in English in recent years,\u201d said Joseph Bennett in the New York Times Book Review.\n\r\nSome found Garrigue\u2019s final work Studies for an Actress and Other Poems less than satisfying. As Alicia Ostriker reported in the New York Times Book Review, here, \u201cthere are many poems in which Garrigue writes almost as finely as ever, in an elegiac mode, poignant with loss of beauty, loss of love and finally loss of life as the major subjects \u2026 Nevertheless the emotions and ideas repeatedly frustrated me by their paleness. Scenes remained vague. I listened for the solid personal voice, kept hearing instead thin echoes of others.\u201d Louis Coxe concluded in the New Republic that, \u201cin this volume though I find a diffuseness and uncertainty that may not have been a matter of \u2018failing powers\u2019 but rather a function of a new start, an engagement with new material. To our loss Jean Garrigue did not live to finish what she began.\u201d\nBut Rosemary Tonks in the New York Review of Books found that in this last book, Garrigue \u201cmade an effort to bring both sensibility and manner up to date.\u201d \u201cPossibly she had at last woken up to the fact that her traditional poetic abilities were strangling her. The mixture is of old and new. But she begins to know herself well enough to hear her own voice.\u201d\nGarrigue died of Hodgkins disease in 1972.\n", "attrs": {}}
