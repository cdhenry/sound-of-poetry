Angel is the author of the poetry collections Anxious Latitudes (1986); Neither World (1995), winner of the James Laughlin Award; Twice Removed (2001); and Exceptions and Melancholies: Poems 1986\u20132006, winner of the 2007 PEN USA Literary Award in Poetry, and Your Moon (2013). His translation of the work of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Poem of the Deep Song (2003), won the Willis Barnstone Translation Prize.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAngel\u2019s spare lyrics are set in an urban landscape that seems timeless, universal, and historical. Reviewer Noah Blaustein commented on the \u201creflective quiet\u201d of the poems, stating that Angel \u201cremoves the poems from their originating subjects and strips down the language to increase their immediacy.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAngel traveled widely in Europe, North Africa, and South America. He commented in the \u201cAfterword\u201d to Poem of the Deep Song: \u201cI come from a household of three languages\u2014Ladino, Hebrew, and English\u2014one that I could understand but not speak, one that I could sing but not understand, and one that is the language of my country, at some distance, always, from my home.\u201d When he came to translate Lorca\u2019s poetry, he noted that he was familiar with the music that the work played homage to: \u201cIt resembled the incantatory medieval singing of the Sephardic synagogue that I grew up in.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAngel received many awards, including a Pushcart Prize, a Fulbright Fellowship, and the Bess Hokin Award of the Modern Poetry Association. He taught at University of Redlands and in the MFA in Writing program at Vermont College of Fine Arts. He lived in Los Angeles for many years, until his death in early 2020.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
