She is the author of Window Left Open (2016), The Needle (2011), and Cusp (2003). The recipient of a Rona Jaffe Foundation Writer\u2019s Award, Grotz has also received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation.\n\r\nIn\u00a0The Needle, Grotz\u00a0explores both Polish and American twentieth-century poetry and its traditions. According to a Washington Post review, \u201cWhere many writers look inward and mine their private landscapes, Grotz sees the objects and scenes around her. . . . Grotz\u2019s perspective makes her work feel objective and insightful, even when she writes about family tragedies. Her ability to balance artistry and emotion results in buoyant poetry.\u201d\u00a0Grotz\u2019s previous collection, Cusp, is informed by the phrase \u201centre chien et loup,\u201d meaning \u201cbetween dog and wolf,\u201d a French colloquialism for twilight. While the poems in Cusp portray a divided world, the poetic project of the book is to locate a cusp, a \u201cnow\u201d moment between past and future, between domestic and foreign, between the random and the inevitable.\u00a0The collection was awarded the 2003 Bakeless Prize and the Best First Book of Poetry Award from the Texas Institute of Letters.\r\n\u00a0\nGrotz has translated the contemporary Psalms of French poet Patrice de La Tour du Pin, collected in\u00a0Psalms of All My Days\u00a0(Carnegie Mellon University Press, 2013), as well as\u2014and in collaboration with Piotr Sommer\u2014a selection of poems by the Polish poet Jerzy Ficowski. She teaches creative writing at the University of Rochester and the Warren Wilson College MFA Program, and she serves as\u00a0the assistant director of the\u00a0Bread Loaf Writers' Conference. \n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
