In 2001, Williams received a New York State Foundation for the Arts Fellowship and returned to Warren Wilson\u2019s low-residency MFA program. In 2004, she won the Prairie Schooner Book Award for Poetry for her book, Adonis Garage. Poet Mark Doty said of Adonis Garage, \u201cYou couldn't ask for a more articulate ars poetica. Williams beats out of difficulty and gorgeousness her own lyrics of pleasure and fury, in poems that sing and lament a fierce urban matrix, where there\u2019s \u2018Mary-rage in the off-duty taxicabs, but God bless/ the satin of born-again swagger.\u2019 Assured and vulnerable, passionate and undeceived, Adonis Garage is a thrilling debut.\u201d She taught English at Bloomfield College in Bloomfield New Jersey. In July of 2009, Williams died in Brooklyn, New York at the age of 47.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
