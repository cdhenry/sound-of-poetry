He attended Middlesex Hospital Medical School for a year before transferring to Waldham College, Oxford University, to study English. Rosen\u2019s first book of children\u2019s poetry was the 1974 Mind Your Own Business, illustrated by Quentin Blake. Through his writing and teaching and as an editor of anthologies, he has helped to make poetry accessible to children.

Often writing in a humorous and honest vein, Rosen has also addressed bereavement, particularly in Sad Book (2004), winner of the Exceptional Award for the Best Children\u2019s Illustrated Books of 2004 (4 to 11 range), and in the prose poem collection Carrying the Elephant: A Memoir of Love and Loss (2002) about his son\u2019s death from meningitis. Rosen was the 2007\u20132009 Waterstone\u2019s children\u2019s laureate; he regularly visits schools to read his poetry and has taught children\u2019s literature at the university level. Recently, he was heard on the BBC\u2019s Word of Mouth program about the English language.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
