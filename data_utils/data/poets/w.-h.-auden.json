Auden grew up in Birmingham, England and was known for his extraordinary intellect and wit. His first book,\u00a0Poems, was published in 1930 with the help of\u00a0T.S. Eliot. Just before World War II broke out, Auden emigrated to the United States where he met the poet Chester Kallman, who became his lifelong lover. Auden won the Pulitzer Prize in 1948 for\u00a0The Age of Anxiety. Much of his poetry is concerned with moral issues and evidences a strong political, social, and psychological context. While the teachings of Marx and Freud weighed heavily in his early work, they later gave way to religious and spiritual influences. Some critics have called Auden an anti-Romantic\u2014a poet of analytical clarity who sought for order, for universal patterns of human existence. Auden\u2019s poetry is considered versatile and inventive, ranging from the tersely epigrammatic to book-length verse, and incorporating a vast range of scientific knowledge. Throughout his career, he collaborated with Christopher Isherwood and\u00a0Louis MacNeice, and also frequently joined with Chester Kallman to create libretti for musical works by Benjamin Britten, Igor Stravinsky, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Today he is considered one of the most skilled and creative mid-20th century poets who regularly wrote in traditional rhyme and meter.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAuden was born and raised in a heavily industrial section of northern England. His father, a prominent physician with an extensive knowledge of mythology and folklore, and his mother, a strict Anglican, both exerted strong influences on Auden\u2019s poetry. Auden\u2019s early interest in science and engineering earned him a scholarship to Oxford University, where his fascination with poetry led him to change his field of study to English. His attraction to science never completely waned, however, and scientific references are frequently found in his poetry. While at Oxford, Auden became familiar with modernist poetry, particularly that of T.S. Eliot. It was also at Oxford that Auden became the pivotal member of a group of writers called the \u201cOxford Group\u201d or the \u201cAuden Generation,\u201d which included\u00a0Stephen Spender, C. Day Lewis, and\u00a0Louis MacNeice. The group adhered to various Marxist and anti-fascist doctrines and addressed social, political, and economic concerns in their writings. Auden\u2019s first book of poetry,\u00a0Poems,\u00a0was privately printed by Stephen Spender in 1928. Critics have noted that Auden\u2019s early verse suggests the influences of\u00a0Thomas Hardy, Laura (Riding) Jackson,\u00a0Wilfred Owen, and\u00a0Edward Thomas. Stylistically, the poems are fragmentary and terse, relying on concrete images and colloquial language to convey Auden\u2019s political and psychological concerns.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAuden\u2019s poems from the second half of the 1930s evidence his many travels during this period of political turmoil. \u201cSpain,\u201d one of his most famous and widely anthologized pieces, is based on his experiences in that country during its civil war of 1936 to 1939.\u00a0Journey to War,\u00a0a book of the period written by Auden with Christopher Isherwood, features Auden\u2019s sonnet sequence and verse commentary, \u201cIn Time of War.\u201d The first half of the sequence recounts the history of humanity\u2019s move away from rational thought, while the second half addresses the moral problems faced by humankind on the verge of another world war. It was Auden who characterized the 30s as \u201cthe age of anxiety.\u201d His 1947 poem by that title, wrote Monroe K. Spears in his\u00a0Poetry of W.H. Auden,\u00a0was a \u201csympathetic satire on the attempts of human beings to escape, through their own efforts, the anxiety of our age.\u201d Auden struck a chord in readers with his timely treatment of the moral and political issues that directly affected them. Harold Bloom suggested in the\u00a0New Republic\u00a0that \u201cAuden [was] accepted as not only a great poet but also a Christian humanist sage not because of any conspiracy among moralizing neo-Christian academicians, but because the age require[d] such a figure.\u201d\n\r\nSome critics have suggested that Auden\u2019s unusual writing style germinated in the social climate of his childhood. Robert Bloom, writing in\u00a0PMLA,\u00a0commented that in Auden\u2019s writing in 1930, \u201cthe omission of articles, demonstrative adjectives, subjects, conjunctions, relative pronouns, auxiliary verbs\u2014form a language of extremity and urgency. Like telegraphese ... it has time and patience only for the most important words.\u201d In his\u00a0W.H. Auden as a Social Poet,\u00a0Frederick Buell identified the roots of this terse style in the private, codified language in which Auden and his circle of schoolboy friends conversed. Buell quoted Christopher Isherwood, one of those friends and later a collaborator with Auden, who described a typical conversation between two members of the group: \u201cWe were each other\u2019s ideal audience; nothing, not the slightest innuendo or the subtlest shade of meaning, was lost between us. A joke which, if I had been speaking to a stranger, would have taken five minutes to lead up to and elaborate and explain, could be conveyed by the faintest hint. ... Our conversation would have been hardly intelligible to anyone who had happened to overhear it; it was a rigamarole of private slang, deliberate misquotations, bad puns, bits of parody, and preparatory school smut.\u201d Peter E. Firchow felt that the nature of Auden\u2019s friendships affected not only his style but also his political views. In\u00a0PMLA,\u00a0Firchow noted that Auden thought of his friends \u201cas a \u2018gang\u2019 into which new members were periodically recruited,\u201d pointing out that Auden, \u201cwhile never a Fascist, came at times remarkably close to accepting some characteristically Fascist ideas, especially those having to do with a mistrust of the intellect, the primacy of the group over the individual, the fascination with a strong leader (who expresses the will of the group), and the worship of youth.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAuden left England in 1939 and became a citizen of the United States. His first book written in America,\u00a0Another Time,\u00a0contains some of his best-known poems, among them \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d and \u201cMusee des Beaux Arts,\u201d which was inspired by a Breughel painting. The volume also contains elegies to poets\u00a0A.E. Housman,\u00a0Matthew Arnold, and\u00a0William Butler Yeats, whose careers and aesthetic concerns had influenced the development of Auden\u2019s artistic credo. A famous line from \u201cIn Memory of W.B. Yeats\u201d is \u201cPoetry makes nothing happen\u201d\u2014suggesting Auden\u2019s complete rejection of romantic ideals. Some critics have suggested that Auden\u2019s concentration on ethical concerns in\u00a0Another Time\u00a0was influenced by his reconversion to Christianity, which he had previously abandoned at age 15. Others, such as John G. Blair (author of\u00a0The Poetic Art of W.H. Auden), however, have cautioned against reading Auden\u2019s personal sentiments into his poetry: \u201cIn none of his poems can one feel sure that the speaker is Auden himself. In the course of his career he has demonstrated impressive facility in speaking through any sort of dramatic persona; accordingly, the choice of an intimate, personal tone does not imply the direct self-expression of the poet.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nFollowing several noted publications,\u00a0The Double Man,\u00a0For the Time Being,\u00a0and\u00a0The Sea and the Mirror,\u00a0Auden\u2019s next volume of verse,\u00a0The Collected Poetry,\u00a0helped to solidify his reputation as a major poet. He won the Pulitzer Prize for his following book,\u00a0The Age of Anxiety: A Baroque Eclogue,\u00a0which features four characters of disparate backgrounds who meet in a New York City bar during World War II. Written in the heavily alliterative style of Old English literature, the poem explores the attempts of the protagonists to comprehend themselves and the world in which they live. Auden\u2019s next major work,\u00a0Nones,\u00a0includes another widely anthologized piece, \u201cIn Praise of Limestone,\u201d which asserts a powerful connection between the landscape depicted and the psychology of Auden\u2019s characters. Auden received a National Book Award in Poetry for\u00a0The Shield of Achilles\u00a0in 1956.\n\r\nAuden possessed a formidable technique and an acute ear. In her book,\u00a0Auden,\u00a0Barbara Everett commented on the poet\u2019s facility: \u201cIn his verse, Auden can argue, reflect, joke, gossip, sing, analyze, lecture, hector, and simply talk; he can sound, at will, like a psychologist on a political platform, like a theologian at a party, or like a geologist in love; he can give dignity and authority to nonsensical theories, and make newspaper headlines sound both true and melodious.\u201d Jeremy Robson noted in\u00a0Encounter: \u201cThe influence of music on Auden\u2019s verse ... has always been salient: even his worst lines often \u2018sound\u2019 impressive.\u201d Everett found that a musical sensibility marked Auden\u2019s work from the very beginning, and she felt that when \u201che turned more and more, in the latter part of his career, to the kind of literary work that demands free exercise of verbal and rhythmic talent\u2014for instance, to the writing of libretti\u2014[he developed] that side of his artistic nature which was from the beginning the strongest.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAuden\u2019s linguistic innovations, renowned enough to spawn the adjective \u201cAudenesque,\u201d were described by Karl Shapiro in\u00a0In Defense of Ignorance\u00a0as \u201cthe modernization of diction, [and] the enlarging of dictional language to permit a more contemporary-sounding speech.\u201d As his career progressed, however, Auden was more often chastised than praised for his idiosyncratic use of language. James Fenton wrote in the\u00a0New Statesman: \u201cFor years\u2014for over forty years\u2014the technical experimentation started by Auden enlarged and enriched the scope of English verse. He rediscovered and invented more than any other modern poet. ... And yet there grew up ... a number of mannerisms, such as the use of nouns as verbs, or the employment of embarrassingly outdated slang, or the ransacking of the\u00a0OED\u00a0[Oxford English Dictionary], which became in the end a hindrance to his work.\u201d\n\r\nThe extent to which Auden believed in various political theories is still debated; what is clear to some critics, though, is that Auden habitually revised his writing to accommodate any shifts in faith. Hannah Arendt considered Auden\u2019s changes of heart to be a natural response to the flux of the times. Arendt wrote in the\u00a0New Yorker: \u201cIn the Forties, there were many who turned against their old beliefs.\u00a0... They simply changed trains, as it were; the train of Socialism and Communism had been wrong, and they changed to the train of Capitalism or Freudianism or some refined Marxism.\u201d\n\u00a0\r\nBuell drew a parallel between the political activism of Auden and that of playwright Bertolt Brecht, noting that both men were \u201cattempting to find an artistic voice for a left-wing polemic.\u201d Arendt supported Buell\u2019s assertion, commenting that \u201c[Auden] once mentioned as a \u2018disease\u2019 his \u2018early addiction to German usages,\u2019 but much more prominent than these, and less easy to get rid of, was the obvious influence of Bertolt Brecht with whom he had more in common than he was ever ready to admit. ... What made this influence possible was that [Auden and Brecht] both belonged to the post-First World War generation, with its curious mixture of despair and\u00a0joie de vivre.\u201d Buell found stylistic as well as political similarities. Bernard Bergonzi, writing in\u00a0Encounter,\u00a0contended that ideologies were only tools to serve Auden\u2019s foremost interest: understanding the workings of the world. For Auden, said Bergonzi, Marxism and psychoanalysis alike were \u201cattractive as techniques of explanation.\u201d Bergonzi posited that Auden perceived reality as \u201cactually or potentially known and intelligible, without mysteries or uncertainty,\u201d and that he considered experience to be a complex entity which could be \u201creduced to classifiable elements, as a necessary preliminary to diagnosis and prescription.\u201d Auden expressed his desire for order in his preface to\u00a0Oxford Poetry 1927: \u201cAll genuine poetry is in a sense the formation of private spheres out of a public chaos.\u201d Bergonzi was one of many critics who felt that Auden succeeded in giving his readers a feeling of the well-ordered \u201cprivate sphere.\u201d He wrote: \u201cAt a time of world economic depression there was something reassuring in Auden\u2019s calm demonstration, mediated as much by style as by content, that reality was intelligible, and could be studied like a map or a catalogue, or seen in temporal terms as an inexorable historical process. ... It was the last time that any British poet was to have such a global influence on poetry in English.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn his later years, Auden wrote three major volumes:\u00a0City without Walls, and Many Other Poems,\u00a0Epistle to a Godson, and Other Poems,\u00a0and the posthumously published\u00a0Thank You, Fog: Last Poems.\u00a0While all three works are noted for their lexical range and humanitarian content, Auden\u2019s later poems often received mixed, and sometimes unenthusiastic, reviews. Commenting on\u00a0Thank You, Fog,\u00a0Howard Moss in\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0argued that the collection is \u201chalf the ghost of what it might have been. Writers, being human, are not in a position to choose their monuments. This one is more Audenesque than Auden, hardly fitting as the final words, the summing up of a man who set his mark on an age.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nSince Auden\u2019s death in 1973, numerous anthologies of his works have been published, leading to reevaluations (and in some respects, the critical rehabilitation) of the poet\u2019s career. Edited by Edward Mendelson,\u00a0W.H. Auden and Chester Kallman: Libretti and Other Dramatic Writings by W.H. Auden, 1939-1973,\u00a0presents a compilation of Auden\u2019s opera libretti, radio plays, film narratives, liturgical dramas, and adaptations of Euripides and Shakespeare, many of which were written in collaboration with Chester Kallman. While the collection points to Auden\u2019s diverse musical and dramatic interests, \u201cthe libretti are rightly the focus of the book,\u201d observed\u00a0J. D. McClatchy\u00a0in\u00a0New Republic.\u00a0McClatchy continued: \u201c[The opera libretto]\u00a0The Rake\u2019s Progress\u00a0remains [Auden and Kallman\u2019s] masterpiece. Simplest verse is the hardest to write, because it is most exposed, and Auden\u2019s spare style here achieves both elegance and speechliness.\u201d Highlighting Auden\u2019s writing partnership with Christopher Isherwood during the early years of their collaboration is Mendelson\u2019s\u00a0W.H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood: Plays and Other Dramatic Writings by W.H. Auden 1928-1938,\u00a0which contains plays, scripts for documentary films and a radio play, and a cabaret act. The plays in the volume, such as\u00a0The Dance of Death\u00a0and\u00a0The Dog Beneath the Skin,\u00a0reveal Auden\u2019s early desire to eschew dramatic realism in favor of the more ritualistic and communal dramatic forms that characterized the Mystery plays of the Middle Ages. The subject matter of the plays nevertheless demonstrates their modern orientation, as political and psychological commentary are of central importance.\r\n\u00a0\r\nEdited by Katherine Bucknell and Nicholas Jenkins (cofounders of the W.H. Auden society), \u201cThe Map of All My Youth:\u201d Early Works, Friends and Influences\u00a0contains several previously unpublished works by Auden, including six poems from the 1930s and an essay by Auden titled \u201cWriting.\u201d The first in a planned series of scholarly books dedicated \u201cnot only to Auden but also [to] his friends and contemporaries, those who influenced him, and those by whom he was influenced,\u201d the volume also contains correspondence between Auden and Stephen Spender and critical essays on Auden by contemporary scholars.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAuden\u2019s milieu is further explored in\u00a0A Company of Readers: Uncollected Writings of W.H. Auden, Jacques Barzun, and Lionel Trilling from the Reader\u2019s Subscription and Mid-Century Book Clubs.\u00a0The book club in question, the Reader\u2019s Subscription Club, later became the Mid-Century Book Club. It was formed in 1951 in an effort to cultivate a readership for literary novels that would not necessarily appeal to mainstream audiences. Auden, Barzun, and Trilling were the club\u2019s editorial board, and the book collects some of their reviews and articles which originally appeared in the club\u2019s periodicals\u2014the\u00a0Griffin\u00a0and the\u00a0Mid-Century.\u00a015 of Auden\u2019s essays are included.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAuden\u2019s relevance to literature continues with the publication of\u00a0Lectures on Shakespeare,\u00a0a collection dating from 1946, when Auden taught a course on Shakespeare at the New School for Social Research in New York City. The lectures were reconstructed from the scrupulous notes taken by Auden\u2019s students, which were then edited by Arthur Kirsch. Auden discusses Shakespeare\u2019s plays with an eye toward their historical and cultural relevance, comparing Richard III to Hitler, for example. William Logan in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0noted that \u201cAuden wrote criticism as if he had better things to do, which made its brilliance the more irritating.\u201d He characterized Auden\u2019s Shakespeare lectures as \u201crambling and sociable ... at times whimsical and perverse,\u201d and explained that Auden\u2019s criticism is informed both by psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud and S\u00f6ren Kierkegaard. Auden\u2019s more audacious observations about\u00a0Hamlet,\u00a0for example, include his belief that the title role should be played by someone dragged off the street rather than an actor, and that the plot can be compared to New York\u2019s infamous Tammany Hall political machine. Cautioning that the essays are not Auden\u2019s exact words and should not be accepted as such, Logan nevertheless concluded that \u201cthese flawed and personal lectures tell us more about Auden than his sometimes perfect verses.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAuden\u2019s career has undergone much reevaluation in recent decades. While some critics have contended that he wrote his finest work when his political sentiments were less obscured by religion and philosophy, others defend his later material as the work of a highly original and mature intellect. Many critics echo the assessment of Auden\u2019s career by the National Book Committee, which awarded him the National Medal for Literature in 1967: \u201c[Auden\u2019s poetry] has illuminated our lives and times with grace, wit and vitality. His work, branded by the moral and ideological fires of our age, breathes with eloquence, perception and intellectual power.\u201d\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
