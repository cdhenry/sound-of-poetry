Influenced by Walt Whitman, James Wright, Sylvia Plath, and Rainer Maria Rilke, McGrath writes predominantly free verse, long-lined, documentary poems deeply engaged with American popular culture and commerce. A master of the long poem, he has also written many prose poems as well as shorter lyrics.\nMcGrath has published numerous collections of poetry, including Nouns & Verbs: New and Selected Poems (2019) and Spring Comes to Chicago (1996), which won the Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award. In awarding the prize, poet Garrett Hongo labeled McGrath\u2019s unique tone \u201cironic romanticism.\u201d The centerpiece of the collection, and one of McGrath\u2019s best-known poems, is \u201cThe Bob Hope Poem,\u201d a 70-page opus modeled on Robert Pinsky\u2019s \u201cAn Explanation of America\u201d and James McMichael\u2019s \u201cFour Good Things.\u201d In a 2005 interview McGrath explained that the poem\u2019s shape \u201cis not a narrative but a symphonic structure.\u201d\nMcGrath\u2019s many other books of poetry include In the Kingdom of the Sea Monkeys (2012), Seven Notebooks (2007), Pax Atomica (2005), Florida Poems (2002), American Noise (1994), and Capitalism (1990). McGrath\u2019s poetry typically works as a kind of catalog; its long lines attempt to look at the vast complexity of America and penetrate its paradoxes and attractions. Reviewing McGrath\u2019s Seven Notebooks, writer Justin Taylor noted that \u201cMcGrath\u2019s poetry thrives on his dissatisfaction with the world \u2026 The same unquenchable passion and taste for thrill that sent the young William Vollmann to the war zones and whores of five continents sent the young McGrath all over the country, looking for America anywhere and\u2014in an important reversal of the proposition set forth by Easy Rider\u2014finding it everywhere.\u201d\nMcGrath is also the co-translator of Aristophanes\u2019s The Wasps (1999). He has won a MacArthur Foundation \u201cGenius\u201d Grant, a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Witter Bynner Fellowship from the Library of Congress, the Academy of American Poets Prize, the Cohen Award from Ploughshares literary journal, and a Pushcart Prize. His poetry has been widely anthologized, including in Great American Prose Poems (2003), The New American Poets (2000), and The New Bread Loaf Anthology of Contemporary American Poetry (1999). McGrath has taught at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University. He lives in Miami\u00a0and is a distinguished professor at Florida International University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
