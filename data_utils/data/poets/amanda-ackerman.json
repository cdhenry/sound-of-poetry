Her work blurs the lines between poetry, narrative, and prose.\u00a0Her engagement with ecopoetics is informed by her longtime work as a flower essence practitioner. In a note on the making of The Book of Feral Flora in an online conversation with Divya Victor for the Poetry Foundation, Ackerman stated, \u201cThe earth is at a tipping point, and we need the intelligence, counsel, and wisdom of other creatures. My writing process for Feral Flora attempts cross-species collaboration. It attempts to expose the co-evolutionary nature of language and acknowledges that human language has not been fashioned by humans alone, although many humans have certainly attempted to stamp out the perspectives of other creatures within the linguistic system itself.\u201d\nAckerman is the author of\u00a0The Book of Feral Flora\u00a0(2015) as well as several chapbooks, including\u00a0The Seasons Cemented\u00a0(2010),\u00a0the scented pamphlet\u00a0Air-Kissing\u00a0(2017),\u00a0I Fell in Love with a Monster Truck\u00a0(2011), and\u00a0Short Stones\u00a0(2012). With Harold Abramowitz, she coauthored the book\u00a0Man\u2019s Wars And Wickedness: A Book of Proposed Remedies\u00a0and Extreme Formulations for Curing Hostility, Rivalry, And Ill-Will\u00a0(2017), the Gauss PDF\u00a0UNFO Burns a Million Dollars\u00a0(2014),\u00a0and the\u00a0chapbook\u00a0Sin is to Celebration\u00a0(2009). With Dan Richert, she is working on a series of projects using biofeedback and multi-sensory techniques that allow plants to create poems. Their olfactory installation\u00a0Unknown Giants\u00a0(2017) was part of the Laboratory for Aesthetics and Ecology's\u00a0A New We\u00a0in Norway's Kunstall Trondheim gallery.\nIn 2006, Ackerman and Abramowitz cofounded the literary micropress eohippus labs.
