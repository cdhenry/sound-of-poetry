Her poems often reflect her preoccupation with the relationships between the common and the uncommon, advocate discipline in both art and life, and espouse restraint, modesty, and humor. She frequently used animals as a central image to emphasize themes of independence, honesty, and the integration of art and nature. Moore\u2019s work is frequently grouped with poets such as\u00a0H.D.,\u00a0T.S. Eliot,\u00a0William Carlos Williams,\u00a0Wallace Stevens,\u00a0Ezra Pound, and, later,\u00a0Elizabeth Bishop, to whom she was a friend and mentor. In his introduction to her\u00a0Selected Poems\u00a0(1935), Eliot wrote: \u201cLiving, the poet is carrying on that struggle for the maintenance of a living language, for the maintenance of its strength, its subtlety, for the preservation of quality of feeling, which must be kept up in every generation \u2026 Miss Moore is, I believe, one of those few who have done the language some service in my lifetime.\u201d\nMoore was born in 1887 near St. Louis, Missouri and grew up in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. She earned a BA in biology and histology from Bryn Mawr College; early poems such as \u201cA Jelly-Fish\u201d were first published in the college\u2019s literary magazines. After graduation, Moore studied at Carlisle Commercial College and taught at the Carlisle Indian School. Moore and her mother, who were devoted to each other, moved to New York City in 1918 and Moore began working at the New York Public Library in 1921. Her first volume\u00a0Poems\u00a0(1921) was selected and arranged by H.D., who gathered work that had appeared in journals such as\u00a0Others,\u00a0the\u00a0Egoist,\u00a0and\u00a0Poetry magazine.\u00a0Moore\u2019s second collection\u00a0Observations\u00a0(1924) included poems chosen by Moore to represent the full range of her poetry\u2019s forms and themes. The volume contained classic Moore poems such as \u201cMarriage,\u201d a long free-verse poem featuring collage-like assemblages of quotations and fragments, and \u201cAn Octopus,\u201d a detailed exploration of Mount Rainier. Named for the shape of the glacier surrounding the mountain, the poem is regarded as one of Moore\u2019s finest.\nMoore was the editor of the influential literary magazine\u00a0Dial\u00a0from 1925 to 1929, when the magazine shut down. Moore\u2019s work on the\u00a0Dial\u00a0expanded her circle of literary acquaintances and introduced her work to a more international audience. Moore published\u00a0Selected Poems\u00a0in 1935. The volume included poems from\u00a0Observations\u00a0as well as pieces that had been published between 1932 and 1934. The \u201930s and \u201940s were productive years for Moore: she published\u00a0The Pangolin and Other Verse\u00a0(1936),\u00a0What Are Years\u00a0(1941), and\u00a0Nevertheless\u00a0(1944). The last volume included Moore\u2019s anti-war poem \u201cIn Distrust of Merits,\u201d which was judged by\u00a0W.H. Auden\u00a0one of the best poems to come out of World War II. Moore, however, described the poem as \u201cjust a protest\u2014disjointed, exclamatory.\u201d Moore\u2019s comments on poetry were notoriously ambiguous\u2014her poem \u201cPoetry\u201d begins, \u201cI too dislike it\u201d\u2014and she once described herself as a \u201chappy hack.\u201d\nMoore\u2019s\u00a0Collected Poems\u00a0(1951) won both the Pulitzer Prize in poetry and the National Book Award, and in 1953 she was awarded the Bollingen Prize. Her later works include a translation of\u00a0The Fables of La Fontaine\u00a0(1954);\u00a0Like a Bulwark\u00a0(1956);\u00a0O, to Be a Dragon\u00a0(1959);\u00a0Tell Me, Tell Me: Granite, Steel, and Other Topics\u00a0(1966); and\u00a0The Complete Poems of Marianne Moore\u00a0(1967), which was reissued in 1981 with revisions to early poems and additional poems written later in life.\nMoore\u2019s\u00a0Complete Poems\u00a0generated controversy in both editions for the significant revisions to Moore\u2019s early work, including her heavy edits to the poem \u201cPoetry.\u201d Moore wrote as a note to her\u00a0Complete Poems,\u00a0\u201cOmissions are not accidents\u2014M.M.\u201d However, critics thought slashing \u201cPoetry\u201d from 31 lines to three a mistake.\u00a0Anthony Hecht\u00a0once wrote that as \u201can admiring reader I feel that I have some rights in [this] matter. Her poems are partly mine, now, and I delight in them because they exhibit a mind of great fastidiousness, a delicate and cunning moral sensibility, a tact, a decorum, a rectitude, and finally and most movingly, a capacity for pure praise that has absolutely biblical awe in it. She (and Mr. Auden, too, as it will appear) however much I may wish to take exception to the changes they have made, have provided a field day for Ph.D. candidates for years to come, who can collate versions and come up with theories about why the changes were made.\u201d\nIn addition to poetry, Moore wrote a significant number of prose pieces, including reviews and essays. Her prose works cover a broad range of subjects: painting, sculpture, literature, music, fashion, herbal medicine, and sports\u2014she was an avid baseball fan and wrote the liner notes for Muhammed Ali\u2019s record,\u00a0I Am the Greatest!\u00a0Moore\u2019s prose works include\u00a0A Marianne Moore Reader\u00a0(1961),\u00a0Predilections\u00a0(1955), and\u00a0The Complete Prose of Marianne Moore\u00a0(1987).\nMoore was highly regarded as a poet during her lifetime and even became somewhat of a celebrity, famous for her tricorn hat and cape and featured in magazines such as\u00a0Life,\u00a0the\u00a0New York Times,\u00a0and\u00a0The New Yorker.\u00a0Ford Motor Company asked her to come up with names for a new series of cars, though they rejected her suggestions. Moore\u2019s honors and awards included the Poetry Society of America's Gold Medal for Distinguished Development, the National Medal for Literature, and an honorary doctorate from Harvard University. She died in 1972 in New York City.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"], "School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
