McLane grew up in upstate New York and was educated at Harvard University, Oxford University, and the University of Chicago. She is the author of five books of poetry:\u00a0Some Say (FSG, 2017), Mz N: the serial: a poem-in-episodes (FSG, 2016), This Blue (FSG, 2014\u2014Finalist for the National Book Award in Poetry), World Enough\u00a0(FSG, 2010), and\u00a0Same Life (FSG, 2008), as well as the poetry chapbook,\u00a0This Carrying Life\u00a0(Pressed Wafer/Arrowsmith, 2006). Her book\u00a0My Poets\u00a0(FSG, 2012)\u2014an experimental hybrid of memoir and criticism\u2014was a finalist for the 2012 National Book Critics Circle Award in autobiography.\u00a0She has also published two books of literary criticism,\u00a0Balladeering, Minstrelsy, and the Making of British Romantic Poetry\u00a0(Cambridge UP, 2008) and\u00a0Romanticism and the Human Sciences\u00a0(CUP, 2000), and coedited\u00a0The Cambridge Companion to British Romantic Poetry\u00a0(CUP, 2008).\nIn 2014, the National Book Award poetry jury described McLane\u2019s This Blue as \u201can extended love song to the natural world, to the poignant fallibility of contemporary culture, and to the multifoliate possibilities of the poetic voice itself.\u201d Of McLane\u2019s work, Parul Sehgal wrote in the New York Times: \u201cShe\u2019s my favorite living poet, and \u2018Mz N: the Serial\u2019 (2016) is her best book yet. It bristles with life, feeling, argument; it\u2019s sexy and cerebral and romantic and\u2014somewhat surprisingly for a book of poetry\u2014a bit of a page-turner.\u201d UK poet and critic Sarah Howe has praised McLane\u2019s poetry for \u201cits candour and wicked\u00a0wit, its humane gaze\u00a0and unabashed complexity,\u201d while Christina Smallwood in Harper\u2019s observes: \u201cHer mix of the humorous and the cerebral is at once exuberant and rinsed with melancholy. ... Her vistas are democratic but unmonumental.\u201d\nMcLane has published widely on poetry and poetics, contemporary literature, and sexuality in the\u00a0New York Times, the Los Angeles Review of Books, the\u00a0Chicago Tribune,\u00a0Boston Review, the\u00a0Washington Post,\u00a0American Poet, and elsewhere. In 2003 she won the National Book Critics Circle\u2019s Nona Balakian Award for Excellence in Book Reviewing.\u00a0 Professor of English at NYU, she has taught at Harvard, the University of Chicago, MIT, and the East Harlem Poetry Project.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
