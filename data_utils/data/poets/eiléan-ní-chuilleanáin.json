In a 2009 interview for Wake Forest University Press, N\u00ed Chuillean\u00e1in states, \u201cThe question I ask myself constantly is \u2018is this real? Do I really believe this, do I really feel this?\u2019 But that is a question I cannot answer except by trying again in a poem.\u201d Awarding N\u00ed Chuillean\u00e1in the 2010 Griffin Prize, the judges noted, \"She is a truly imaginative poet, whose imagination is authoritative and transformative. She leads us into altered or emptied landscapes. \u2026 Each poem is a world complete, and often they move between worlds, as in the beautiful \u2018A Bridge between Two Counties.\u2019\u00a0 These are potent poems, with dense, captivating sound and a certain magic that proves not only to be believable but necessary, in fact, to our understanding of the world around us.\"\nN\u00ed Chuillean\u00e1in is the author of numerous poetry collections, including The Mother House (2020);\u00a0The Boys of Bluehill (2015), which was shortlisted for the Forward Prize for Best Collection;\u00a0The Sun-fish (2010), which won the International Griffin Poetry Prize;\u00a0Selected Poems (2009);\u00a0The Magdalene Sermon (1989), which was selected as one of the three best poetry volumes of the year by the Irish Times/Aer Lingus Poetry Book Prize Committee; and Acts and Monuments (1966), which won the Patrick Kavanagh Award.
