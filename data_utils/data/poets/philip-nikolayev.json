He grew up speaking both English and Russian and immigrated to the United States in 1990. Nikolayev earned a BA and an MA at Harvard University and a PhD at Boston University. His poetry collections include Dusk Raga (1998),\u00a0Monkey Time (2003), which won a Verse prize, and Letters from Aldenderry (2006). \u00a0 In his poems, Nikolayev pairs philosophical questions with daily life, frequently combining formal and experimental approaches. In an interview with Jack Alun for The Argotist Online, Nikolayev stated, \u201cWriting is largely spontaneous for me and improvisation and self-surprise are important parts of it. ... I write in hopes that what moves or interests or surprises me may also cause a similar response in someone else\u2014the providential reader, in Mandelstam\u2019s phrase, if you will. Often I don\u2019t know exactly where a poem\u2014a certain kind of poem\u2014leads me until the very end, where with some luck everything just happens to click sharply into focus.\u201d  \u00a0 Nikolayev is one of the founding editors of Fulcrum, \u201can annual of poetry and aesthetics,\u201d and his work has been featured in 180 More Extraordinary Poems for Every Day (2005). He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts with his wife, the poet Katia Kapovich.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
