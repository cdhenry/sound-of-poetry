Art and music inform her poems, and she offers portraits of individuals in transit, engaging themes of class and social change with wry perception. Praising \u201cthe grit and blood, wit, flesh, bone, and spirit of which the poems are made\u201d in a review of Femme Du Monde, poet Janet Hamill noted, \u201cFrom the particular they move to the universal, effortlessly. From the body they dissolve into space. The world they reference is mundane. The world they reference is marvelous.\u201d \u201cI always think of myself as evoking the blues in my poetry, and the blues are never \u2018happy\u2019 even when they\u2019re ecstatic,\u201d Spears Jones explained in a 2014 interview with Rochelle Spencer for Mosaic: Literary Arts of the Diaspora. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of temporality of life. We\u2019re only here for a brief time. There is only so much we can do. People have enemies and there are difficulties. And sometimes there\u2019s great music and great sex to lighten the load.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nSpears Jones\u2019s poetry collections include Painkiller (2010), Femme du Monde (2006), The Weather That Kills (1995), and several chapbooks.
