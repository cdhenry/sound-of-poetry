He was born in New Albany, Mississippi, the first of four sons, and moved with his family to Oxford, Mississippi, at the age of five. As a young man, influenced by the work of English poets A.E. Housman and Algernon Charles Swinburne, he began writing poems that explored Romantic themes of lost love and natural beauty.  \u00a0 After a brief stint in the Canadian Royal Air Force (where it is believed he claimed the \u201cFaulkner\u201d spelling), he enrolled at the University of Mississippi for three semesters, during which time he published his first poem, \u201cL\u2019Apres-Midi d\u2019un Faune,\u201d in the New Republic. In 1924 his first book, a poetry collection entitled The Marble Faun, was published.  \u00a0 Soon thereafter, Faulkner moved to New Orleans, where he began to write the novels and stories for which he would become famous. In his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize, Faulkner spoke on the fate of the human race in the face of the coming Cold War, stating his faith in the survival of man because \u201che has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. The poet\u2019s, the writer\u2019s duty is to write about these things [...] The poet\u2019s voice need not merely be the record of man, it can be one of the props, the pillars to help him endure and prevail.\u201d \u00a0 Faulkner died of a heart attack at the age of 64. He is buried in St. Peter\u2019s Cemetery in Oxford.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"]}}
