Eliot, William Carlos Williams, or Wallace Stevens and as well respected in book review columns. He was a rarity among 20th-century authors, a poet whose books sold in the tens of thousands and who was honored in the poetry workshops and lecture halls of prestigious universities. Though not as ubiquitous as they once were, his poems and several of his short stories remain steadily in print, finding a sizable audience among general readers year after year.\n\r\nBen\u00e9t was the youngest of the three children of James Walker Ben\u00e9t, a U.S. Army officer and Frances Neill Rose Ben\u00e9t. The Ben\u00e9t household was unfailingly warm and happy and alive with the most varied intellectual activity. James W. Ben\u00e9t \u201cwas interested in everything from the Byzantine Emperors to the development of heavy ordnance,\u201d Stephen wrote in 1940, \u201cand was the finest critic of poetry I have ever known.\u201d His mother was also an avid reader and the author of occasional verse; his sister Laura, 14 years his senior, and his brother William, 12 years his senior, were both poets and authors as well.\nBen\u00e9t grew up in a series of army-base homes that introduced him to several regions of the United States: he was born in Fountain Hill, Pennsylvania, and spent his first five years in Watervliet, New York, a year in Illinois, six years in Benicia, California, and four years in Augusta, Georgia. He entered Yale at the age of 17. Encouraged by his family, he was from the beginning a precocious reader and writer of fiction and verse, immersing himself in William Makepeace Thackeray, Joseph Conrad, Rudyard Kipling, William Morris, Christina and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, G.K. Chesterton, and many others\u2014and in the traditions of American military history. Although a traumatic year at Hitchcock Military Academy in Jacinto, California, in 1910-1911, showed him that military life could be mean and brutal, Ben\u00e9t loved and applauded the principles of honor, courage, duty, and patriotism which he found embodied in his father\u2019s career. From his earliest years, Ben\u00e9t developed a taste for romantic, melodramatic, and heroic fiction and poetry, a sympathetic observer's interest in America\u2019s regional cultures, and an old-fashioned devotion to domestic and patriotic values.\n\r\nHis success as a writer came early and continued all through his life. He won his first poetry prize from St. Nicholas Magazine at 13, sold his first poem to New Republic two months before his 17th birthday, and had his first volume of poetry, Five Men and Pompey, published in 1915. He followed his brother William to Yale in September 1915 and quickly became a major contributor to the Yale Literary Magazine, a member of its editorial board in 1916, and its chairman in 1918. He also contributed to the Yale Record, the undergraduate humor magazine, and served as one of its editors in 1918. He continued to sell poetry to national magazines, publishing The Drug Shop, Or Endymion in Edmonstoun (1917). Well before he enlisted in the army in April 1918 (he finagled his way in despite his poor eyesight and was discharged three days later when the extent of his myopia was discovered), his renown as a poet had spread beyond the Yale campus. Ben\u00e9t found work with the State Department in Washington, D.C. in August 1918. His third book, Young Adventure: A Book of Poems, was published that October and in December of the same year he returned to Yale, where he earned a B.A. in 1919.\n\r\nAfter three months of working for a New York advertising agency, Ben\u00e9t returned to Yale for graduate study in English, earning an M.A. in June 1920. During the 1919-1920 school year he and Monty Woolley, a young faculty member who later became a successful actor, prepared an acting version of Christopher Marlowe\u2019s Tamburlaine the Great (1590), which was published by Yale University Press in 1919. In addition to having his poems and short stories published in national magazines, he contributed to S4N, a New Haven little magazine founded by Dudley Fitts that provided a vehicle for a number of young poets, including Ben\u00e9t, Ramon Guthrie, and Fitts himself. Ben\u00e9t was considerably less diligent in his class work than in his extracurricular writing, submitting instead of a traditional M.A. thesis, a group of poems that was published as Heavens and Earth by Holt in 1920.\n\r\nHe began his first novel in the summer of 1920 and had finished and published it by September of 1921. The Beginning of Wisdom is Ben\u00e9t\u2019s \u201cflaming youth novel,\u201d the genre of autobiographical fiction which flourished in the 1920s, of which F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s This Side of Paradise is the best-known example. Ben\u00e9t made his first trip to Paris in 1920-1921 on a Yale traveling fellowship, worked on poetry and fiction there, and met Rosemary Carr, whom he married in Chicago on November 26, 1921.\n\r\nHis already remarkable reputation as a young poet leapt forward with The Ballad of William Sycamore, published in the New Republic in 1922 and as a pamphlet in 1923. This poem is Ben\u00e9t\u2019s first thorough-going achievement with the subject matter and technique that were to produce his most significant poetry: the rendering of gracefully idealized popular or mythic American character types in craftsmanlike, broadly entertaining rhymed verse. Ben\u00e9t\u2019s genius was for intelligent, affirmative, easily accessible, somewhat sentimental American portraiture of the sort that popular fiction and the movies sometimes exploited. In The Ballad of William Sycamore, Ben\u00e9t mythicizes the pioneer-scout type (Davy Crockett, Daniel Boone, Kit Carson) whose identifying marks are readily familiar: \u201ca coonskin cap,\u201d a log cabin, \u201clong, straight squirrel-rifles,\u201d fiddle music, a powder horn, a leather shirt. Economically enough, Ben\u00e9t\u2019s poem alludes to classic elements in the schoolroom mythology of preindustrial America: the buffalo, the unfenced land, the westering wagon trains, \u201cthe Bloody Ground of Kentucky,\u201d Johnny Appleseed, the Alamo, Custer\u2019s Last Stand. Even old seafaring New England is represented in Sycamore\u2019s wife, who reminds him of \u201ca Salem clipper.\u201d The poem\u2019s force lies in the authority with which Ben\u00e9t incorporates these familiar images into the precisely rhymed, recitable stanzas of his ballad:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My father, he was a mountaineer,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His fist was a knotty hammer;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He was quick on his feet as a running deer,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And he spoke with a Yankee stammer.\nThe poem celebrates the rugged individualism of the fictional William Sycamore, who \u201ccould not live when they fenced the land.\u201d And yet it is neither angry nor critical about the movement of American history; Sycamore\u2019s passing is of the noble and necessary sort that gives modern America its sturdy roots in an honorable past.\nHis penchant for choosing images and expressive details from the ready stock of popular stereotypes assured, of course, that Ben\u00e9t\u2019s poetic achievement would eventually be questioned by critics who valued original, experimental, or esoteric styles. Ben\u00e9t\u2019s verse was conventional insofar as it worked naturally within the framework of characters and stories already familiar to his audiences, as his next big poetic success, King David, further demonstrated. A 200-line ballad in six parts, published in the Nation in 1923, King David won that magazine\u2019s annual poetry prize and was published as a pamphlet the same year. It also drew some letters protesting the poem\u2019s perceived irreverence toward the Bible. In fact, his poem does virtually nothing but retell the story of David and Bathsheba as it appears in 2 Samuel, lightly embroidered with lines from David\u2019s elegy for Saul and Jonathan and a few similes from the Song of Solomon. Ben\u00e9t\u2019s poem calls attention to the irony of the Lord\u2019s favoring David despite his committing adultery and murder and his casual repentance for those transgressions (this lack of sincerity is apparently what offended some readers); but the biblical account, in its more solemn way, also calls attention to that irony. The main impact Ben\u00e9t effected was the intellectual shock of seeing a story that is normally bathed in the halo-light of canonized scripture, presented in a cheerfully jazzy modern manner. If the story were not a familiar one, no such effect would be possible.\n\r\nAnother of Ben\u00e9t\u2019s early successes with the ballad, \u201cThe Mountain Whippoorwill\u201d (published in Century magazine, 1925), tells the heroic come-from-behind victory of an unknown youth over the reigning lords of the community\u2014or, as Ben\u00e9t\u2019s subtitle puts it, \u201cHow Hill-Billy Jim Won the Great Fiddlers\u2019 Prize\u201d away from Old Dan Wheeling, Big Tom Sargent, and Little Jimmy Weezer (big wheels, sergeants, and weasels) at the game they think is their own. The poem has a good deal in common with Ben\u00e9t\u2019s best-known short story, The Devil and Daniel Webster (published in the October 24, 1936 issue of the Saturday Evening Post and as a book in 1937), in which a folk artist sways a difficult audience by releasing the emotional and imaginative power latent in his grass-roots origins. In some respects, The Mountain Whippoorwill is a pastiche of phrases and motifs from tall-tale and dialect humor of the sort Thomas Bangs Thorpe, Mark Twain, and Joel Chandler Harris had made current generations before: \u201cEverythin\u2019s as lazy as an old houn\u2019 dog\u201d; \u201cHe could fiddle down a possum from a mile-high tree\u201d; \u201cGo down, Moses, set my people free\u201d; \u201cHell\u2019s broke loose in Georgia.\u201d Ben\u00e9t develops some symbolic intention around the idea of the whippoorwill. The whippoorwill reminds Hill-Billy Jim of his home in the Georgia mountains; he speculates whimsically that his mother may have been a whippoorwill; he calls his fiddle his little whippoorwill. His fiddling is a kind of rustic American version of the romantics\u2019 music of the Aeolian harp, voicing as it does the primal powers and meanings of nature. The idea may be stock bardic romanticism, but Ben\u00e9t\u2019s language is colloquial southern American, and the poem became one of his most popular and most-often republished.\n\nThe Ballad of William Sycamore and \u201cThe Mountain Whippoorwill\u201d almost immediately achieved status as modern American classics and appeared in a number of anthologies. But Ben\u00e9t\u2019s struggle to earn a living was not significantly eased by the prestige that accrued to them. The years between the publication of \u201cThe Mountain Whippoorwill\u201d (1925) and John Brown\u2019s Body (1928) were filled, for Ben\u00e9t, with the frantic efforts of a young man trying to support himself and his family (his daughter Stephanie Jane was born in 1924) entirely from the sale of his writing. He engaged in a patchwork of belletristic enterprises, piecing out a barely adequate income: he wrote formula short stories for magazines; he reviewed books and plays; he collaborated with John Farrar on two unsuccessful stage dramas, Nerves and That Awful Mrs. Eaton (both produced in 1924); he wrote romantic fiction for serialization.\n\r\nIn 1925, he approached the Guggenheim Foundation with a proposal for a long historical poem on the Civil War, requesting a grant of $2,500 to support himself while he researched and wrote it. The foundation awarded the grant, and he set out for Paris, where he and his family could live more cheaply while he worked on the poem which, he thought, might \u201ctake about 7 years to write & I\u2019d have to read an entire library first.\u201d\u00a0 (The Ben\u00e9ts\u2019 second child, Thomas Carr, was born in Paris in 1926.)\n\r\nSupported by his fellowship and the fees for a few magazine short stories, Ben\u00e9t actually completed his 15,000-line panorama of the Civil War in less than two years, a monumental outpouring of sustained effort that left him exhausted for months afterward. Measured by almost any standard, the result was worth the investment. John Brown\u2019s Body (1928) was the magnum opus that elevated Ben\u00e9t\u2019s status from that of a promising young poet-storyteller to that of a national hero and a prodigy of popular success unknown among American poets, surpassing even the tremendous sales of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\u2019s The Song of Hiawatha (1855) and Evangeline (1847) of the previous century. The recently organized Book-of-the-Month Club adopted it as one of its selections. In its first two years, the poem sold more than 130,000 copies. It has since gone through dozens of printings and remains a steady seller year after year.\n\r\nThe poetry reviewers immediately and understandably began to call it an epic, though Ben\u00e9t referred to it instead as his \u201ccyclorama.\u201d John Brown's Body brought to fruition the young Ben\u00e9t\u2019s admiration for heroism, his patriotic love of the United States as a vital complex of culturally distinct regions and heritages, and his talent for clear, graceful, and accessible narrative verse.\n\r\nBefore anything else, John Brown\u2019s Body is a history of the Civil War\u2014in some respects, Bruce Catton has said, the best single book ever written on the subject. Each section is based on different characters' experiences in various battles and campaigns. The poem \u201cbegins shortly before John Brown\u2019s raid upon Harper's Ferry,\u201d Ben\u00e9t noted. Its action is continuous, ending \u201cjust after the close of the war and Lincoln's assassination.\u201d Each of the poem\u2019s eight books features at least one major military event: book one\u2014Harper's Ferry; book two\u2014the firing on Fort Sumter and the first Battle of Bull Run; book three\u2014Shiloh; book four\u2014the campaigns in eastern and western Virginia; book five\u2014Antietam and the hard winter of 1862; book six\u2014the Wilderness Campaign, Grant and Sherman at Vicksburg; book seven--Gettysburg; book eight\u2014Sherman\u2019s march to the sea and the surrender at Appomattox. Included in this chronology are numerous other major public occurrences\u2014the hanging of John Brown, the election of Lincoln, the formation of the Confederate cabinet, the appointment and dismissal of various generals, the death of Stonewall Jackson, the death of Lincoln.\n\r\nUpon this historical skeleton Ben\u00e9t applied the flesh of the personal experiences of dozens of historical and fictional characters, participants in the vast conflict. For some of his material, Ben\u00e9t drew on letters and diaries of actual Civil War soldiers; for some, he studied the careers of leaders such as Lincoln, Lee, Grant, and Jackson and projected himself into their minds, giving them soliloquies such as this one for Lincoln:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We can fail and fail,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But, deep against the failure, something wars,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Something goes forward, something lights a match,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Something gets up from Sangamon County ground\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Armed with a bitten and blunted axe\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And after twenty thousand wasted strokes\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Brings the tall hemlock crashing to the ground.\nThroughout the poem, Ben\u00e9t meticulously selects and constructs his cast of characters to represent various types of Americans involved in the war. Primarily he sees a conflict between the bourgeois-Puritan New England temper and the aristocratic-romantic South. Most of his Southern characters are connected, in one way or another, with the Wingate family of Georgia, reputed descendants (through an illegitimate connection) of England's Charles II: Clay Wingate, the family scion, a dashing young cavalryman; his mother, Mary Lou Wingate, \u201cas slightly made/And as hard to break as a rapier-blade\u201d; the family\u2019s slaves, Cudjo and Aunt Bess; Spade, the self-emancipated slave; the coquette Lucy Weatherby; the slightly wild Sally Dupr\u00e9; and an assortment of young gallants who attend soir\u00e9es at Wingate Hall and ride with the Wingates in the fictional Black Horse Troop (based on the Black Horse Cavalry). Other Southern types are more briefly sketched: Luke Breckinridge, a Tennessee hillbilly, ignorant, superstitious, a hard-eyed feuder and a sure shot with his long rifle; and Sophy, a \u201cscared chambermaid in Pollet\u2019s Hotel.\u201d\n\r\nBen\u00e9t dramatizes the New England temper primarily in young Jack Ellyat of Connecticut, in the impressionistically sketched slave-trading Yankee skipper in the prelude (\u201c\u2018I get my sailing orders from the Lord.\u2019 He touched the Bible\u201d), the \u201clady\u201d abolitionists of the North, and the poeticized words of John Brown:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And if we live, we free the slave,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And if we die, we die.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But God has digged His saints a grave\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Beyond the western sky.\nBen\u00e9t includes two other Northern types: Ellyat\u2019s comrade-in-arms Bailey, a fiercely provincial, tough-talking Illinoisian, and Jake Diefer of Pennsylvania, a stolid German peasant who goes to war, loses an arm, and comes home to his farm again. The border states and the American west, according to Ben\u00e9t\u2019s foreword, are represented in the poem by John Vilas, a romantic individualist, wanderer, and noncombatant, whose daughter marries Jack Ellyat at the end of the poem.\n\r\nBen\u00e9t\u2019s view of the war is basically a nationalistic, broadly tolerant and conciliatory one. There are no major villains in his story; the Confederates and Unionists depicted in any detail are treated with respect and sympathy, their motives seen as decent ones. In pursuit of his objective, Ben\u00e9t frankly exploits the popular romantic auras surrounding Lincoln, Lee, Grant, the antebellum South, the stern and sturdy New England Puritans, the great American war. \nBen\u00e9t\u2019s father died in 1927, just as Ben\u00e9t was finishing work on John Brown\u2019s Body. His admiration for the kind of steady martial strength he associated with his father permeates Ben\u00e9t\u2019s great poem, as in this description of Grant:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You see him standing,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reading a map, unperturbed, under heavy fire.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You do not cheer him as the recruits might cheer\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But you say \u201cUlysses doesn't scare worth a darn.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ulysses is all right.

True to Ben\u00e9t\u2019s vision of the poem as a transregional statement of American sentiments, it found admirers in every section of the country, who sent Ben\u00e9t fan letters by the thousands.\n\r\nDespite the poem\u2019s unprecedented popular success, Ben\u00e9t\u2019s struggles to support his family on the proceeds of his writing did not end (he lost a good deal of money in the stock market crash of 1929), really, until the end of his life. The Ben\u00e9ts\u2019\u00a0third child, Rachel Felicity, was born in 1931. All during his career, he continued to write short stories aimed calculatingly at popular magazines such as the Saturday Evening Post, Country Gentleman, and Good Housekeeping. He did a stint of screenwriting in Hollywood for three months in 1929-1930, turning out the script of Abraham Lincoln for D.W. Griffith. He hated the Hollywood system of writing by committee.\n\r\nIn 1930, Ben\u00e9t suffered the first debilitating attacks of arthritis of the spine, an ailment which, with its complications, rendered most of the final 13 years of his life a time of great physical discomfort. At the same time, the United States was entering the depths of the Great Depression; Ben\u00e9t, living in New York City, witnessed poverty and demoralization on every level of society. His first reaction was bitter disillusionment with two-party politics, evidenced by his announcement that he voted for the Socialist Norman Thomas in 1932. Within a very few years, though, he had come to admire Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal programs and became one of Roosevelt\u2019s staunchest defenders among the New York intelligentsia.\n\r\nThe combined traumas of his own physical and financial difficulties, the collapse of the American economy and its counterparts in the rest of the world, and the rise of fascism in Europe and such quasi-fascist stirrings in the United States as the emergence of Father Charles Coughlin and Huey Long, elicited from Ben\u00e9t a series of angry, sometimes apocalyptic vision or nightmare poems, most appearing in 1935 and 1936, and many, including \u201cNightmare, with Angels,\u201d \u201cLitany for Dictatorships,\u201d \u201cOde to the Austrian Socialists,\u201d and \u201c1936,\u201d were collected in Burning City (1936). \u201cNightmare for Future Reference\u201d and \u201cNightmare at Noon,\u201d written in 1940, likewise cover a range of large-scale disasters, some political, some technological, some moral. \u201cLitany for Dictatorships\u201d\u00a0chants a roll of the victims of political oppression; \u201cOde to the Austrian Socialists\u201d recounts, impressionistically, the massacre of socialist communitarians in 1934. \u201cMetropolitan Nightmare\u201d is a futuristic story of a change of weather that brings tropical heat and a newly evolved steel-eating termite to New York. \u201cNightmare Number Three\u201d describes the revolt of machines against their human masters. The poem \u201c1936\u201d envisions an army of skeletons marching into a war that Ben\u00e9t believed was imminent. \u201cNightmare for Future Reference\u201d envisions a third world war, during which the whole human race gradually finds itself sterile. \u201cNightmare at Noon\u201d (1940) is the monologue of a nervous American, trying to reassure himself that the war in Europe will not engulf the United States as well. \u201cNightmare, with Angels\u201d catalogues a number of theories about how, if just this or that little flaw were corrected, humanity could achieve Utopia, then ends with the appearance of a sinister angel, \u201chis mask ... the blank mask of Ares, snouted for gas-masks,\u201d who says:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You will not be saved By General Motors or the prefabricated house.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You will not be saved by dialectic materialism or the Lambeth conference.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You will not be saved by Vitamin D or the expanding universe.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, you will not be saved.\nYet it was also during this period that Ben\u00e9t collaborated with his wife Rosemary on A Book of Americans (1933), a series of lighthearted and affirmative poems for children about such figures from the past as Thomas Jefferson, Daniel Boone, Cotton Mather, and John James Audubon. And it was during this period, too, that his short-story writing culminated in the tales for which he is now remembered\u2014The Devil and Daniel Webster (1937), Johnny Pye & the Fool-Killer (1938), \u201cBy the Waters of Babylon\u201d (collected in Thirteen O'Clock, 1937).\n\r\nEminent among American men of letters, Ben\u00e9t branched out into a number of areas. In 1933 he accepted the editorship of the Yale Series of Younger Poets, a demanding job which he took very seriously, reading, analyzing, and commenting on dozens of book-length manuscripts each year. He lectured widely and appeared at writers\u2019 conferences, wrote book reviews for the New York Herald Tribune and the Saturday Review of Literature, was active in both the National Institute of Arts and Letters (to which he had been elected in 1929) and the American Academy of Arts and Letters (to which he was elected in 1938). Perhaps no one since William Dean Howells had occupied so central and influential a position in the industry of American letters as Ben\u00e9t did during the 1930s.\n\r\nWith the outbreak of WWII in Europe, Ben\u00e9t threw himself unsparingly into the enterprise of building American national morale, devoting himself increasingly to what he frankly called propaganda for the Allied cause. He worked for the Council for Democracy, wrote speeches, radio scripts, America (1944, a 40,000-word history of the United States for worldwide distribution), and much else in similar veins. In 1942 President Roosevelt read his poem \u201cPrayer\u201d at the United Nations.\n\r\nAll during these years Ben\u00e9t drove himself brutally, and his fragile health gave way. He was first hospitalized for several weeks in 1939 with nervous exhaustion. Four years later, on March 13, 1943, he suffered a heart attack and died in his wife\u2019s arms.\n\nWestern Star (1943), book one of a projected nine-book narrative poem about the settlement of America upon which Ben\u00e9t had begun work in 1928, was published soon after his death and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1944. The completed portion of Western Star is some 5,000 lines long, mostly unrhymed verse in five-and six-beat lines, with occasional departures into rhyme, often ballad forms. It tells the story of the first English settlements in Virginia and New England.\n\r\nBen\u00e9t\u2019s historiographical approach to the westering movement in Western Star is essentially the same as it was to the Civil War in John Brown\u2019s Body he tells the interwoven stories of real and representative fictional characters, drawing back from time to time to discuss the significance of the events in the voice of a modern commentator. Lacking the sensational popular appeal of legendary heroes such as Lincoln, Lee, and John Brown, and the celebrated names and places of the Civil War, Western Star has never had the popular impact of Ben\u00e9t\u2019s earlier opus. The verse throughout is more modest and sedate, its emotional objectives less pronounced and melodramatic than in the Civil War poem.\n\r\nThe measure of his achievement, however, is indisputably John Brown\u2019s Body, a poem whose na\u00eevet\u00e9 and conventionality in themes, techniques and viewpoints are raised, by the greatness of its subject and Ben\u00e9t\u2019s devoted craftsmanship, to the level of high folk art. In trying to weigh the ultimate value of this work, one is tempted to compare Ben\u00e9t to Longfellow: both wrote graceful narrative and lyric verse that treated popular historical subjects and expounded solid, safe moral and social values. Both were highly praised and embraced by general readers and literary establishments alike, and both fell from favor with literary tastemakers in the generations that followed their deaths. Ben\u00e9t, perhaps, has most in common with writers such as Carl Sandburg, Vachel Lindsay, and Edgar Lee Masters\u2014poets of considerable force and vitality whose verse drew from American lore and history a stock of ideas, feelings, and images that occasionally excited popular audiences to a degree that subtler, more fastidious poets can only dream of doing.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"], "School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
