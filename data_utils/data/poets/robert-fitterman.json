He often builds poems through appropriating and recontextualizing found text, ranging from photo captions in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (Holocaust Museum, 2013) to expressions of loneliness posted on online message boards (No, Wait. Yep. Definitely Still Hate Myself., 2014). In nearly all of Fitterman's writing, he explores the possibility of a new lyric form by composing with found language to construct a chorus; often using found language that articulates a personal, subjective relationship to social themes. His books tend to be single book-length poems with broad critiques of cultural institutions and constructs such as Facebook, online chat forums, museums, eBay, and Yelp. With the poet\u00a0Vanessa Place, Fitterman co-authored\u00a0Notes On Conceptualisms\u00a0(Ugly Duckling Presse, 2009), a prose exploration of conceptual writing. In 2008, he founded and continues to organize the artist collective, Collective Task.\nFitterman lives in New York City, where he teaches writing and poetry at New York University and at the Bard College's Milton Avery School of Graduate Studies.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
