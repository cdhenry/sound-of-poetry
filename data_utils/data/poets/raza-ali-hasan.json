My aim is to draw a more accurate, full picture of the world. In order to have the whole picture, you need to bring the whole world in.\u201d In a 2009 In Stereo Press review of 67 mogul miniatures, critic Daniel Dissinger observed, \u201cWith his use of violent imagery, mixed with sheer poetic artistry, Raza Ali Hasan constructs a sprawling world that fits in the palm of your hand.\u201d Hasan\u2019s poetry addresses political and cultural themes with imagery both sharply focused and set within a moving, unstable field.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nHasan\u2019s poetry collections include Grieving Shias (2006) and 67 mogul miniatures (2008), which loosely adapt traditional Urdu poet Mohammad Iqbal\u2019s formal structure of musaddas, sets of three rhyming couplets containing a complaint addressed to God, followed by God\u2019s reply.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHasan lives in Boulder and has taught at the University of Colorado and Iowa State University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
