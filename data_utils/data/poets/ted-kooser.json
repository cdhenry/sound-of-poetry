Poet and critic Brad Leithauser wrote in the New York Times Book Review that, \u201cWhether or not he originally set out to\u2026[Kooser\u2019s] become, perforce, an elegist.\u201d Populated by farmers, family ancestors, and heirlooms, Kooser\u2019s poems reflect his abiding interest in the past while offering clear-eyed appraisal of its hardships. While Kooser\u2019s work often treats themes like love, family and the passage of time, Leithauser noted that \u201cKooser\u2019s poetry is rare for its sense of being so firmly and enduringly rooted in one locale.\u201d His collections of poetry include Delights and Shadows (2004), Flying at Night: Poems 1965-1985 (2005), Splitting an Order (2016), and Kindest Regards: New and Selected Poems (2018). In partnership with the Poetry Foundation, Kooser founded \u201cAmerican Life in Poetry,\u201d which offers a free weekly poem to newspapers across the United States. The aim of the program is to raise the visibility of poetry. Kooser\u2019s other publications, including The Poetry Home Repair Manual: Practical Advice for Beginning Poets (2005) and Writing Brave and Free (2006), offer help to aspiring poets and writers, both in the guise of practical writing tips and essays on poetry, poets, and craft. Commenting on his writing, Kooser has said, \u201cI write for other people with the hope that I can help them to see the wonderful things within their everyday experiences. In short, I want to show people how interesting the ordinary world can be if you pay attention.\u201d\n\r\nThough Kooser does not consider himself a regional poet, his work often takes place in a recognizably Midwestern setting; when Kooser was named US poet laureate in 2004, he was described by the librarian of Congress as \u201c\u2018the first poet laureate chosen from the Great Plains.\u201d However, David Mason in the Prairie Schooner saw Kooser\u2019s work as more than merely regional. Kooser, Mason wrote, \u201chas mostly made short poems about perception itself, the signs of human habitation, the uncertainty of human knowledge and accomplishment.\u201d In his book Can Poetry Matter, the critic Dana Gioia described Kooser as a \u201cpopular poet\u201d\u2014not one who sells millions of books, but \u201cpopular in that unlike most of his peers he writes naturally for a nonliterary public. His style is accomplished but extremely simple\u2014his diction drawn from common speech, his syntax conversational. His subjects are chosen from the everyday world of the Great Plains, and his sensibility, though more subtle and articulate, is that of the average Midwesterner. Kooser never makes an allusion that an intelligent but unbookish reader will not immediately grasp. There is to my knowledge no poet of equal stature who writes so convincingly in a manner the average American can understand and appreciate.\u201d Gioia argued that it is Kooser\u2019s interest in providing \u201csmall but genuine insights into the world of everyday experience\u201d that cut him off from the \u201cspecialized minority readership that now sustains poetry.\u201d\nThough Gioia noted that Kooser has \u201cnot received sustained attention from academic critics,\u201d he is considered by some to be among the best poets of his generation. However, Kooser\u2019s fame\u2014including a Pulitzer Prize for Poetry\u2014came late in his career. Kooser began writing in his late teens and took a position teaching high school after graduating from Iowa State University in 1962. He enrolled in the graduate writing program at the University of Nebraska but essentially flunked out a year later. Realizing that he had to make a living, Kooser took an entry-level job with an insurance company in Nebraska. He would remain in the industry until 1999, eventually becoming a vice-president of Lincoln Benefit Life Company. Throughout his insurance career, Kooser wrote poems, usually from about five-thirty to seven o\u2019clock each morning before he went to the office. Kooser has wryly noted that, though both he and Wallace Stevens spent their working lives as insurance executives, Stevens had far more time to write on the job.\nKooser\u2019s early work attends to the subjects that continue to shape his career: the trials and troubles of inhabitants of the Midwest, heirlooms and objects of the past, and observation of everyday life. Kooser\u2019s first new and selected, Sure Signs (1980) was critically praised. The Black Warrior Book Review maintained it \u201ccould well become a classic precisely because so many of the poems are not only excellent but are readily possessible.\u201d In Blizzard Voices (1986), Kooser records the devastation of the \u201cChildren\u2019s Blizzard\u201d of 1888, using documents written at the time as well as reminisces recorded later. The Omaha World-Herald called it a \u201creader\u2019s theater \u2026 short but powerful.\u201d The well-observed truths of Kooser\u2019s next book, Weather Central (1994), led Booklist critic Ray Olson to note that \u201cthe scenes and actions in [Kooser\u2019s] poetry (especially the way that, in several poems, light\u2014the quintessential physical reality on the plains\u2014is a virtually corporeal actor) will seem, to paraphrase Pope, things often seen but ne\u2019er so well observed.\u201d In the late 1990s, Kooser developed cancer and gave up both his insurance job and writing. When he began to write again, it was to paste daily poems on postcards he sent in correspondence with his friend and fellow writer Jim Harrison. The result was the collection of poems called Winter Morning Walks: 100 Postcards to Jim Harrison (2001). In poems both both playful and serious, Kooser avoids talking directly about his illness. Rather, he refers to disease and the possibility of dying in metaphors focusing on the countryside around his Nebraska home, where he took long walks for inspiration. Kooser\u2019s gift for simile and metaphor is notable: \u201cKooser is one of the best makers of metaphor alive in the country, and for this alone he deserves honor,\u201d wrote Mason in a review of Winter Morning Walks for Prairie Schooner.\nKooser\u2019s essay collections include Local Wonders: Seasons in the Bohemian Alps (2002) and Lights on a Ground of Darkness (2009). Both volumes meditate on place and family. The essays in Local Wonders cover one year, or four seasons, in the author\u2019s life. Although Kooser reflects on his younger days, the essays focus largely on the details of his current life and surroundings. In a contribution to Writer, Kate Flaherty said, \u201cKooser\u2019s meditations on life in southeastern Nebraska are as meticulous and exquisite as his many collections of poetry, and his quiet reticence and dry humor are refreshing in this age of spill-it-all memoirs.\u201d Lights on a Ground of Darkness focuses on Kooser\u2019s family, especially his Uncle Elvy. David Ulin of the Los Angeles Times described the book as \u201cwritten in a prose as spare as a winter sunset,\u201d adding that \u201cit is an elegy, not just for Kooser\u2019s forebears but for all of us.\u201d\nFor Braided Creek: A Conversation in Poetry (2003) Kooser again teamed up with Harrison to publish their correspondence consisting of entirely short poems written to each other while Kooser was recovering from cancer. Writing in Poetry, contributor Ray Olson noted that \u201cwit and wisdom\u201d are the mainstay of these correspondences. Olson added, \u201cTheir conversation always repays eavesdropping.\u201d Kooser\u2019s next book, Delights and Shadows (2004) went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. In the Washington Post poet and critic Ed Hirsch noted that \u201cthere is a sense of quiet amazement at the core of all Kooser\u2019s work, but it especially seems to animate his new collection of poems.\u201d Describing the work as \u201ca book of portraits and landscapes \u2026 small wonders and hard dualisms,\u201d Hirsch compared Kooser\u2019s art to other Great Plains\u2019 poets who write \u201can unadorned, pragmatic, quintessentially American poetry of empty places, of farmland and low-slung cities,\u201d crafting poems of \u201csturdy forthrightness with hidden depths.\u201d\nWhen Kooser was named America\u2019s national poet laureate in 2004, the honor coincided with the publication of Flying at Night: Poems 1965-1985 (2005), a collection of his previously published poetry. At the time, the self-effacing poet was by no means a household name. However, Kooser used his post as laureate to further the cause of poetry with a general reading audience, founding \u201cAmerican Life in Poetry,\u201d and writing the critically acclaimed Poetry Home Repair Manual. Kooser\u2019s most recent collections include Splitting and Order and Kindest Regards: New and Selected Poems, which James Crew reviewed in the North American Review. Crews noted that \u201cthese poems train us to pay attention to what we might be tempted to ignore in pursuit of the louder and more colorful entertainments now available to us at the touch of a screen. Yet even the briefest moments that Kooser preserves can lead us more deeply into our own lives.\u201d\nKooser teaches poetry and nonfiction at the University of Nebraska, and continues to write. \u201cI waste very little time anymore,\u201d he said an interview for the University of Nebraska English Department newsletter. In addition to the Pulitzer Prize, his many honors and awards include the Nebraska Book Award, a Pushcart Prize, the Stanley Kunitz Prize, a Merit Award from the Nebraska Arts Council and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
