In his youth, he worked many odd jobs before serving in the 6th Illinois Infantry in Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War. He studied at Lombard College, and then moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he worked as an organizer for the Socialist Democratic Party. In 1913, he moved to Chicago, Illinois and wrote for the Chicago Daily News. His first poems were published by Harriet Monroe in Poetry magazine. Sandburg\u2019s collection Chicago Poems (1916) was highly regarded, and he received the Pulitzer Prize for Corn Huskers (1918). His many subsequent books of poetry include The People, Yes\u00a0(1936), Good Morning, America\u00a0(1928), Slabs of the Sunburnt West\u00a0(1922), and Smoke and Steel\u00a0(1920).\n\u201cTrying to write briefly about Carl Sandburg,\u201d said a friend of the poet, \u201cis like trying to picture the Grand Canyon in one black and white snapshot.\u201d His range of interests was enumerated by his close friend, Harry Golden, who, in his study of the poet, called Sandburg \u201cthe one American writer who distinguished himself in five fields\u2014poetry, history, biography, fiction, and music.\u201d\nSandburg composed his poetry primarily in free verse. Concerning rhyme versus non-rhyme Sandburg once said airily, \u201cIf it jells into free verse, all right. If it jells into rhyme, all right.\u201d Some critics noted that the illusion of poetry in his works was based more on the arrangement of the lines than on the lines themselves. Sandburg, aware of the criticism, wrote in the preface to Complete Poems (1950), \u201cThere is a formal poetry only in form, all dressed up and nowhere to go. The number of syllables, the designated and required stresses of accent, the rhymes if wanted\u2014they all come off with the skill of a solved crossword puzzle. ... The fact is ironic. A proficient and sometimes exquisite performer in rhymed verse goes out of his way to register the point that the more rhyme there is in poetry the more danger of its tricking the writer into something other than the urge in the beginning.\u201d He dismissed modern poetry, however, as \u201ca series of ear wigglings.\u201d In Good Morning, America\u00a0(1928), he published 38 definitions of poetry, among them: \u201cPoetry is a pack-sack of invisible keepsakes. Poetry is a sky dark with a wild-duck migration. Poetry is the opening and closing of a door, leaving those who look through to guess about what is seen during a moment.\u201d His success as a poet was limited to that of a follower of Walt Whitman and of the Imagists. In Carl Sandburg, Karl Detzer says that in 1918 \u201cadmirers proclaimed him a latter-day Walt Whitman; objectors cried that their six-year-old daughters could write better poetry.\u201d\nAdmirers of his poetry, however, have included Sherwood Anderson (\u201camong all the poets of America he is my poet\u201d), and Amy Lowell, who called Chicago Poems (1916) \u201cone of the most original books this age has produced.\u201d Lowell\u2019s observations were reiterated by H.L. Mencken, who called Sandburg \u201ca true original, his own man.\u201d No one, it is agreed, can deny the unique quality of his style. In his newspaper days, an old friend recalls, the slogan was, \u201cPrint Sandburg as is.\u201d It was Sandburg, as Golden observes, who \u201cput America on paper,\u201d writing the American idiom, speaking to the masses, who held no terror for him. As Richard Crowder notes in Carl Sandburg, the poet \u201cHad been the first poet of modern times actually to use the language of the people as his almost total means of expression. ... Sandburg had entered into the language of the people; he was not looking at it as a scientific phenomenon or a curiosity. ... He was at home with it.\u201d Sandburg\u2019s own Whitmanesque comment was, \u201cI am the people\u2014the mob\u2014the crowd\u2014the mass. Did you know that all the work of the world is done through me?\u201d He was always read by the masses, as well as by scholars. He once observed, \u201cI\u2019ll probably die propped up in bed trying to write a poem about America.\u201d\nSandburg\u2019s account of the life of Abraham Lincoln is one of the monumental works of the century. Abraham Lincoln: The War Years (1939) alone exceeds in length the collected writings of Shakespeare by some 150,000 words. Though Sandburg did deny the story that in preparation he read everything ever published on Lincoln, he did collect and classify Lincoln material for 30 years, moving himself into a garret, storing his extra material in a barn, and for nearly 15 years writing on a cracker-box typewriter. His intent was to separate Lincoln the man from Lincoln the myth, to avoid hero-worship, to relate with graphic detail and humanness the man both he and Whitman so admired. The historian Charles A. Beard called the finished product \u201ca noble monument of American literature,\u201d written with \u201cindefatigable thoroughness.\u201d Allan Nevins saw it as \u201chomely but beautiful, learned but simple, exhaustively detailed but panoramic ... [occupying] a niche all its own, unlike any other biography or history in the language.\u201d The Pulitzer Prize committee apparently agreed. Prohibited from awarding the biography prize for any work on Washington or Lincoln, it circumvented the rules by placing the book in the category of history. As a result of this work, Sandburg was the first private citizen to deliver an address before a joint session of Congress (on February 12, 1959, the 150th anniversary of Lincoln\u2019s birth).\nPerhaps Sandburg was best known to America as the singing bard\u2014the \u201cvoice of America singing,\u201d says Golden. Sandburg was an author accepted as a personality, as was Mark Twain. Requests for his lectures began to appear as early as 1908. He was his own accompanist, and was not merely a musician of sorts; he played the guitar well enough to have been a pupil of Andres Segovia. Sandburg\u2019s songs were projected by a voice \u201cin which you [could] hear farm hands wailing and levee Negroes moaning.\u201d It was fortunate that he was willing to travel about reciting and recording his poetry, for the interpretation his voice lent to his work was unforgettable. With its deep rich cadences, dramatic pauses, and Midwestern dialect, his speech was \u201ca kind of singing.\u201d Ben Hecht once wrote: \u201cWhether he chatted at lunch or recited from the podium he had always the same voice. He spoke like a man slowly revealing something.\u201d\nSandburg was the recipient of numerous honorary degrees, had six high schools and five elementary schools named for him, and held news conferences with presidents at the White House. \u201cMy father couldn\u2019t sign his name,\u201d wrote Sandburg; \u201c[he] made his \u2018mark\u2019 on the CB&Q payroll sheet. My mother was able to read the Scriptures in her native language, but she could not write, and I wrote of Abraham Lincoln whose own mother could not read or write! I guess that somewhere along in this you\u2019ll find a story of America.\u201d\nA Sandburg archives is maintained in the Sandburg Room at the University of Illinois. Ralph G. Newman, who is known primarily as a Lincoln scholar but who also is the possessor of what is perhaps the largest and most important collection of Sandburgiana, has said that a complete bibliography of Sandburg\u2019s works, including contributions to periodicals and anthologies, forewords, introductions, and foreign editions would number more than 400 pages. Sandburg received 200\u00ad to 400 letters each week. Though, to a friend who asked how he managed to look 10 years younger than he appeared on his last visit, he replied, \u201cFrom NOT answering my correspondence,\u201d he reportedly filed his mail under \u201cF\u201d (friendly and fan letters), \u201cNo reply needed,\u201d and \u201cHi fi\u201d (to be read and answered).\nFor all this fame, he remained unassuming. What he wanted from life was \u201cto be out of jail, ... to eat regular, ... to get what I write printed, ... a little love at home and a little nice affection hither and yon over the American landscape, ... [and] to sing every day.\u201d He wrote with a pencil, a fountain pen, or a typewriter, \u201cbut I draw the line at dictating \u2019em,\u201d he said. He kept his home as it was, refusing, for example, to rearrange his vast library in some orderly fashion; he knew where everything was. Furthermore, he said, \u201cI want Emerson in every room.\u201d\nOn September 17, 1967, there was a National Memorial Service at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, at which Archibald MacLeish and Mark Van Doren read from Sandburg\u2019s poetry. A Carl Sandburg Exhibition of memorabilia was held at the Hallmark Gallery in New York City, from January to February, 1968, and his home is under consideration as a National Historical site.\nSandburg\u2019s prose and poetry continues to inspire publication in new formats. The volume Arithmetic (1993), for example, presents Sandburg\u2019s famous poem of the same title in the form of a uniquely illustrated text for children. Sandburg\u2019s poem is a humorous commentary on the grade-school experience of learning arithmetic: \u201cArithmetic is where numbers fly like pigeons in and out of your head.\u201d Reviewers praised the creative presentation of the poem, and the effectiveness of what School Library Journal reviewer JoAnn Rees called Ted Rand\u2019s \u201cbrightly colored, mixed-media anamorphic paintings.\u201d Also written for children, several of Sandburg\u2019s unpublished \u201cRootabaga\u201d stories (also referred to as \u201cAmerican fairy tales\u201d) have been posthumously collected by Sandburg scholar George Hendrick in More Rootabagas (1993). Sandburg had published Rootabaga Pigeons in 1923 and Potato Face in 1930, leaving many other tales in the series unpublished. Critics praised the inventiveness, whimsicality, and humor of the stories, which feature such characters and places as \u201cThe Potato Face Blind Man,\u201d \u201cAx Me No Questions,\u201d and \u201cThe Village of Liver and Onions.\u201d \u201cSandburg was writing for the children in himself,\u201d comments Verlyn Klinkenborg in New York Times Book Review, \u201cfor the eternal child, who, when he or she hears language spoken, hears rhythm, not sense.\u201d\nIn 2002, a collection of Sandburg\u2019s previously unknown letters, manuscripts, and photographs was auctioned for $80,000 by Tom Hall Auctions in Schneckville, Pennsylvania. The papers belonged to Sandburg\u2019s editor until her death, when they were given to her nephew. Many items were obtained by the University of Illinois, where Sandburg\u2019s papers are held.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"], "School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
