He attended Magdalen College, Oxford, and the Sorbonne. Then, for some years, he ran a fishing boat in County Galway. He restored the boat himself: a revealing enterprise, suggesting as it does that concern for the objective recovery of the Irish past which is so much a feature of his verse. His cosmopolitan, colonial Anglo-Irish background fitted him to explore his Irish inheritance from a position combining intimacy with a measure of detachment: an astute stance which makes itself evident both in his manner and in his subject-matter. Murphy was the author of many books of poetry over his life.\nAs a lyric poet, Murphy\u2019s gift is for quiet, precise, musical phrasing but this is not his only talent. He is equally notable\u2014indeed unusual\u2014for his skill in narrative poems, as in \u201cSailing to an Island\u201d or \u201cThe Woman of the House,\u201d which, though it describes itself as an elegy for his grandmother, Lucy May Ormsby, is predominantly a narrative created from memory, and one which vividly succeeds in evoking the lost world of the Ascendancy. Such poems are often written in a rhythmic, four-stress, accentual meter, with some alliteration and the use of half-rhyme: they seem, appropriately enough, indebted both to Saxon and Gaelic models. In The Battle of Aughrim (1968), Murphy examines the consequences of one of the most decisive events in Irish history. \u201cAughrim\u2019s dread disaster\u201d (1691) was the final defeat for the Catholic forces arrayed against the Williamites. It was followed by the Treaty of Limerick, and the penal period. Murphy\u2019s series was broadcast in 1968, with Ted Hughes and Cecil Day Lewis among the readers. It sought to trace some of the roots of present troubles: \u201cNames in the rival churches are written on plaques.\u201d But Murphy\u2019s forebears, he seems guiltily aware, are implicated in some of the wrongs committed since then.\nMurphy died in early 2018 at his home in Sri Lanka.\n\nPOETRY\nThe Archaeology of Love.
