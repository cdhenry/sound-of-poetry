Ali\u2019s poems, both lyric and musical, explore the intersection of faith and daily life. In a review of The Fortieth Day, Library Journal noted that Ali \u201ccontinues his task of creating a rejuvenated language that longs to be liberated from the weight of daily routine and the power of dogmatic usage ... writing in the tradition of Wallace Stevens, Ali is clearly a poet of ideas and symbols, yet his words remain living entities within the texture of the poem.\u201d\nHis prose includes The Disappearance of Seth (2009), Bright Felon: Autobiography and Cities (2009), Resident Alien: On Border-crossing and the Undocumented Divine (2015), Ana\u00efs Nin: An Unprofessional Study (Agape Editions, 2017), Silver Road: Essays, Maps & Calligraphies (2018), and Northern Light: Power, Land, and the Memory of Water (Milkweed Editions, forthcoming 2021).\u00a0He is also the author of the novel Quinn\u2019s Passage (2005), which was named one of the Best Books of 2005 by Chronogram magazine, and the experimental novel, written as a musical score, The Secret Room: A String Quartet (Kaya Press, 2017). He has translated Marguerite Duras\u2019s Abahn Sabana David (2017) and When the Night Agrees to Speak to Me (2017) by Ananda Devi.\nIn 2003 Ali co-founded Nightboat Books and served as the press\u2019s publisher until 2007.
