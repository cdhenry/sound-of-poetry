Shortly after the Vietnam War, Chuc, her mother, and her brother were granted political asylum and settled in Pasadena, California. Her father remained in a Vietnamese \u201creeducation camp\u201d for nine years. Chuc earned a BA in philosophy and credentials in primary and secondary education as well as an MFA in creative writing from Goddard College. She is the author of three collections of poetry: Red Thread (2012), Keeper of the Winds (2014), and Invisible Light (2018). Her many chapbooks include Truth is Black Rubber (2010), Year of the Hare (2013), and How One Loses Notes and Sounds (2016). Chuc\u2019s poetry engages memory, trauma, healing, and her family\u2019s particular history of the Vietnam War. In an interview with Rattle magazine, Chuc said of the poems in Red Thread, \u201cI felt an almost urgent need to document my family\u2019s experiences for them and for my children. \u2026 I felt that there was this big story about war and humanity and my family was part of it, not by choice but by chance.\u201d\nChuc is a fellow of and teacher consultant for the Los Angeles Writing Project and teaches writing and literature at a public high school. She is founder and editor in chief of Shabda Press and a member of the Coast to Coast Poetry Press Collective.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Asia, Southeast"]}}
