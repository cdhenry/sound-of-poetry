His numerous poetry collections include Song for Someone Going Away and Other Poems (1971), Good News (1994), and Selected Early Poems 1958\u20131983 (2010). His poetry has been featured on Garrison Keillor\u2019s syndicated National Public Radio program, The Writer\u2019s Almanac. Kuzma is also the author of the essay collections What Poetry Is All About (1998) and A Book of Rereadings: Two (2008). An editor of Best Cellar Press, Kuzma has spoken about reading in the context of his experience as editor of a small press: \u201cI am not even sure I believe in such a thing as good poetry.\u2026 There has not been a single poet, no matter how various my initial impressions, that has not brought something in me alive, to life, or sustained life.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nKuzma is professor emeritus at the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln. In addition to serving as the editor of Best Cellar Press, he has edited the literary magazine Pebble. He lives in Crete, Nebraska.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
