His debut collection, Red Summer (2006), examines the infamous race riots of 1919, during which nearly a hundred African American men in cities across the country were lynched. The book won the 2004 Dorset Prize from Tupelo Press. Selecting the volume, judge Carl Phillips noted that \u201cJohnson\u2019s poems remind us that the human record is at last a mixed one: violence, shame, betrayal, and fear, but also joy, courage, love and, yes, hope. Red Summer gives us the stirring debut of a restorative new American voice.\u201d  \u00a0 Influenced by Amiri Baraka, Audre Lorde, and Robert Hayden, Johnson\u2019s poems combine narrative and lyric to explore the roots of violence and desire. In conversation with poet Douglas Kearney for the Boxcar Poetry Review, Johnson discussed the connection between his poetry and his prior work as an archivist. \u201cI fell in love with things like receipts or shopping lists,\u201d Johnson acknowledged. \u201cIt was ephemeral, but I think our lives, our personal histories are made up of the accumulation of junk. When I write I\u2019m trying to bring those things to the surface.\u2026 I guess that makes my work restorative.\u201d \u00a0 Johnson is a graduate of the Cave Canem workshop and a former Stegner Fellow in Poetry at Stanford University. He has received scholarships from the Hurston/Wright Foundation and the Bread Loaf Writers\u2019 Conference. \u00a0 Johnson teaches at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
