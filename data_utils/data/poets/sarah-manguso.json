Her books include the poetry collections Siste Viator (2006) and The Captain Lands in Paradise (2002) and\u00a0the story collection Hard to Admit and Harder to Escape (2007).\u00a0Her work has been featured in several volumes of The Best American Poetry.\nManguso\u2019s\u00a0nonfiction book 300 Arguments (2017) was named a best book of the year by over 20 publications.\u00a0Her other nonfiction books include Ongoingness: The End of a Diary (2015), The Guardians (2012), and The Two Kinds of Decay (2008), which was selected as an Editors\u2019 Choice by the New York Times Sunday Book Review.\nPrecise and boldly imagined, Manguso\u2019s work is frequently a kind of unflinching self-portraiture created through lyric gestures. In an interview with SMITH Magazine, Manguso stated, \u201cI am interested in deep alertness, and I think it\u2019s possible to be deeply alert to moments that are already over.\u201d In a Bookforum review of The Guardians, Jenny Davidson noted, \u201cIn the case of some other book, it might be a criticism to observe that the author\u2019s private language has only been partially translated into a meaningful idiom, but here it represents the book\u2019s most distinctive stylistic achievement: Manguso\u2019s embrace of rhetorical failure itself constitutes an unusual and strangely affecting lament.\u201d\nManguso\u2019s honors include the Rome Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a Hodder Fellowship from Princeton University, and a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. She has taught at the Pratt Institute, Columbia University, and the New School. She is a dual citizen of the United States and Ireland, and she lives in Los Angeles, where she teaches in the low-residency MFA program at Antioch University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
