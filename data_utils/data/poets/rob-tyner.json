Best known for the song \u201cKick Out the Jams,\u201d from its 1969 self-titled live debut album, MC5 had a radical, distorted sound that combined elements of blues and soul with Tyner\u2019s incendiary vocals.  \u00a0 John Sinclair\u2014poet, White Panther Party leader, and the band\u2019s manager\u2014encouraged the inclusion of revolutionary politics in MC5\u2019s song lyrics. Outside the 1968 Chicago Democratic National Convention, the group gave a free concert as part of an anti\u2013Vietnam War rally that escalated into a violent clash with police.  \u00a0 Tyner died of a heart attack at the age of 46 near his home in Berkley, Michigan. \ufeff\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
