At the age of 20 he left for Paris, where he began writing poems in earnest. He earned a BA and MA at San Diego State University, an MFA at the University of California at Irvine, and a PhD at the University of Utah.\r\n\u00a0\r\nInfluenced by writers as diverse as Roland Barthes, Wallace Stevens, and Rainer Maria Rilke, Santos writes poems that grapple with our global-historical context, as well as with the act of writing itself. Critic William Logan observed in a review of\u00a0The Perishing\u00a0(2003) for\u00a0the New Criterion, \u201cSantos has seen certain abysses and not drawn back from them.\u201d In a 2002 interview with the\u00a0Valparaiso Poetry Review, Santos himself stated, \u201cI think of my books as bracketed obsessions\u2014bracketed by time or circumstance\u2014and that writing each book was an attempt to interrogate, elaborate, and examine each obsession.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nSantos is the author of numerous poetry collections, including\u00a0Square Inch Hours (2017), which was longlisted for the National Book Award; The Intricate Soul: New and Selected Poems\u00a0(2010);\u00a0The Perishing (2003); The Pilot Star Elegies\u00a0(1999), winner of the Theodore Roethke Poetry Prize and a finalist for the National Book Award; The City of Women (1993); The Southern Reaches (1989); and\u00a0Accidental Weather\u00a0(1982), which was chosen for the National Poetry Series. His essay collection,\u00a0A Poetry of Two Minds\u00a0(2000), was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in Criticism, and his collection of translations,\u00a0Greek Lyric Poetry: A New Translation\u00a0(2005), won the Umhoefer Prize for Achievement in the Humanities.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSantos\u2019s other honors include the American Academy of Arts and Letters\u2019 Award for Literary Excellence, the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Award,\u00a0Poetry\u00a0magazine\u2019s Oscar Blumenthal Prize, the\u00a0Paris Review\u2019s B.F. Connors Long Poem Prize, the Poetry Society of America\u2019s Lyric Poetry Prize, a \u201cDiscovery\u201d/The Nation\u00a0award, and Pushcart Prizes in both poetry and the essay. He has been poet-in-residence at the Frost House in New Hampshire and the Poets\u2019 House in Portmuck, Northern Ireland. He has also been awarded fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the Ingram Merrill Foundation.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSantos teaches\u00a0at the University of Missouri, Columbia, where he received the Gold Chalk Teaching Award.\n", "attrs": {}}
