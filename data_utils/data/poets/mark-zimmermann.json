His book, recently nominated for a Pushcart Prize, is comprised of first-person poems narrated by a varied cast of literary characters, historical figures, and authors, such as Sir John Falstaff, Grigory Rasputin, Lady Diana, Emily Dickinson, and Lady Gaga. All poems in the book are written in a form, the lipogram, in which letters of the alphabet are deliberately excluded from a work. Critic Lewis Turco has said of\u00a0Impersonations: \u201cI wish I\u2019d had Mark Zimmermann\u2019s poems when I was putting together the last edition of\u00a0The Book of Forms\u2014I would certainly have used one and included the form. Zimmermann has wit, a great deal of talent as a writer, a fine ear for the language, and the discipline that a poet needs to go with these ingredients.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nZimmermann\u2019s poetry has also been published in\u00a0New Letters,\u00a0Cream City Review,\u00a0Verse Wisconsin,\u00a0New Verse News,\u00a0Wisconsin Review,\u00a0The Writer,\u00a0Vocabula Review, and elsewhere. His prose has appeared in\u00a0The Asahi Evening News, International Herald Tribune Asahi, The Daily Yomiuri, The Budapest Sun, Vocabula Review, Verse Wisconsin,\u00a0and other publications.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nZimmermann earned his BA and MA from University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Since 2004, he has taught writing and humanities courses at the Milwaukee School of Engineering, and he was awarded the Johnson Controls Award for Teaching Excellence in 2013. He taught at Ibaraki University in Mito, Japan, from 1993 to 2001. He serves on the Wisconsin Poet Laureate Commission and is a member of the Hartford Avenue Poets. He lives in Milwaukee with his wife Carole.\n", "attrs": {}}
