Born in Aberdare, Wales, he developed an early interest in English poetry. After the outbreak of the war, he joined the British Army Royal Engineers; during that time, he published a poetry collection and a collection of short stories. In 1944, he died in Burma from a self-inflicted wound.\nLewis published the poetry collection Raiders\u2019 Dawn (1942) and the short story collections The Last Inspection (1942), and Ha! Ha! Among the Trumpets (1945). Following the posthumous collections of several works, including Letters from India (1946) and Selected Poetry and Prose (1966), Lewis has become one of the most well-known poets of World War II. Critic Ian Hamilton writes that Lewis\u2019s poetry reflects his attempts \u201cto catch and hold some vision that would illuminate its desolation with meaning.\u201d\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Wales"]}}
