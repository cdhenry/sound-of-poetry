West attended Blundell\u2019s School where he first met C.E.M. Joad, a lifelong friend who had much to do with West\u2019s posthumous reputation. Both young men won scholarships to Balliol College, Oxford. Joad was a pacifist and early objector to World War I. West enlisted in 1914 and, after being turned down initially for poor eyesight, eventually saw action in the trenches in France. Promoted for officer training, West endured the incompetence of senior army staff and, coupled with the horrors he had seen in France, gradually lost his belief in the war and religion both. West returned to active duty as Captain and was killed by a sniper near Bapaume. \u00a0 Joad edited and saw through to publication a version of West\u2019s war diary. Published as The Diary of a Dead Officer: Being the Posthumous Papers of Arthur Graeme West (1919), the book was one of the earliest to link idealistic jingoism to the slaughter in the trenches. There is evidence that Joad heavily edited West\u2019s account, which portrayed West as completely unsuited for army life. But West\u2019s book contains some of the earliest verse to portray the reality of army life, including poems such as \u201cThe Night Patrol\u201d and \u201cGod! How I hate you, you cheerful young men.\u201d\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
