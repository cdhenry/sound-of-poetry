She has long written in narrative and epic and genre-bending modes to discover new ways to explore the nature of the self and the social and cultural importance of disobedience. The artist Rudy Burckhardt once wrote that Notley may be \u201cour present-day Homer.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nNotley was born in Arizona and grew up in Needles, California. After earning her BA from Barnard College and MFA from the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, Notley traveled extensively around the U.S. and abroad. She met the poet\u00a0Ted Berrigan, and the couple lived in Southampton, New York (in the garage of painter Larry Rivers); Manhattan; Providence, Rhode Island; and Bolinas, California. The poetry community in Bolinas was particularly strong at the time, with\u00a0Joanne Kyger,\u00a0Philip Whalen,\u00a0Bill Berkson,\u00a0Robert Creeley, and Bobbie Louise Hawkins all among its residents. In 1972, Berrigan and Notley married and moved to Chicago, where they lived until 1976. She\u00a0had two sons with him, the poets Edmund and Anselm Berrigan.\n\r\nActive in the New York poetry scene of the 1960s and \u201870s, Notley is often identified with the Second Generation New York School poets, though her work resists any period classification. In an interview with the Kenyon Review, Notley noted: \u201cI think I try with my poems to create a beginning space. I always seem to be erasing and starting over, rather than picking up where I left off, even if I wind up taking up the same themes. This is probably one reason that I change form and style so much, out of a desire to find a new beginning, which is always the true beginning.\u201d\n\r\nNotley is the author of over 40 books of poetry, including 165 Meeting House Lane (1971), Phoebe Light (1973), Incidentals in the Day World (1973), For Frank O\u2019Hara\u2019s Birthday (1976), Alice Ordered Me to Be Made: Poems 1975 (1976), Dr. Williams\u2019 Heiresses (1980), How Spring Comes (1981), which received the San Francisco Poetry Award, Waltzing Matilda (1981), Margaret & Dusty (1985), From a Work in Progress (1988), Homer\u2019s Art (1990), To Say You (1993), Selected Poems of Alice Notley (1993), The Descent of Alette (1996), among many others. Mysteries of Small Houses (1998) won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and her collection Disobedience (2001) was awarded the Griffin International Poetry Prize. Notley\u2019s recent work includes From the Beginning (2004), Alma, or the Dead Women (2006), Grave of Light: New and Selected Poems 1970-2005, which received the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize, In the Pines (2007), Culture of One (2011), Songs and Stories of the Ghouls (2011), Benediction (2015), and Certain Magical Acts (2016).\n\r\nReferring back to her writing in the 1970s in an interview with the Ampersand Review, Notley says she felt she was \u201cthe only poet I knew of who used the details of pregnancy and motherhood as a direct, pervading subject in poems, on a daily basis, as if it were true that half the people in the world gave birth to others and everyone had been born.\u201d Poems from this time include\u00a0 \u201cClinical Thermometer Set with Moonstone\u201d and \u201cHow Spring Comes\u201d. \u00a0In these poems, as in much of Notley\u2019s work, details from daily life enter in fragments that can be both entertaining and jarringly serious. Notley borrows images and inspirations from popular cultural (Muhammed Ali and Marlon Brando in \u201c30th\u00a0Birthday\u201d and comic books in \u201cThe Ten Best Issues of Comic Books\u201d), as well as the more serious literary world. \u201cJack Would Speak Through the Imperfect Medium of Alice\u201d is an imagined rebuke by Beat writer Jack Kerouac of his biographers, many of whom focused on the lurid and sensational details of his personal life rather than the importance and impact of his writing.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn the spring of 1976, Notley and her family returned to New York, and her husband Ted fell ill with hepatitis, a disease he suffered from until his death in 1983. While not directly autobiographical, \u201cSonnet\u201d, written in 1976, tells the story of comedian Gracie Allen\u2019s illness and her husband\u2019s efforts to nurse her back to health. Among Notley\u2019s most famous works is \u201cAt Night the States\u201d, an elegy for Berrigan written two years after his death. The words \u201cat night the states\u201d serve as a refrain that marks the beginning of each stanza. Notley has said that her decision to place the refrain at the beginning of the stanza rather than the end is what allowed her to continue writing the poem. A fairly long poem that Notley generally reads quickly, \u201cAt Night the States\u201d gives the reader a feeling of being pulled through grief and back into life, with irregular syntax signaling the disruption to day-to-day living caused by a great loss. A similar style is found in other poems from that era, including \u201cI the People\u201d.\u00a0 In this Poem Talk podcast devoted to this poem, it is read as a sort of non-political political poem, bringing the personal into the public.\u00a0\n\r\nAfter having befriended the British poet and novelist Douglas Oliver during an earlier trip to England, Notley later reconnected with him, marrying in 1988 and moving to Paris in 1992. Notley\u2019s writing at this time begins to shift away from singular poems and toward book-length projects with overarching styles and themes. In an important essay titled \u201cThe Poetics of Disobedience\u201d, Notley says this shift began with her book The Descent of Alette (1992). She describes it as \u201can immense act of rebellion against dominant social forces, against the fragmented forms of modern poetry, against the way a poem was supposed to look according to both past and contemporary practice.\u201d The narrator, Alette, finds herself in a feminist epic, on a subway, traveling deeper and deeper in the tunnels, into an underworld filled with caves and otherworldly characters. The text is visually striking with quotation marks surrounding each poetic foot, intended to slow the reader down and indicate the pace at which the book is to be read. The same style extends to other poems from this time period, such as \u201cWhite Phosphorus\u201d.\r\n\u00a0\r\nNotley\u2019s next book, Mysteries of Small House (1998), is an experiment with the autobiographical mode, in which Notley \u201cwas firstly trying to realize the first person singular as fully and nakedly as possible.\u201d Her subsequent book, Disobedience (2001), heads in the opposite direction, showing disobedience to the notions of truth and reality, featuring comic confrontations with reoccurring characters like Robert Mitch-ham, a man that closely resembles the actor Robert Mitchum. Recent books continue to be at least somewhat character centered. Culture of One sees Notley returning to the desert of her childhood to tell the story of one of its residents.\u00a0 This \u201cnovel in poems,\u201d as its jacket copy describes it, covers the life of Marie, a woman who lives in a shack in the town dump.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWith Songs and Stories of the Ghouls (2011), Notley once again takes on the challenge of creating a feminist epic. In reframing and re-empowing Dido and Medea, she is writing a meditation on destruction. \u201cLogic\u201d sees cities destroyed as poems are stolen; a bloodied performer attempts to win over a non-existent audience in \u201cPerhaps Not for You\u201d. There is, however, some hope to be found in \u201cMillions of Us\u201d, which ends \u201cWe have this project to / change our silence into the beautiful city of a voice.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn addition to collections of poetry, Notley has published the autobiography Tell Me Again (1982), the play Anne\u2019s White Glove (1985), and a book of essays on poets and poetry, Coming After (2005). She edited and wrote the introduction for the reissue of Ted Berrigan\u2019s The Sonnets (2000), as well as editing, with her sons, The Collected Poems of Ted Berrigan (2005). Her honors and awards include an Arts and Letters Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the Shelley Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America. She has also been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. She was married the British poet Douglas Oliver until his death in 2000.\u00a0\n\r\nAlice Notley continues to live in Paris and makes frequent trips to the U.S. to give readings and lectures. Among her two newest volumes are Eurynome\u2019s Sandals (Presses Universitaires de Rouen, 2019) and For the Ride (Penguin Books, 2020). In 2015, she was awarded the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["New York School (2nd Generation)"]}}
