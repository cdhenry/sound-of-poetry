He earned a BA and an MFA from the University of Arizona. His many poetry collections include Not Go Away is My Name (2020), The Dangerous Shirt (2009), The Theater of Night (2006), Five Indiscretions (1985), and Whispering to Fool the Wind (1982), which was selected by Donald Justice for the 1981 Walt Whitman Award. R\u00edos is also the author of several short story collections, including The Curtain of Trees (1999) and The Iguana Killer: Twelve Stories of the Heart (1984), as well as the memoir Capirotada: A Nogales Memoir (1999). His honors including six Pushcart Prizes, the Arizona Governor's Arts Award, and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\u201cR\u00edos\u2019s poetry is a kind of magical storytelling, and his stories are a kind of magical poetry,\u201d commented Jos\u00e9 David Sald\u00edvar in the Dictionary of Literary Biography. R\u00edos grew up in a Spanish-speaking family but was forced to speak English in school, leading him to develop a third language, \u201cone that was all our own,\u201d as he described it. R\u00edos once commented, \u201cI have been around other languages all my life, particularly Spanish, and have too often thought of the act of translation as simply giving something two names. But it is not so, not at all. Rather than filling out, a second name for something pushes it forward, forward and backward, and gives it another life.\u201d\nSald\u00edvar wrote of R\u00edos, \u201cMany of his important early poems dramatize the essence of this uncanny third language.\u201d There are examples of these in the prize-winning collection Whispering to Fool the Wind, which contains poems that Mary Logue, writing in the Voice Literary Supplement, called \u201cwritten miracles\u201d that \u201ccarry the feel of another world.\u201d These poems, she noted, are informed by his upbringing in the border town of Nogales, Arizona, \u201cwhere one is neither in this country nor the other.\u201d\nSald\u00edvar explained that R\u00edos tells stories in verse, something that many writers have been unable to do successfully. R\u00edos, however, is able to bring to life characters such as a man who dies of anger when a seamstress refuses to give him pins with which to display his butterfly collection. \u201cThroughout Whispering to Fool the Wind magical-realist events are related with the greatest of accuracy without being forced on the reader,\u201d Sald\u00edvar wrote. \u201cIt is left up to readers to interpret things for themselves in a way that is most familiar to them.\u201d\nSald\u00edvar deemed \u201cNani,\u201d about R\u00edos\u2019s grandmother, the best poem in the collection \u201cand one of the most remarkable poems in Chicano literature.\u201d It \u201ccaptures the reality of the invented third language,\u201d he said, with lines such as \u201c\u2018To speak, now-foreign words I used to speak, too, dribble down her mouth. ... By the stove she does something with words and looks at me only with her back.\u2019\u201d Logue also praised the poet\u2019s unusual use of language, observing that \u201cR\u00edos\u2019s tongue is both foreign and familiar, but always enchanting.\u201d\nIn Five Indiscretions, \u201cmost of the poems achieve a level of excellence not far below the peak moments of [R\u00edos\u2019s] earlier poetry,\u201d Sald\u00edvar asserted. Almost all of these poems deal with romantic and sexual relationships between men and women, with the poet taking both male and female viewpoints. This collection has \u201cregrettably ... not received the acclaim and attention it deserves,\u201d Sald\u00edvar opined. \u201cThe few book reviews, however, praised his ability to represent gender issues and his use of the American language.\u201d\nR\u00edos\u2019s award-winning book of short stories, The Iguana Killer: Twelve Stories of the Heart, contains tales \u201cexplor[ing] the luminous world of his childhood and border culture,\u201d Sald\u00edvar related. The title story centers on a young Mexican boy who uses a baseball bat to become his country\u2019s leading iguana killer. \u201cThe Birthday of Mrs. Pineda\u201d is about an oppressed wife who finally gets a chance to speak for herself. This and \u201cThe Way Spaghetti Feels\u201d are, in Sald\u00edvar\u2019s estimate, \u201cthe best stories in the book\u201d; he commented that they \u201cborder on the metafictional and magical-realist impulse in postmodern fiction.\u201d\nThese characteristics also are evident in the 1995 work Pig Cookies and Other Stories, set in a small Mexican town where cookies exhibit supernatural powers and life takes other surprising twists and turns. \u201cThe tales in this collection glisten with a magical sheen, at once other-worldly and real,\u201d remarked Greg Sanchez in World Literature Today. \u201cR\u00edos takes us from the realm of imagination to the concrete and back again with surprising fluidity.\u201d R\u00edos also creates winning characters, wrote a Publishers Weekly reviewer: \u201cThese poignant, funny tales of the rich, unsuspected lives of regular folks transcend time and place.\u201d R\u00edos\u2019s The Curtain of Trees: Stories focuses on residents of small towns along the border of Arizona and Mexico. A Publishers Weekly critic stated that the \u201ccharacters are from another era (circa the 1950s), roaming the unpaved streets of small villages, their lives made vividly real through the author\u2019s powerful sensitivity and sharp eye for detail.\u201d\nCapirotada: A Nogales Memoir, \u201ca monologue that is funny, intimate, and as sweet as a candy placed in your palm by a friend,\u201d according to Booklist critic GraceAnne A. DeCandido, appeared in 1999. In Capirotada, R\u00edos describes his experiences growing up in Nogales, Arizona, which shared a border with its sister city of Nogales, Mexico. A Publishers Weekly reviewer called the work \u201can extremely personal family history filled with small anecdotes and finely drawn landscapes.\u201d In Library Journal, Gwen Gregory remarked, \u201cThis well-balanced narrative recalls the universal experiences of childhood and unique personal reminiscences of the author.\u201d\nThe Smallest Muscle in the Human Body, a 2002 collection of poems, \u201cfocuses squarely on childhood experiences and memories,\u201d noted a Publishers Weekly reviewer. Poems like \u201cMy Chili\u201d and \u201cChinese Food in the Fifties\u201d celebrate local dining customs, and \u201cGray Dogs\u201d is one of several poems that contain animal imagery. According to Robert Murray Davis in World Literature Today, R\u00edos \u201cis most successful ... when, on the one hand, he does not strive too hard for paradox and, on the other, when he does not take refuge in mere nostalgia.\u201d The book\u2019s title, taken from the poem \u201cSome Extensions on the Sovereignty of Science,\u201d refers to the stapedius muscle in the ear, which prevents humans from hearing their own heartbeat. \u201cThe muscle does important work I think, but at the same time, it keeps us from something that belongs to us,\u201d R\u00edos told Leslie A. Wootten in World Literature Today. \u201cWe are protected from particular sounds for our own good. There are many things in life we are protected from hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, touching, and feeling. In large measure, the poems in this book\u2014and all my books\u2014struggle to bring into view what we\u2019ve been protected from experiencing. But by this, I mean the small things as well as the large.\u201d\nOne of Chicano culture\u2019s important voices, R\u00edos is dedicated \u201cto finding, declaring, and celebrating the diversity and power of community in the experience of those around him. Thus, his vision is more outward directed, less private than might at first glance be apparent,\u201d contended Robert McDowell in an essay for Contemporary Poets. Sald\u00edvar added that \u201cR\u00edos is surely one of the major vernacular voices in the postmodern age.\u201d\nSince 1982, R\u00edos has taught at Arizona State University, where he is Regents Professor of English and director of the Virginia G. Piper Center for Creative Writing.\u00a0In 2013 he was named Arizona\u2019s first poet laureate. He served as a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets from 2014 to 2020.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
