Although Mexico figures prominently in Paz\u2019s work\u2014one of his best-known books, The Labyrinth of Solitude, for example, is a comprehensive portrait of Mexican society\u2014Los Angeles Timescontributor Jascha Kessler called Paz \u201ctruly international.\u201d World Literature Today\u2019s Manuel Duran felt that Paz\u2019s \u201cexploration of Mexican existential values permit[ted] him to open a door to an understanding of other countries and other cultures\u201d and thus appeal to readers of diverse backgrounds. \u201cWhat began as a slow, almost microscopic examination of self and of a single cultural tradition widens unexpectedly,\u201d Duran continued, \u201cbecoming universal without sacrificing its unique characteristic.\u201d Paz won the Nobel Prize in 1990, and died eight years later at the age of 84. His passing was mourned as the end of an era for Mexico. According to his obituary in Americas, \u201cPaz\u2019s literary career helped to define modern poetry and the Mexican personality.\u201d\n\r\nPaz was born in 1914 near Mexico City, into a prominent family with ties to Mexico\u2019s political, cultural, and military elite. His father served as assistant to Emiliano Zapata, the leader of a popular revolution in 1911. Many Zapatistas were forced into exile when their leader was slain a few years later, and the Paz family relocated to Los Angeles, California, for a time. Back in Mexico City, the family\u2019s economic situation declined, but as a teen, Paz found increasing success for his poems and short stories in local publications. His first volume of poetry, Luna silvestre, appeared in 1933. While attending law school, however, Paz found himself drawn to leftist politics. When he sent some of his work to famed Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, the senior writer gave it a favorable review and encouraged Paz to attend a congress of leftist-thinking writers in Spain.\n\r\nIn Spain Paz was drawn into the raging Civil War and joined a brigade fighting the armies of fascist dictator Francisco Franco. He returned to Mexico with a mission to popularize the Spanish Republican cause, and spent time in both Berkeley, California, and New York City over the next few years as a graduate student, journalist, and translator. In 1946 he was offered a post as Mexico\u2019s cultural attach\u00e9 to France, and served in his country\u2019s diplomatic corps for the next two decades. The work left him enough time to write prodigiously, and during the course of his career he published dozens of volumes of poetry and prose.\n\r\nOne of Paz\u2019s best-known works was El laberinto de la soledad, which appeared first in 1950 and in English translation as The Labyrinth of Solitude: Life and Thought in Mexico eleven years later. \u201cIn it Paz argues that Mexicans see themselves as children of the conquering Spanish father who abandoned his offspring and the treacherous Indian mother who turned against her own people,\u201d explained an Americas essay. \u201cBecause of the wounds that Mexicans suffer as a result of their dual cultural heritage, they have developed a defensive stance, hiding behind masks and taking refuge in a \u2018labyrinth of solitude.\u2019\u201d The volume became standard reading for students of Latin American history and literature.\n\r\nOne aspect of Paz\u2019s work often mentioned by critics is his tendency to maintain elements of prose\u2014most commonly philosophical thought\u2014in his poetry, and poetic elements in his prose. Perhaps the best example to support this claim can be found in Paz\u2019s exploration of India, titled The Monkey Grammarian, a work which New York Times Book Review contributor Keith Botsford called \u201cexceedingly curious\u201d and described as \u201can extended meditation on the nature of language.\u201d In separate World Literature Today essays, critics Jaime Alazraki and Jose Miguel Oviedo discussed the difficulty they would have assigning the book to a literary genre. \u201cIt is apparent,\u201d Alazraki noted, \u201cthat The Monkey Grammarian is not an essay. It is also apparent that it is not a poem, at least not in the conventional sense. It is both an essay and a poem, or perhaps neither.\u201d Oviedo similarly stated that the book \u201cdoes not belong to any specific genre\u2014although it has a bit of all of them\u2014because it is deliberately written at the edge of genres.\u201d\n\r\nAccording to Oviedo, The Monkey Grammarian is the product of Paz\u2019s long-stated quest \u201cto produce a text which would be an intersection of poetry, narrative and essay.\u201d The fusion of opposites found in this work is an important element in nearly all Paz\u2019s literary production. In many instances both the work\u2019s structure and its content represent a blending of contradictory forces: Renga, for example, is written in four languages, while Air Born/Hijos del Aire, is written in two. According to World Literature Today contributor Frances Chiles, Paz strived to create in his writing \u201ca sense of community or communion\u201d which he found lacking in contemporary society. In his Neustadt Prize acceptance speech reprinted in World Literature Today, Paz attempted to explain his emphasis on contrasting thoughts: \u201cPlurality is Universality, and Universality is the acknowledging of the admirable diversity of man and his works. ... To acknowledge the variety of visions and sensibilities is to preserve the richness of life and thus to ensure its continuity.\u201d\n\r\nThrough juxtaposition of contrasting thoughts or objects Paz created a more harmonious world, one based on the complementary association of opposites found in the Eastern concept of yin and yang. This aspect of Paz\u2019s thinking revealed the influence of his six-year stay in India as Mexican ambassador to that country. Grace Schulman explained Paz\u2019s proclivity for Eastern philosophy in a Hudson Review essay: \u201cAlthough he had embraced contraries from the beginning of his writing career ... [Paz] found in Tantric thought and in Hindu religious life dualities that enforced his conviction that history turns on reciprocal rhythms. In Alternating Current, he writes that the Hindu gods, creators or destroyers according to their names and region, manifest contradiction. \u2018Duality,\u2019 he says, \u2018a basic feature of Tantrism, permeates all Hindu religious life: male and female, pure and impure, left and right. ... In Eastern thought, these opposites can co-exist; in Western philosophy, they disappear for the worst reasons: far from being resolved into a higher synthesis, they cancel each other out.\u2019\u201d\n\r\nCritics have pointed to several repeated contrasting images that dramatically capture the essence of Paz\u2019s work. Ronald Christ, for example, commented in his Nation review of Aguila o sol?/Eagle or Sun? (the Spanish portion of which is the equivalent of the English expression \u201cheads or tails?\u201d): \u201cThe dual image of the Mexican coin which gives Eagle or Sun? its title epitomizes Paz\u2019s technique and credo, for we see that there is no question of eagle or sun, rather of eagle and sun which together in their oppositeness are the same coin.\u201d Another of the poet\u2019s images which reviewers frequently have mentioned is \u201cburnt water,\u201d an ancient Mexican concept which appears in Paz\u2019s work in both Spanish and in the Aztec original, \u201catl tlachinolli.\u201d Schulman maintained that \u201cburnt water\u201d is \u201cthe dominant image of [Paz\u2019s] poetry\u201d and found that the image fulfills a role similar to that of the two sides of the coin in Eagle and Sun? She noted: \u201cPaz sees the world burning, and knows with visionary clarity that opposites are resolved in a place beyond contraries, in a moment of pure vision: in that place, there are no frontiers between men and women, life and death.\u201d Chiles called the Aztec combination of fire and water \u201cparticularly apt in its multiple connotations as a symbol of the union of all warring contraries.\u201d\n\r\nIn Sor Juana; or, The Traps of Faith, Paz examined the literary achievement of Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, a seventeenth-century New Spain nun and poetess who produced masterful verse from a convent in Mexico City. New York Times Book Review contributor Frederick Luciani wrote, \u201cHer extant works ... are of such abundance and variety, in such a range of styles, voices and manners, as to be simultaneously seductive and bewildering. With characteristic lucidity, Mr. Paz sorts through this textual morass and arrives at an admiring and sympathetic portrait, but an honest and demythologizing one, too.\u201d To understand his subject, Paz addressed the complex and turbulent civilization of colonial Mexico. \u201cIt is, after all,\u201d according to Jonathan Keates in the London Observer, \u201cnot only the nun\u2019s tale but that of Mexico itself, the kingdom of New Spain, its imposed framework of ideal constructs eroded by mutual resentment between governors and governed and by a chronic fear of change.\u201d According to Electa Arenal in Criticism, \u201c Sor Juana; or, The Traps of Faithis a tour de force\u2014biography, cultural history and ideological criticism all in one. It describes the intellectual, political and religious climate of sixteenth and seventeenth-century Mexico; comments on the poet as rebel against orthodoxy, then and now; and studies the life, times, and art of a woman with whom Paz identifies and to whom he implicitly compares himself.\u201d\n\r\nWith La llama doble: Amor y erotisma, translated as The Double Flame, Paz provided a social and literary history of love and eroticism, comparing modern manifestations to those of earlier ages, while noting the special relationship between eroticism and poetry. \u201cThis book is a product of immense wisdom and patient observation, an approach to passion from the vantage of maturity,\u201d wrote Ilan Stavans in Washington Post Book World. \u201cHis ultimate thesis is that our society is plagued by erotic permissiveness, placing the stability and continuity of love in jeopardy, and that the difficult encounter between two humans attracted to each other, has lost importance, a development that he believes threatens our psychological and cultural foundations.\u201d According to Paz, \u201cBoth love and eroticism\u2014the double flame\u2014are fed by the original fire: sexuality.\u201d\n\r\nIn The Other Voice: Essays on Modern Poetry, Paz offered a critique of contemporary poetry, including an analysis of the Romantics and Symbolists and a forceful objection to postmodernism and consumerism. Though noting Paz\u2019s conservative New Critic perspective, Raymond Leslie Williams wrote in American Book Review, \u201cThe breadth of Paz\u2019s literary repertoire in this volume, as in all his writing, is impressive. His understanding of Pound, Eliot, Apollinaire, and many other modern poets is vast.\u201d Paz emphasized the unifying power of poetry and asserted the importance of a public audience. \u201cThe volume\u2019s prevailing theme,\u201dwrote Ilan Stavans in a Nation review, is \u201cpoetry as a nonconformist, rebellious force of the modern age.\u201d Stavans observed, \u201cPaz argues that while poets are elitists by nature, despite the tiny circulation of their craft it has a profound impact on society.\u201d For Paz, as John Butt wrote in the Times Literary Supplement, \u201cthe poem aspires to be all-encompassing, an image of what a unified theory of life might be, \u2018a miniature, animated cosmos\u2019 which \u2018unites the ten thousand things\u2019 that swirl around us.\u201d\n\r\nCritics have agreed that Paz\u2019s great theme of a blended reality situated his work in the forefront of modern literature. As Christ noted: \u201cBy contraries then, by polarities and divergences converging in a rhetoric of opposites, Paz established himself as a brilliant stylist balancing the tension of East and West, art and criticism, the many and the one in the figures of his writing. Paz is thus not only a great writer: he is also an indispensable corrective to our cultural tradition and a critic in the highest sense in which he himself uses the word.\u201d Enrique Fernandez similarly saw Octavio Paz as a writer of enormous influence. \u201cNot only has he left his mark on world poetry, with a multilingual cortege of acolytes,\u201d Fernandez wrote in a Village Voice essay, \u201che is a force to be reckoned with by anyone who chooses that modernist imitaio Christi, the Life of the Mind.\u201d\n\r\nPaz ended his diplomatic career in protest in 1968 over Mexico\u2019s suppression of student demonstrations in his hometown. The Asian subcontinent, however, continued to hold sway over him creatively. In 1997, his collection A Tale of Two Gardens: Poems from India, 1952-1995 appeared. A review from Barbara Mujica in Americas described the poet as \u201cobsessed with India. Although many American and European writers have been fascinated with the subcontinent, none has studied its culture with the intensity and thoroughness of Paz.\u201d Some of the poems in the collection were written in a short Sanskrit form called kayva; the form was also used for some verse that appeared in Paz\u2019s prose memoir, In Light of India, also published in 1997. As Mujica noted, \u201cIn the kavya, Paz evokes exquisite and fleeting erotic images\u2014a young bather emerging from the river, silks slipping off bodies and fluttering in the breeze. ... These verses are tiny treasures\u2014delicate, suggestive, and profound.\u201d\n\r\nPaz was an active critic of politics for nearly all of his career. Unlike some other leftist Latin American writers\u2014Gabriel Garc\u00eda Marquez, for example\u2014Paz was not a supporter of Communist Cuban leader Fidel Castro. He also criticized Nicaragua\u2019s Sandinista guerrilla movement; Mexican demonstrations of solidarity with the Sandinista movement sometimes included the burning of an effigy of Paz. Nor was he a champion of the Zapatista uprising that fomented in a mountainous Mexican state in 1994. The writer, in both his writings and public utterances, defended his views ardently. \u201cRevolution begins as a promise,\u201d Paz wrote, according to the New Republic, \u201cis squandered in violent agitation, and freezes into bloody dictatorships that are the negation of the fiery impulse that brought it into being. In all revolutionary movements, the sacred time of myth is transformed inexorably into the profane time of history.\u201d\n\r\nPaz\u2019s death was announced by no less than the president of Mexico, Ernesto Zedillo. \u201cThis is an irreplaceable loss for contemporary thought and culture\u2014not just for Latin America but for the entire world,\u201d Notimex, the government news agency, quoted Zedillo as saying. Gabriel Zaid, who co-founded the literary journal Vuelta with Paz, recalled his last public appearance, in December of 1997, in a piece for Time International. \u201cThe day was overcast and gray,\u201d Zaid wrote. \u201cOctavio spoke of the sun, of gratitude and of grace. And the sun, as if engaged in conversation, peered down on him through the clouds.\u201d\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Mexico"]}}
