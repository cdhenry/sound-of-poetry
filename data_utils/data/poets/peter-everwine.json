Philip Levine once wrote that Everwine's poems \u201care like no other in our language: they possess the simplicity and clarity I find in the great Spanish poems of Antonio Machado and his contemporary Juan Ramon Jiminez but in contemporary American English and in the rhythms of our speech, that rhythm glorified. He presents us with poetry in which each moment is recorded, laid bare, and sanctified, which is to say the poems possess a quality one finds only in the greatest poetry.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nEverwine was the recipient of multiple awards and honors, including a Pushcart Prize, fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, and a Guggenheim Fellowship, among others. His poetry was featured in the Paris Review, the American Poetry Review, and others. He also translated poetry from the Hebrew and Aztec languages.\n\r\nEverwine taught at the California State University, Fresno, and Reed College. He lived in Fresno, California, until his death in late 2018.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
