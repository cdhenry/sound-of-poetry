He earned a BA at the University of Queensland. In an article for The Pulse, Herrick noted the narrative elements at work in his poetry: \u201cPeople think poetry is about really static, old, boring things like a tree or a river. My poetry is about a boy who jumps in the river. I don\u2019t write descriptive poems. I write stories in verse.\u201d \u00a0 His young adult verse-novels include Cold Skin (2007) and By the River (2004). His collections of poetry for children include Untangling Spaghetti: Selected Poems (2009) and the New South Wales Premier\u2019s Literary Award winner The Spangled Drongo: A Verse Novel (1999). He is also the author of the memoir Slice: Juicy Moments from My Impossible Life (2010). \u00a0 He lives with his family in Katoomba, near Sydney, Australia. \ufeff\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Australia"]}}
