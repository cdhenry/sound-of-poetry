When she moved to the United States in 2005, she had already published her first book, I\u2019m as Thin as Your Eyelashes, and was known across the world as an electrifying reader of her poems. Her debut collection in America, Factory of Tears (2008), received acclaim: the New Yorker writes, \u201cMort strives to be an envoy for her native country, writing with almost alarming vociferousness about the struggle to establish a clear identity for Belarus and its language.\u201d She composes her poems in Belarusian as attempts are being made to revitalize the traditional language, which lends her work both conventional and groundbreaking tones. Mort reads in both Belarusian and English, and so the poem \u201cNew York\u201d provides an ideal context for her poetry, as readers are presented with a young foreign poet\u2019s impressions of the infamous city. Mort is also the author of the poetry collection Collected Body (2011) and co-editor, with Ilya Kaminsky and Katie Ferris, of Gossip and Metaphysics: Russian Modernist Poems and Prose (2014).\n\r\nMort received the Crystal of Vilenica award in Slovenia in 2005 and the Burda Poetry Prize in Germany in 2008. She\u00a0teaches at Cornell University and lives in Ithaca, New York.\n", "attrs": {}}
