He earned his BA from Howard University and his MFA from the California Institute of the Arts and is also a graduate and fellow of Cave Canem. Kearney\u2019s full-length poetry collections include Fear, Some (2006), The Black Automaton (2009), which was chosen by Catherine Wagner for the National Poetry Series, and\u00a0Patter\u00a0(2014). He has also published many chapbooks. His poetry has appeared in several anthologies, including The Ringing Ear: Black Poets Lean South (2007, edited by Nikky Finney), Spoken Word Revolution Redux (2007, edited by Mark Eleveld), Dark Matter: Reading the Bones (2005, edited by Sheree R. Thomas), and Role Call: A Generational Anthology of Social and Political Black Art & Literature (2002, edited by Tony Medina, Samiya Bashir, and Quraysh Ali Lansana).\nKearney\u2019s lyrical poems range across the page, bridging thematic concerns such as politics, African-American culture, masks, the Trickster figure, and contemporary music. He describes the nontraditional layout of his poems as \u201cperformative typography.\u201d As he explained in a conversation with poet Amaud J. Johnson for the Boxcar Poetry Review, \u201cI wanted to take what I knew about poetics and, say, graphic design and try to figure out the dynamics of certain poetic devices.\u201d In the same conversation, Kearney discussed the relationship between his poetry and politics: \u201cFor me, the political is a part of how I see the world \u2026 my art making doesn\u2019t begin without realizing who I am and what it means for me to be writing a poem and not doing something else.\u201d In the Los Angeles Times, poet David St. John observed, \u201cWhat Doug\u2019s articulating is the fragmentation of the self and sensibility that you see prominently in T.S. Eliot and The Waste Land. He\u2019s at the other end of the century, using a multicultural voice inflected with the concerns of what it means to be a young black man at this time and at this place.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nKearney\u2019s honors include a Whiting Writers Award, a Pushcart nomination, and commissions for new work from Minneapolis\u2019s Weisman Art Museum and New York\u2019s Studio Museum. In 2007, he was named a Notable New American Poet by the Poetry Society of America. Kearney has also received fellowships and scholarships from Idyllwild Summer Arts Poetry Workshop, Cave Canem, the Callaloo Creative Writing Workshops, and the Bread Loaf Writers\u2019 Conference. He is the recipient of the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Cy Twombly award. He teaches at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn January 2011, Kearney was a featured writer on Harriet.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
