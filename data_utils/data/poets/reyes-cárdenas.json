He is the author of Anti-Bicicleta Haiku (1976), Survivors of the Chicano Titanic (1981), Elegies For John Lennon (1984, 2006), I Was Never A Militant Chicano (1986), and Chicano Poet: 1970\u20132010 (2013). In his work, he takes inspiration from pop culture, politics, and Chicano identity. C\u00e1rdenas is a machinist by trade, and his work is just now emerging as an important body of writing in Chicano poetry.  \u00a0 Critic and Tejano scholar Juan Rodriguez wrote of C\u00e1rdenas: \u201cWhen I think of Reyes C\u00e1rdenas and his place in Chicano letters, my mind immediately places him alongside another great, but little known, Chicano artist, folk singer Sixto \u2018Sugar Man\u2019 Rodr\u00edguez. Despite the keen mastery of their respective art forms, both have been neglected\u2014up to now\u2014by the general American public and, sadly, by their own ethnic community. This may be because both are humble human beings who, unlike many of their colleagues, do not self-promote, preferring instead to let their art speak for itself. And in both cases, their art speaks in a thunderous voice that demands our attention.\u201d\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
