He earned his MFA in poetry from Columbia University and a PhD in literature from the University of California, Santa Cruz. In 1975, he won a first Chicano Literary Prize. Arteaga is considered a pioneer in both postcolonial and ethnic minority studies as well as an important Chicano movement poet. He trained as a Renaissance scholar, and his major scholarly works focused on \u201cinterlingual\u201d and \u201cintercultural\u201d discourses and perspectives. Interested in the merging of European and indigenous cultures of the Americas after European contact and colonization and often focusing on post-1965 Chicano/a artists and intellectuals, Arteaga\u2019s scholarship and teaching interests spanned centuries. In his seminal anthology, An Other Tongue: Nation and Ethnicity in the Linguistic Borderlands (1994), he collected essays from intellectuals such as Jean Luc Nancy and Gayatri Spivak, among others. Arteaga\u2019s own scholarly works include Chicano Poetics: Heterotexts and Hybridities (1997) and the essay collection House with the Blue Bed (1997).  \u00a0 Arteaga\u2019s creative work was likewise concerned with the potential of cross-cultural poetics. His books of poetry include Cantos (1991), Love in the Time of Aftershocks (1998), Red (2000), and Fr\u00f8zen Accident (2006). In 1999, he suffered his first heart attack, followed by a six-week coma. According to Laura E. P\u00e9rez, \u201cHe emerged from that fateful passage intellectually and spiritually renewed and focused, and staged this ambitious and accomplished cycle of poems in dialogue between pre-Columbian and modern (Wittgenstein) and post-structuralist European philosophies, echoing the works of the philosopher, poet, and prince of pre-Columbian Mexico, Nezahualcoyotl, that perhaps there is no better way to speak truth on this earthly plain than through \u2018flower, song,\u2019 that is, poetry, for we, like life itself, are the Divine\u2019s own beautiful, if perishable, flower-like canto.\u201d Arteaga\u2019s last book, Zero Act (2008), was published posthumously. \u00a0 Arteaga received numerous honors and awards for his work, including the Irvine Chicano Literary Prize and the PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Writing Award. He also received fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. Arteaga taught at the University of California-Berkeley for many years and received tenure in the Department of Ethnic Studies. Widely published and influential as a scholar, Arteaga was also honored by the inscription of his poetry into the sidewalks of Berkeley as part of the anthology Addison Street: The Berkeley Poetry Walk (2004). In 2005, Arteaga suffered a second heart attack; in 2006, he traveled to Thailand to receive an innovative stem cell treatment. He died in California in 2008 after a third heart attack.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
