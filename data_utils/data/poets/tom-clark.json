In addition to dozens of books of poetry, a play, two novels, two story collections, and numerous biographies of literary figures, Clark\u2019s works included a book co-written with star baseball pitcher Mark Fidrych, poems about such sports legends as Catfish Hunter, Vida Blue, and Bert Campaneris, and a history of the Oakland A\u2019s baseball team. As Steven Young noted, \u201cClark is a fan; he doesn\u2019t write about baseball, he celebrates it.\u201d Clark easily finessed the apparent gap between his interests in poetry and sports: \u201cI think they have a natural relationship,\u201d he once wrote. \u201cThe best poems and the best baseball games share a dramatic tension you can\u2019t find in very many other places.\u201d In his essay for the Contemporary Authors Autobiography Series, Clark tells how his \u201creligious involvement\u201d in baseball developed at an early age, fostered initially by his father, who took him to his first big-league games at Comiskey Park on Chicago\u2019s South Side. He describes \u201csuddenly emerging through a tunnel into the radiantly illuminated, enchanted emerald green space,\u201d and goes on to state: \u201cPerhaps religion is the wrong term, though. Part hobby, part escape hatch from endarkened household, for me baseball opened up a secret door in the wall to numinous worlds religion promised but never delivered.\u201d\n\r\nClark\u2019s interest in poetry blossomed at the University of Michigan, where he listed his early influences as Rilke, Wallace Stevens, Theodore Roethke, and Boris Pasternak. However, the contemporary academic poets he met at that time failed to impress him, later causing him to reject the chance to become \u201ca university poet... thus irrevocably exiting, with a headstrong lack of foresight surely to be regretted, the moving staircase of academic poetry-careering.\u201d Taking an advanced degree at Cambridge, Clark became strongly influenced by the work of Ezra Pound. While in England, he hitchhiked around the country with Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, and gave readings and associated with other writers such as Robert Graves, Gregory Corso, Andrei Voznesensky, and Adrian Mitchell. For ten years, starting in 1963, after being recommended to publisher George Plimpton by his former teacher, poet Donald Hall, Clark served as poetry editor of the prestigious Paris Review.\nClark\u2019s poems ranged across many subjects and styles. He wrote parodies of traditional poetry in The Mutabilitie of the English Lyrick (1979), poems of tribute to such figures as Lenny Bruce, and political poems. Lewis Warsh in Poetry claimed that Clark lets \u201cgo of all restrictions as to what goes into the poem while creating the ability to make everything come out right.\u201d He possessed, Chad Walsh wrote in Book World, \u201cthe ability to look at the ordinary world and see it for the first time, with the freshness of a Zen Buddhist painting a landscape or composing a haiku.\u201d\n\r\nMany of Clark\u2019s poems were topical, political, and engaged with American experience. In The End of the Line (1980), for example, Clark presents an \u201caffecting, anguished vision of a collapsing America,\u201d Amy Gerstler wrote in Poetry News. While in Paradise Resisted (1984), he examined the American West, offering \u201ca wide-ranging body of work examining \u2018the West\u2019\u2014a state of mind, unique geographical terrains, qualities of light, restless, boundless dreams,\u201d according to Don Skiles in the San Francisco Chronicle. Clark\u2019s collection Sleepwalker\u2019s Fate: New and Selected Poems, 1965-1991 (1992) offered a significant collection of his poetic work over several decades. Reviewing the book for the San Francisco Chronicle, Joel Lewis explained that \u201cClark has been one of American poetry\u2019s most consistent and constant chroniclers of our long sleepwalk to parts unknown... What we have... in the \u2018Sleepwalker\u2019s Fate\u2019 is poetry\u2019s first successful X-ray of [the] American psyche as it swims through the \u201890s.\u201d Writing in Small Press, Peggy Shumaker found the collection to be \u201ccomplex, alive in every line, tender, unbearable, and necessary. Clark embraces in one book twenty-five years of poems, plus baseball, classicism, jazz, physics, trout kills, popular culture, \u2018the smashed weirdness of the raving cadenzas of God,\u2019 and \u2018infinite gifts we are unable to discern.\u2019\u201d Clark was a prolific poet who published dozens of collections. His work since the 1990s included volumes such as Zombie Dawn (with poet Anne Waldman, 2003), Night Sky (2004), Threnody (2005), Light & Shade: New and Selected Poems (2006), The New World (2009), Something in the Air (2010), At the Fair (2010), Canyonesque (2011), Distance (2012), and Truth Game (2013).\nIn prose, Clark\u00a0his made a mark as a (sometimes semi-fictional) biographer of pop musician Neil Young, and of such literary figures as Damon Runyon, Jack Kerouac, Ted Berrigan, Louis Ferdinand Celine, Charles Olson, and Robert Creeley. Clark\u2019s 1984 biography of Jack Kerouac draws on previous studies and personal accounts to give an overview of the Beat novelist\u2019s career. Clark focuses in particular on how Kerouac used the details of his life to create memorable fiction. The biography, John Montgomery noted in the Toronto Globe and Mail, \u201cis an antidote and a model for academics who usually aren\u2019t able to cope with a writer like Kerouac.\u201d In tackling the life of poet Charles Olson, Clark again provided a study of the relationship between a writer and his work. His Charles Olson: The Allegory of a Poet\u2019s Life (1991) was, according to Bruce Campbell in the Review of Contemporary Fiction, \u201cclear, compelling, and makes Olson\u2019s life more coherent than it has ever been.\u201d \u201cOlson,\u201d writes Thomas M. Disch in the Los Angeles Times Book Review, \u201cwas a pioneer in the dismantling of the college core curriculum and its replacement by a kind of autodidacticism that differed little from autointoxication. He was, in short, the high priest of high times, and Tom Clark\u2019s biography is a balefully fascinating account of both the man and the milieu he did so much to form.\u201d\n\r\nClark\u2019s honors and awards included fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts. He taught at the New College of California for many years. Clark died in 2018 in Berkeley, California.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"], "School/Period:": ["New York School (2nd Generation)"]}}
