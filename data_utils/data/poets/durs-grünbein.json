He has published numerous collections of poetry and essays in German, including most recently Z\u00fcndkerzen (2017). Gr\u00fcnbein has also translated a variety of authors, including John Ashbery, Samuel Beckett, Henri Michaux, and the classic texts Aeschylus\u2019s The Persians and Seneca\u2019s Thyestes.\u00a0\nGr\u00fcnbein\u2019s poetry is witty, wry, perceptive, and influenced by a broad range of literary texts while it presents the disillusionment of having grown up in East Germany and explores Germany\u2019s new identity in post-Cold War Europe. Critic Helen Vendler, writing in the New Republic, commented on the \u201csardonic humor, the savagery, the violent candor\u2014all expressed in lines of cool formal elegance.\u201d Philip Ottermann, in The Independent, noted Gr\u00fcnbein\u2019s range: \u201cGr\u00fcnbein loves to jump from one register to another\u2014one moment he is the street poet of Berlin, the next \u2026 all marble and ancient philosophy.\u201d One poem, \u201cVita Brevis,\u201d begins with a statement of despair: \u201cIn a rotten nutshell, I grew up amid the barrenness and confusion.\u201d\nHis poems have been translated into English by Michael Hofmann and published in Ashes for Breakfast: Selected Poems (2005). He received the Georg B\u00fcchner Prize in 1995, the 2000 Salzburg Easter Festival Literature Prize, and the 2004 Friedrich Nietzsche Literature Prize of the federal state of Sachsen-Anhalt Literature Prize.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Germany"]}}
