She was a much-honored poet, even in her lifetime, with the distinction of being the first Black author to win the Pulitzer Prize. She also was poetry consultant to the Library of Congress\u2014the first Black woman to hold that position\u2014and poet laureate of the State of Illinois. Many of Brooks\u2019s works display a political consciousness, especially those from the 1960s and later, with several of her poems reflecting the civil rights activism of that period. Her body of work gave her, according to critic George E. Kent, \u201ca unique position in American letters. Not only has she combined a strong commitment to racial identity and equality with a mastery of poetic techniques, but she has also managed to bridge the gap between the academic poets of her generation in the 1940s and the young Black militant writers of the 1960s.\u201d\n\r\nBrooks was born in Topeka, Kansas, but her family moved to Chicago when she was young. Her father was a janitor who had hoped to become a doctor; her mother was a schoolteacher and classically trained pianist. They were supportive of their daughter\u2019s passion for reading and writing. Brooks was 13 when her first published poem, \u201cEventide,\u201d appeared in\u00a0American Childhood;\u00a0by the time she was 17 she was publishing poems frequently in the\u00a0Chicago Defender,\u00a0a newspaper serving Chicago\u2019s African American population. After attending junior college and working for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, she developed her craft in poetry workshops and began writing the poems, focusing on urban Black experience, that comprised her first collection,\u00a0A Street in Bronzeville (1945).\n\r\nHer poems in\u00a0A Street in Bronzeville\u00a0and the Pulitzer Prize-winning\u00a0Annie Allen\u00a0(1949) were \u201cdevoted to small, carefully cerebrated, terse portraits of the Black urban poor,\u201d commented Richard K. Barksdale in\u00a0Modern Black Poets: A Collection of Critical Essays. Brooks once described her style as \u201cfolksy narrative,\u201d but she varied her forms, using free verse, sonnets, and other models. Several critics welcomed Brooks as a new voice in poetry; fellow poet Rolfe Humphries wrote in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0that \u201cwe have, in\u00a0A Street in Bronzeville,\u00a0a good book and a real poet,\u201d while\u00a0Saturday Review of Literature\u00a0contributor Starr Nelson called that volume \u201ca work of art and a poignant social document.\u201d In\u00a0Annie Allen,\u00a0which follows the experiences of a Black girl as she grows into adulthood, Brooks married social issues, especially around gender, with experimentation: one section of the book is an epic poem, \u201cThe Anniad\u201d\u2014a play on\u00a0The Aeneid.\u00a0Langston Hughes, in a review of\u00a0Annie Allen for\u00a0Voices,\u00a0remarked that \u201cthe people and poems in Gwendolyn Brooks\u2019 book are alive, reaching, and very much of today.\u201d\n\r\nIn the 1950s Brooks published her first and only novel,\u00a0Maud Martha (1953),\u00a0which details its title character\u2019s life in short vignettes. Maud suffers prejudice not only from white people but also from lighter-skinned African Americans, something that mirrored Brooks\u2019s experience. Eventually, Maud takes a stand for her own dignity by turning her back on a patronizing, racist store clerk. One way of looking at the book, then,\u201d commented Harry B. Shaw \u201cis as a war with\u2026 people\u2019s concepts of beauty.\u201d In a\u00a0Black World\u00a0review, Annette Oliver Shands noted the way in which \u201cBrooks does not specify traits, niceties or assets for members of the Black community to acquire in order to attain their just rights\u2026 So, this is not a novel to inspire social advancement on the part of fellow Blacks. Nor does it say\u00a0be poor, Black and happy.\u00a0The message is to accept the challenge of being human and to assert humanness with urgency.\u201d\n\r\nBrooks\u2019s later work took on politics more overtly, displaying what\u00a0National Observer\u00a0contributor Bruce Cook termed \u201can intense awareness of the problems of color and justice.\u201d Toni Cade Bambara reported in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0that at the age of 50 \u201csomething happened to Brooks, a something most certainly in evidence in\u00a0In the Mecca (1968)\u00a0and subsequent works\u2014a new movement and energy, intensity, richness, power of statement and a new stripped lean, compressed style. A change of style prompted by a change of mind.\u201d This shift or change is often depicted as the result of Brooks\u2019s attendance at a gathering of Black writers at Fisk University in 1967; however, recent scholars such as Evie Shockley and Cheryl Clark challenge the idea that Brooks\u2019s career can be so neatly divided. Clark, for example, has described In the Mecca as Brooks\u2019s \u201cfinal seminar on the Western lyric.\u201d Brooks herself noted that the poets at Fisk were committed to writing as Blacks, about Blacks, and for a Black audience. If many of her earlier poems had fulfilled this aim, it was not due to conscious intent, she said; but from this time forward, Brooks thought of herself as an African determined not to compromise social comment for the sake of technical proficiency.\n\r\nAlthough\u00a0In the Mecca\u00a0and Brooks\u2019s subsequent works have been characterized as possessing what a\u00a0Virginia Quarterly Review\u00a0critic called \u201craw power and roughness,\u201d several commentators emphasized that these poems are neither bitter nor vengeful. Instead, according to Cook, they are more \u201cabout bitterness\u201d than bitter in themselves.\u00a0Essayist Charles Israel suggested that\u00a0In the Mecca\u2019s title poem, for example, shows \u201ca deepening of Brooks\u2019s concern with social problems.\u201d A mother has lost a small daughter in the block-long ghetto tenement, the Mecca; the long poem traces her steps through the building, revealing her neighbors to be indifferent or insulated by their own personal obsessions. The mother finds her little girl, who \u201cnever learned that black is not beloved,\u201d who \u201cwas royalty when poised, / sly, at the A and P\u2019s fly-open door,\u201d under a Jamaican resident\u2019s cot, murdered. R. Baxter Miller, writing in\u00a0Black American Poets between Worlds, 1940-1960, observed, \u201cIn the Mecca\u00a0is a most complex and intriguing book; it seeks to balance the sordid realities of urban life with an imaginative process of reconciliation and redemption.\u201d Other poems in the book, occasioned by the death of Malcolm X or the dedication of a mural of Black heroes painted on a Chicago slum building, express Brooks\u2019s commitment to her community\u2019s awareness of themselves as a political as well as a cultural entity.\n\r\nBrooks\u2019s activism and her interest in nurturing Black literature led her to leave major publisher Harper & Row in favor of fledgling Black publishing companies. In the 1970s, she chose\u00a0Dudley Randall\u2019s Broadside Press to publish her poetry collections Riot (1969), Family Pictures (1970), Aloneness (1971), Aurora (1972),\u00a0and\u00a0Beckonings (1975) and\u00a0Report from Part One (1972),\u00a0the first volume of her autobiography. She edited two collections of poetry\u2014A Broadside Treasury\u00a0(1971) and\u00a0Jump Bad: A New Chicago Anthology (1971)\u2014for the Detroit-area press. The Chicago-based Third World Press, run by\u00a0Haki R. Madhubuti\u2014formerly Don L. Lee, one of the young poets she had met during the 1960s\u2014also brought many Brooks titles into print. Brooks was the first writer to read in Broadside\u2019s original Poet\u2019s Theatre series and was also the first poet to read in the second opening of the series when the press was revived under new ownership in 1988. Brooks, however, felt that\u00a0Riot, Family Pictures, Beckonings,\u00a0and other books brought out by Black publishers were given only brief notice by critics of the literary establishment because they \u201cdid not wish to encourage Black publishers.\u201d\nLater Brooks poems continue to deal with political subjects and figures, such as South African activist Winnie Mandela, the onetime wife of antiapartheid leader\u2014and later president of the country\u2014Nelson Mandela. Brooks once told interviewer George Stavros: \u201cI want to write poems that will be non-compromising. I don\u2019t want to stop a concern with words doing good jobs, which has always been a concern of mine, but I want to write poems that will be meaningful\u2026 things that will touch them.\u201d Brooks\u2019s work was objective about human nature, several reviewers observed. Janet Overmeyer noted in the\u00a0Christian Science Monitor\u00a0that Brooks\u2019s \u201cparticular, outstanding, genius is her unsentimental regard and respect for all human beings\u2026 She neither foolishly pities nor condemns\u2014she creates.\u201d Overmeyer continued, \u201cFrom her poet\u2019s craft bursts a whole gallery of wholly alive persons, preening, squabbling, loving, weeping; many a novelist cannot do so well in ten times the space.\u201d Littlejohn maintained that Brooks achieves this effect through a high \u201cdegree of artistic control,\u201d further relating, \u201cThe words, lines, and arrangements have been worked and worked and worked again into poised exactness: the unexpected apt metaphor, the mock-colloquial asides amid jewelled phrases, the half-ironic repetitions\u2014she knows it all.\u201d More important, Brooks\u2019s objective treatment of issues such as poverty and racism \u201cproduces genuine emotional tension,\u201d the critic wrote.\n\r\nAmong Brooks\u2019s major prose works are her two volumes of autobiography. When Report from Part One\u00a0was published, some reviewers expressed disappointment that it did not provide the level of personal detail or the insight into Black literature that they had expected. \u201cThey wanted a list of domestic spats,\u201d remarked Brooks. Bambara noted that it \u201cis not a sustained dramatic narrative for the nosey, being neither the confessions of a private woman poet or the usual sort of mahogany-desk memoir public personages inflict upon the populace at the first sign of a cardiac\u2026 It documents the growth of Gwen Brooks.\u201d Other critics praised the book for explaining the poet\u2019s new orientation toward her racial heritage and her role as a poet. In a passage she presented again in later books as a definitive statement, Brooks wrote: \u201cI\u2014who have \u2018gone the gamut\u2019 from an almost angry rejection of my dark skin by some of my brainwashed brothers and sisters to a surprised queenhood in the new Black sun\u2014am qualified to enter at least the kindergarten of new consciousness now. New consciousness and trudge-toward-progress. I have hopes for myself\u2026 I know now that I am essentially an essential African, in occupancy here because of an indeed \u2018peculiar\u2019 institution\u2026 I know that Black fellow-feeling must be the Black man\u2019s encyclopedic Primer. I know that the Black-and-white integration concept, which in the mind of some beaming early saint was a dainty spinning dream, has wound down to farce\u2026 I know that the Black emphasis must be not\u00a0against white\u00a0but\u00a0FOR Black\u2026 In the Conference-That-Counts, whose date may be 1980 or 2080 (woe betide the Fabric of Man if it is 2080), there will be no looking up nor looking down.\u201d In the future, she envisioned \u201cthe profound and frequent shaking of hands, which in Africa is so important. The shaking of hands in warmth and strength and union.\u201d\n\r\nBrooks put some of the finishing touches on the second volume of her autobiography while serving as poetry consultant to the Library of Congress. Brooks was 68 when she became the first Black woman to be appointed to the post. Of her many duties there, the most important, in her view, were visits to local schools. Similar visits to colleges, universities, prisons, hospitals, and drug rehabilitation centers characterized her tenure as poet laureate of Illinois. In that role, she sponsored and hosted annual literary awards ceremonies at which she presented prizes funded \u201cout of her own pocket, which, despite her modest means, is of legendary depth,\u201d\u00a0Reginald Gibbons\u00a0related in Chicago\u00a0Tribune Books.\u00a0She honored and encouraged many poets in her state through the Illinois Poets Laureate Awards and Significant Illinois Poets Awards programs.\n\r\nProving the breadth of Brooks\u2019s appeal, poets representing a wide variety of \u201craces and\u2026 poetic camps\u201d gathered at the University of Chicago to celebrate the poet\u2019s 70th birthday in 1987, Gibbons reported. Brooks brought them together, he said, \u201cin\u2026 a moment of good will and cheer.\u201d In recognition of her service and achievements, a junior high school in Harvey, Illinois, was named for her, and she was similarly honored by Western Illinois University\u2019s Gwendolyn Brooks Center for African-American Literature. In 2017 celebrations of the centenary of Brooks\u2019s birth were held at the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, where Gwendolyn Brooks\u2019s papers are held.\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Black Arts Movement"]}}
