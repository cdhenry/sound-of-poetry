By the time she took her life at the age of 30, Plath already had a following in the literary community. In the ensuing years her work attracted the attention of a multitude of readers, who saw in her singular verse an attempt to catalogue despair, violent emotion, and obsession with death. In the New York Times Book Review, Joyce Carol Oates described Plath as \u201cone of the most celebrated and controversial of postwar poets writing in English.\u201d Intensely autobiographical, Plath\u2019s poems explore her own mental anguish, her troubled marriage to fellow poet Ted Hughes, her unresolved conflicts with her parents, and her own vision of herself. On the World Socialist web site, Margaret Rees observed, \u201cWhether Plath wrote about nature, or about the social restrictions on individuals, she stripped away the polite veneer. She let her writing express elemental forces and primeval fears. In doing so, she laid bare the contradictions that tore apart appearance and hinted at some of the tensions hovering just beneath the surface of the American way of life in the post war period.\u201d Oates put it more simply when she wrote that Plath\u2019s best-known poems, \u201cmany of them written during the final, turbulent weeks of her life, read as if they\u2019ve been chiseled, with a fine surgical instrument, out of arctic ice.\u201d Plath has inspired countless readers and influenced many poets since her death in 1963.\nIn the New York Times Book Review, former US poet laureate Robert Pinsky wrote, \u201cThrashing, hyperactive, perpetually accelerated, the poems of Sylvia Plath catch the feeling of a profligate, hurt imagination, throwing off images and phrases with the energy of a runaway horse or a machine with its throttle stuck wide open. All the violence in her work returns to that violence of imagination, a frenzied brilliance and conviction.\u201d Denis Donoghue made a similar observation, also in the New York Times Book Review: \u201cPlath\u2019s early poems, many of them, offered themselves for sacrifice, transmuting agony, \u2018heart\u2019s waste,\u2019 into gestures and styles.\u201d Donoghue added that \u201cshe showed what self-absorption makes possible in art, and the price that must be paid for it, in the art as clearly as in the death.\u201d Dictionary of Literary Biography essayist Thomas McClanahan wrote, \u201cAt her most articulate, meditating on the nature of poetic inspiration, [Plath] is a controlled voice for cynicism, plainly delineating the boundaries of hope and reality. At her brutal best\u2014and Plath is a brutal poet\u2014she taps a source of power that transforms her poetic voice into a raving avenger of womanhood and innocence.\u201d\nBorn in 1932 in Boston, Plath was the daughter of a German immigrant college professor, Otto Plath, and one of his students, Aurelia Schober. The poet\u2019s early years were spent near the seashore, but her life changed abruptly when her father died in 1940. Some of her most vivid poems, including the well-known \u201cDaddy,\u201d concern her troubled relationship with her authoritarian father and her feelings of betrayal when he died. Financial circumstances forced the Plath family to move to Wellesley, Massachusetts, where Aurelia Plath taught advanced secretarial studies at Boston University. Sylvia Plath was a gifted student who had won numerous awards and had published stories and poetry in national magazines while still in her teens. She attended Smith College on scholarship and continued to excel, winning a Mademoiselle fiction contest one year and garnering a prestigious guest editorship of the magazine the following summer.\nIt was during her undergraduate years that Plath began to suffer the symptoms of severe depression that would ultimately lead to her death. In one of her journal entries, dated June 20, 1958, she wrote: \u201cIt is as if my life were magically run by two electric currents: joyous positive and despairing negative\u2014whichever is running at the moment dominates my life, floods it.\u201d This is an eloquent description of bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression, a very serious illness for which no genuinely effective medications were available during Plath\u2019s lifetime. In August of 1953, at the age of 20, Plath attempted suicide by swallowing sleeping pills. She survived the attempt and was hospitalized, receiving treatment with electro-shock therapy. Her experiences of breakdown and recovery were later turned into fiction for her only published novel, The Bell Jar.\nHaving made a recovery, Plath returned to Smith for her degree. She earned a Fulbright grant to study at Cambridge University in England, and it was there that she met poet Ted Hughes. The two were married in 1956. Plath published two major works during her lifetime, The Bell Jar and a poetry volume titled The Colossus. Both received warm reviews. However, the end of her marriage in 1962 left Plath with two young children to care for and, after an intense burst of creativity that produced the poems in Ariel, she committed suicide by inhaling gas from a kitchen oven.\nTimothy Materer wrote in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, \u201cThe critical reactions to both The Bell Jar and Ariel were inevitably influenced by the manner of Plath\u2019s death at 30.\u201d Hardly known outside poetry circles during her lifetime, Plath became in death more than she might have imagined. Donoghue, for one, stated, \u201cI can\u2019t recall feeling, in 1963, that Plath\u2019s death proved her life authentic or indeed that proof was required. ... But I recall that Ariel was received as if it were a bracelet of bright hair about the bone, a relic more than a book.\u201d Feminists portrayed Plath as a woman driven to madness by a domineering father, an unfaithful husband, and the demands that motherhood made on her genius. Some critics lauded her as a confessional poet whose work \u201cspoke the hectic, uncontrolled things our conscience needed, or thought it needed,\u201d to quote Donoghue. Largely on the strength of Ariel, Plath became one of the best-known female American poets of the 20th century.\nThe writer A. Alvarez, writing in The Savage God, believed that with the poems in Ariel, compiled and published by Hughes, Plath made \u201cpoetry and death inseparable. The one could not exist without the other. And this is right. In a curious way, the poems read as though they were written posthumously.\u201d Robert Penn Warren called Ariel \u201ca unique book, it scarcely seems a book at all, rather a keen, cold gust of reality as though somebody had knocked out a window pane on a brilliant night.\u201d George Steiner wrote, \u201cIt is fair to say that no group of poems since Dylan Thomas\u2019s Deaths and Entrances has had as vivid and disturbing an impact on English critics and readers as has Ariel. ... Reference to Sylvia Plath is constant where poetry and the conditions of its present existence are discussed.\u201d Plath\u2019s growing posthumous reputation inspired younger poets to write as she did. But, as Steiner maintained, her \u201cdesperate integrity\u201d cannot be imitated. Or, as Peter Davison put it, \u201cNo artifice alone could have conjured up such effects.\u201d According to McClanahan, the poems in Ariel \u201care personal testaments to the loneliness and insecurity that plagued her, and the desolate images suggest her apparent fixation with self-annihilation. ... In Ariel, the everyday incidents of living are transformed into the horrifying psychological experiences of the poet.\u201d\nIn Plath\u2019s final poems, wrote Charles Newman in his The Art of Sylvia Plath, \u201cdeath is preeminent but strangely unoppressive. Perhaps it is because there is no longer dialogue, no sense of \u2018Otherness\u2019\u2014she is speaking from a viewpoint which is total, complete. Love and Death, all rivals, are resolved as one within the irreversibility of experience. To reverse Blake, the Heart knows as much as the Eye sees.\u201d Alvarez believed that \u201cthe very source of [Plath\u2019s] creative energy was, it turned out, her self-destructiveness. But it was, precisely, a source of living energy, of her imaginative, creative power. So, though death itself may have been a side issue, it was also an unavoidable risk in writing her kind of poem. My own impression of the circumstances surrounding her eventual death is that she gambled, not much caring whether she won or lost; and she lost.\u201d\nAs a very young poet Plath experimented with the villanelle and other forms. She had been \u201cstimulated\u201d by such writers as D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Virginia Woolf, Henry James, Theodore Roethke, Emily Dickinson, and later by Robert Lowell and Anne Sexton. She has been linked with Lowell and Sexton as a member of the so-called \u201cconfessional\u201d school of poetry. Ted Hughes noted that she shared with them a similar geographical homeland as well as \u201cthe central experience of a shattering of the self, and the labour of fitting it together again or finding a new one.\u201d\nAt times, Plath was able to overcome the \u201ctension between the perceiver and the thing-in-itself by literally becoming the thing-in-itself,\u201d wrote Newman. \u201cIn many instances, it is nature who personifies her.\u201d Similarly, Plath used history \u201cto explain herself,\u201d writing about the Nazi concentration camps as though she had been imprisoned there. She said, \u201cI think that personal experience shouldn\u2019t be a kind of shut box and mirror-looking narcissistic experience. I believe it should be generally relevant, to such things as Hiroshima and Dachau, and so on.\u201d Newman explained that, \u201cin absorbing, personalizing the socio-political catastrophes of the century, [Plath] reminds us that they are ultimately metaphors of the terrifying human mind.\u201d Alvarez noted that the \u201canonymity of pain, which makes all dignity impossible, was Sylvia Plath\u2019s subject.\u201d Her reactions to the smallest desecrations, even in plants, were \u201cextremely violent,\u201d wrote Hughes. \u201cAuschwitz and the rest were merely the open wounds.\u201d In sum, Newman believed, Plath \u201cevolved in poetic voice from the precocious girl, to the disturbed modern woman, to the vengeful magician, to Ariel\u2014God\u2019s Lioness.\u201d\nWhile few critics dispute the power or the substance in Plath\u2019s poetry, some have come to feel that its legacy is one of cynicism, ego-absorption, and a prurient fascination with suicide. Donoghue suggested that \u201cthe moral claims enforced by these poems now seem exorbitant,\u201d adding, \u201cThe thrill we get from such poems is something we have no good cause to admire in ourselves.\u201d McClanahan felt that Plath\u2019s legacy \u201cis one of pain, fear, and traumatic depression, born of the need to destroy the imagistic materialization of \u2018Daddy.\u2019\u201d Nevertheless, the critic concluded, \u201cThe horrifying tone of her poetry underscores a depth of feeling that can be attributed to few other poets, and her near-suicidal attempt to communicate a frightening existential vision overshadows the shaky technique of her final poems. Plath writes of the human dread of dying. Her primitive honesty and emotionalism are her strength.\u201d Critics and scholars have continued to write about Plath, and her relationship with Hughes; a reviewer for the National Post reported that in 2000, there were 104 books in print about Plath.\nNewman considered The Bell Jar a \u201ctesting ground\u201d for Plath\u2019s poems. It is, according to the critic, \u201cone of the few American novels to treat adolescence from a mature point of view. ... It chronicles a nervous breakdown and consequent professional therapy in non-clinical language. And finally, it gives us one of the few sympathetic portraits of what happens to one who has genuinely feminist aspirations in our society, of a girl who refuses to be an event in anyone\u2019s life. ... [Plath] remains among the few woman writers in recent memory to link the grand theme of womanhood with the destiny of modern civilization.\u201d Plath told Alvarez that she published the book under a pseudonym partly because \u201cshe didn\u2019t consider it a serious work ... and partly because she thought too many people would be hurt by it.\u201d\nThe Bell Jar is narrated by 19-year-old Esther Greenwood. The three-part novel explores Esther\u2019s unsatisfactory experiences as a student editor in Manhattan, her subsequent return to her family home, where she suffers a breakdown and attempts suicide, and her recovery with the aid of an enlightened female doctor. One of the novel\u2019s themes, the search for a valid personal identity, is as old as fiction itself. The other, a rebellion against conventional female roles, was slightly ahead of its time. Nancy Duvall Hargrove observed in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, \u201cAs a novel of growing up, of initiation into adulthood, [The Bell Jar] is very solidly in the tradition of the Bildungsroman. Technically, The Bell Jar is skillfully written and contains many of the haunting images and symbols that dominate Plath\u2019s poetry.\u201d Materer commented that the book \u201cis a finely plotted novel full of vivid characters and written in the astringent but engaging style one expects from a poet as frank and observant as Plath. The atmosphere of hospitals and sickness, of incidents of bleeding and electrocution, set against images of confinement and liberation, unify the novel\u2019s imagery.\u201d Hargrove maintained that the novel is \u201ca striking work which has contributed to [Plath\u2019s] reputation as a significant figure in contemporary American literature. ... It is more than a feminist document, for it presents the enduring human concerns of the search for identity, the pain of disillusionment, and the refusal to accept defeat.\u201d\nLetters Home, a collection of Plath\u2019s correspondence between 1950 and 1963, reveals that the source of her inner turmoil was perhaps more accurately linked to her relationship with her mother. The volume, published by Plath\u2019s mother in 1975, was intended, at least in part, to counter the angry tone of The Bell Jar as well as the unflattering portrait of Plath\u2019s mother contained in that narrative. According to Janet Malcolm in the New Yorker, \u201cThe publication of Letters Home had a different effect from the one Mrs. Plath had intended, however. Instead of showing that Sylvia wasn\u2019t \u2018like that,\u2019 the letters caused the reader to consider for the first time the possibility that her sick relationship with her mother was the reason she was like that.\u201d Though Hughes exercised final editorial approval, the publication of Letters Home also cast a new and unfavorable light on numerous others linked to Plath, including Hughes himself. Malcolm wrote, \u201cBefore the publication of Letters Home, the Plath legend was brief and contained, a taut, austere stage drama set in a few bleak, sparsely furnished rooms.\u201d Plath\u2019s intimate letters to her family contain unguarded personal commentary on her college years, writing, despair, friendships, marriage, and children.\nAfter Plath\u2019s death, The It-Doesn\u2019t-Matter Suit, a book for children, was also discovered among her papers and published posthumously. The story features Max Nix, a resident of Winkelburg, who happily acquires a modest \u201cwoolly, whiskery brand-new mustard-yellow suit.\u201d Nicci Gerrard wrote in the Observer, \u201cThere\u2019s no disturbance in the world of Winkelburg: even Max\u2019s desire for a suit is as shallow and clear as the silver stream that runs like a ribbon through the valley.\u201d Despite the lasting impression of Plath\u2019s bleak art and early death, Gerrard concluded that \u201csmall pieces of happiness like this little book remind us of her life.\u201d\nPlath\u2019s relationship with Hughes has long been the subject of commentary, not always flattering to Hughes. Feminist critics in particular tended to see in Plath\u2019s suicide a repudiation of the expectations placed upon women in the early 1960s. Further criticism attended Hughes\u2019s guardianship of Plath\u2019s papers, especially when Hughes admitted that he destroyed some of Plath\u2019s journals, including several written just prior to her suicide. Materer felt that Hughes\u2019s control over Plath\u2019s papers\u2014a right he exercised only because their divorce had not become final\u2014caused \u201cdifficulties\u201d for both critics and biographers. Materer added, \u201cThe estate\u2019s strict control of copyright and its editing of such writings as Plath\u2019s journals and letters have caused the most serious problems for scholars.\u201d\nSince Hughes\u2019s death from cancer in 1998, a new edition of Plath\u2019s journals has been published, The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath, 1950-1962.This exact transcription of the poet\u2019s journals, from her earliest days at Smith College to the days of her marriage, has been published verbatim, down to her misspellings. \u201cUncritical admirers of Plath will find much here that is fascinating,\u201d noted Oates. \u201cOther readers may find much that is fascinating and repellent in equal measure.\u201d Oates concluded, \u201cLike all unedited journals, Plath\u2019s may be best read piecemeal, and rapidly, as they were written. The reader is advised to seek out the stronger, more lyric and exhilarating passages, which exist in enough abundance through these many pages to assure that this presumed final posthumous publication of Sylvia Plath\u2019s is that rarity, a genuine literary event worthy of the poet\u2019s aggressive mythopoetic claim in \u2018Lady Lazarus\u2019\u2014Out of the ash/I rise with my red hair/And I eat men like air.\u201d\nHughes once summarized Plath\u2019s unique personality and talent: \u201cHer poetry escapes ordinary analysis in the way clairvoyance and mediumship do: her psychic gifts, at almost any time, were strong enough to make her frequently wish to be rid of them. In her poetry, in other words, she had free and controlled access to depths formerly reserved to the primitive ecstatic priests, shamans and Holymen.\u201d The poet continued, \u201cSurveyed as a whole ... I think the unity of her opus is clear. Once the unity shows itself, the logic and inevitability of the language, which controls and contains such conflagrations and collisions within itself, becomes more obviously what it is\u2014direct, and even plain, speech. This language, this unique and radiant substance, is the product of an alchemy on the noblest scale. Her elements were extreme: a violent, almost demonic spirit in her, opposed a tenderness and capacity to suffer and love things infinitely, which was just as great and far more in evidence. Her stormy, luminous senses assaulted a downright practical intelligence that could probably have dealt with anything. ... She saw her world in the flame of the ultimate substance and the ultimate depth. And this is the distinction of her language, that every word is Baraka: the flame and the rose folded together. Poets have often spoken about this ideal possibility but where else, outside these poems, has it actually occurred? If we have the discrimination to answer this question, we can set her in her rightful company.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Confessional"]}}
