In a 2013 Vol.1 Brooklyn review, Tobias Carroll described The Compleat Purge as \u201ca hybrid in the best sense of the word, bridging styles to get at something deeper; volleying out a series of cloaks to get at something much more essential.\u201d In a 2013 conversation on confessional writing with Rachel Riederer, Low stated, \u201cI\u2019m more interested in thinking about the confessional as a formal space, as a genre.\u201d Tracing the rise of confessional writing to the 18th-century domestic development of small writing rooms, or \u201ccabinets,\u201d used primarily by women, and imagining the content created in those spaces, Low continued, \u201cSo maybe a way to think about the confessional would be for it to be more of a fantasy of what a private life should be or maybe even a fantasy of what a feminine private life would be.\u201d Low earned a BA at the University of Pennsylvania and an MA at New York University.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
