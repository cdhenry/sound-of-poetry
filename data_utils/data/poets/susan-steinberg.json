Though Steinberg describes her work as fiction, she is known for mixing lyric prose and verse to create startling and evocative hybrids that link thematic and narrative content with the physical form of the text. The stories in both The End of Free Love and Hydroplane are mainly coming-of-age tales that lyrically dissect the onset of maturity through a variety of experimental forms. The author of three collections of short stories, Spectacle (2013), Hydroplane (2006), and The End of Free Love (2003), Steinberg has held residencies at Yaddo, the MacDowell Colony, the Vermont Studio Center, The Wurlitzer Foundation, and the Blue Mountain Center.\u00a0Steinberg is professor of English at the University of San Francisco.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
