His father, the son of a poor shopkeeper in Glasgow, Scotland, was born in 1837\u2014the year of Victoria\u2019s coronation as Queen of England\u2014and ran away first to London and then, at the age of 18, to Chicago, Illinois. His mother was a Hillard, a family that, as Dialogues of Archibald MacLeish and Mark Van Doren reveals, MacLeish was fond of tracing back through its New England generations to Elder Brewster, the minister aboard the Mayflower. MacLeish was born in Glencoe, Illinois, attended Hotchkiss School from 1907 to 1911, and from 1911 to 1915 studied at Yale University, where he edited and wrote for the Yale Literary Magazine, contributed to the Yale Review, and composed Songs for a Summer\u2019s Day, a sonnet sequence that was chosen as the University\u2019s Prize Poem in 1915. MacLeish married Ada Hitchcock in 1916. Two years later he saw service in France and published his first collection of poems, Tower of Ivory (1917).\nMacLeish viewed World War I as the ending of an old world and the beginning of a new one that was sensed rather than understood. His early poetry was his attempt to understand this new world; MacLeish would later say that his education regarding this world began not in his undergraduate years at Yale, but in years after the war at Harvard Law School. As he declared in Riders on the Earth: Essays and Recollections (1978), Harvard sparked in him a sense of the human tradition, \u201cthe vision of mental time, of the interminable journey of the human mind, the great tradition of the intellectual past which knows the bearings of the future.\u201d\nMacLeish\u2019s personal dilemma, and the constant theme of his early writings, was the reconciliation of idealism with reality. This theme had run through his undergraduate short stories and through his first long poem, \u201cOur Lady of Troy,\u201d which was published in Tower of Ivory. In his own life, he resolved this dilemma by turning from his promising career as a lawyer to pursue the vocation for which the law courts had left him little time\u2014that of poet. In the summer of 1923, MacLeish announced his commitment to poetry by moving from Boston with his wife and two children, into a fourth-floor flat on the Boulevard St. Michel in Paris, France.\nThe first major period of MacLeish\u2019s poetic career\u2014some would say the only major one\u2014thus began in the early 1920s, when he gave up the law and moved abroad, and closed in the later 1930s, when he took on a succession of \u201cpublic\u201d obligations. During these years, MacLeish\u2019s work was made up of nine longer poems or sequences of poems, accompanied by lyric meditations and statements in various forms on diverse but characteristic themes: doubt, loss, alienation, art, aging, the quest. The shorter poems, some of them very successful, have by anthologizing and other emphases become better known than the longer ones. MacLeish\u2019s collection, New and Collected Poems, 1917\u20131984, however, emphasizes the interrelation of his longer and shorter poems, as did his first major collection, Poems, 1924\u20131933.\nThe \u201cother poems\u201d of 1924\u2019s The Happy Marriage, and Other Poems, still late Victorian prentice-work, are often reminiscent of Edwin Arlington Robinson\u2014whom MacLeish admired\u2014and are justly forgotten. But the title poem, with its more complex, more contemporary subject, alternates skilled imitation of major predecessors with accents of personal authority. It could even be argued that this mixed transitional style fits, if only by chance, the protagonist\u2019s own confusion between trite attitudes and existential authenticity. By Part Four of The Happy Marriage, the protagonist\u2019s recognition of marital reality has found its poetic voice, what Grover Smith called in Archibald MacLeish \u201cconscious symbolism; witty, almost metaphysical strategies of argument; compressed and intense implications.\u201d\nThe Pot of Earth tells the very different story of a very different figure, a young woman deeply affected psychologically or culturally by archetypal myths of woman\u2019s fertility and its transformative powers as seen through \u201cthe figure of the dying god whose imaginative presence is at the core of cultural vitality,\u201d according to John B. Vickery in The Literary Impact of the Golden Bough. Obsessed by symbolic mythical images\u2014excessively so in the unrevised version\u2014she dies in childbirth, sought by or seeking a death dictated by myth, the unconscious, or simple biology. To tell her moving story, MacLeish interweaves narrative and lyric forms, regular and irregular verse of great eloquence that reinforces the pathos, irony, and mystery of her fate.\nBesides marking the first publication of Einstein, 1926\u2019s Streets in the Moon has some of MacLeish\u2019s best and best-known shorter poems. In \u201cMemorial Rain\u201d (directly) and in \u201cThe Silent Slain\u201d (indirectly) MacLeish came to what terms he could with concerns identified in Paul Fussell\u2019s The Great War and Modern Memory. \u201cThe Farm\u201d illustrates the search for New England roots that ran through MacLeish\u2019s career and his writings in prose and verse. Other poems reflect the varying expatriate moods that came together after a few years in \u201cAmerican Letter.\u201d And the well-known, too often misunderstood \u201cArs Poetica\u201d conveys in its images, imitative form, and self-contradictions MacLeish\u2019s permanent conviction that a poem should both mean and be.\nIn Einstein, published separately in 1929, MacLeish presented a day\u2019s meditation that recapitulates the major stages in Einstein\u2019s physical and metaphysical struggle to contain and comprehend the physical universe, from classical empiricism through romantic empathy to modern, introspective, analytic physics. In flexible, elaborate, evocative blank verse, with an epigrammatic literal/allegorical prose gloss, and in a rich texture of spatial imagery the poem \u201cnarrates\u201d Einstein\u2019s quest for knowledge. To Frederick J. Hoffman in The Twenties, this quest is shown as \u201cpathetic and futile,\u201d but to Lauriat Lane Jr., in an Ariel essay, it is \u201cpotentially tragic\u201d and an example of \u201cmodern, existential Man Thinking.\u201d\nCiting The Hamlet of A. MacLeish, Leslie Fiedler in Unfinished Business identified four appeals of the story of Hamlet to the American imagination: 1) \u201canguish and melancholy,\u201d 2) \u201cthe notion of suicide,\u201d 3) \u201cthe inhibitory nature of conscience,\u201d and 4) \u201can oddly apt parable of our relationship to Europe.\u201d This poem, MacLeish\u2019s most complex and elaborate, addresses all four subjects. Combining and contrasting what Fiedler elsewhere called signature and archetype, autobiography and myth, the work, which contains fourteen sections and a Shakespearean gloss, juxtaposes dialectically Hamlet, MacLeish\u2019s personal and poetic autobiographical uncertainties, and two fulfilled quests\u2014a medieval Grail romance and tribal migrations out of the Anabase of Saint-John Perse, whose fulfillment only intensifies the doubts and despairs of Hamlet/MacLeish. As he recorded in A Reviewer\u2019s ABC, Conrad Aiken, who had found Einstein \u201ca long poem which any living poet might envy, as rich in thought as it is in color and movement,\u201d labeled The Hamlet of A. MacLeish \u201ca kind of brilliant pastiche,\u201d although \u201cfull of beautiful things.\u201d Aiken went on, however, to pose the unanswered question of \u201cwhether [MacLeish\u2019s] \u2018echoes\u2019 might not, by a future generation, be actually preferred to the things they echo.\u201d Often, in MacLeish\u2019s work, such \u201cechoes\u201d are a form of brilliant, purposeful parody, an additional stylistic power finally recognizable 50 postmodern years later for what it is.\nAs its title implies, MacLeish published New Found Land after he had returned to America for good. Less varied and experimental in form than the short poems of Streets in the Moon (1926), the poems in the slender New Found Land (1930) share the moods and concerns of The Hamlet of A. MacLeish. Along with \u201cAmerican Letter,\u201d the book has one of MacLeish\u2019s most famous \u201cinternational\u201d poems, \u201cYou, Andrew Marvell,\u201d and one of his greatest regional ones, \u201cImmortal Autumn.\u201d For Signi Falk in Archibald MacLeish, New Found Land reveals \u201ca poet torn between the old world and the new.\u201d\nConquistador (1932), too, combines the old world and the new, but by the year of the book\u2019s publication, the choice had become clear if often tragic in its outcome. In the conquerors of Central American native civilization MacLeish found a romantic, exotic history that could also serve as a myth, a metaphor, for closer, more familiar history and concerns. In Montezuma, Cortez, and Diaz, the poem offers three figures\u2014god, hero, and man\u2014who share the reader\u2019s attention and good will and who are examined in an ironic context of human blood and natural beauty, greed for gold and sun-worship, political intrigue and heroic quest. Seeing the poem wholly through its narrator, Diaz, Allen Tate praised the poem for its \u201cfinely sustained tone,\u201d its \u201cclarity of sensuous reminiscence,\u201d and its \u201ctechnical perfection,\u201d but found in its sentimentality \u201cone of the examples of our modern sensibility at its best; it has the defect of its qualities,\u201d as Tate recorded in Essays of Four Decades.\nIn their many interrelations, The Pot of Earth, Einstein, The Hamlet of A. MacLeish, and Conquistador form a tetralogy of four major high modernist poems. With \u201cElpenor\u201d\u2014originally \u201c1933\u201d\u2014which appeared in Poems, 1924\u20131933 and which has subsequently been republished under each title, MacLeish moved toward the \u201cpublic speech\u201d of the post-Depression, Rooseveltian 1930s. Both a vivid retelling and sequel to Homer and Dante, this compressed little epic populates a modern Hell in the manner of Ezra Pound\u2019s poetry and points \u201cthe way on,\u201d in MacLeish\u2019s characteristic symbolic topographical imagery, where its readers can \u201cbegin it again: start over.\u201d\nAmong the other new poems in Poems, 1924\u20131933, \u201cFrescoes for Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s City\u201d (also published separately in 1933) dealt with a public controversy and caused additional public excitement. Although praised by Cleanth Brooks in Modern Poetry and the Tradition, it has \u201cnot only ideological but functional problems,\u201d as Grover Smith declared; and some of its sections, like several of MacLeish\u2019s other public poems of the 1930s, reveal \u201cthe absence of arresting images and the slackness of the rhythm\u201d that troubled David Luytens in The Creative Encounter. However, as recorded in Literary Opinion in America, Morton D. Zabel also found in these public poems \u201ca signal of profitable intentions\u201d and discovered \u201ca very moving beauty\u201d in the very unpublic set of lyrics, \u201cThe Woman on the Stair,\u201d in Public Speech.\nThe last of MacLeish\u2019s longer poems of the 1930s was America Was Promises. In an essay collected in A Poet\u2019s Alphabet, Louise Bogan attacked it as \u201cMacLeish\u2019s saddest and most conglomerate attempt at \u2018public speech\u2019s\u2019 to date \u2026 political poetry, even a kind of official poetry,\u201d but Grover Smith later reassessed it as \u201cthe most eloquent of the \u2018public\u2019 poems \u2026 much better as a poem than as a message: for once, MacLeish\u2019s adaptation of St.-J. Perse\u2019s geographic evocations seems precisely right.\u201d America Was Promises combines such \u201cgeographic evocations\u201d with a quasi-allegorical, populist history of Jefferson and Man, Adams and the Aristocracy, Paine and the People. For The Human Season: Selected Poems, 1926\u20131972 MacLeish cut from America Was Promises almost all its \u201cofficial\u201d poetry and possibly made it a much better poem.\nLooking back over these first two decades of MacLeish\u2019s poetry, Karl Shapiro declared in Essay on Rime \u201ca special speech is born / Out of this searching, something absolute, \u2026 a linguistic dream \u2026 an influential dialect.\u201d In this poetry, said Hyatt H. Waggoner in The Heel of Elohim, \u201cThe will to believe is certainly present, but so also are the vacant lights, the bright void, the listening, idiot silence\u201d; yet in North American Review, Mason Wade saw in the same poetry a \u201cmoving \u2026 intellectual anabasis,\u201d and in Sewanee Review Reed Whittemore praised some of it as \u201cDemocratic Pastoral.\u201d\nIn 1924 The Happy Marriage had explored the idea that out of the union of the ideal and the real must emerge a more mature sense of individual identity. This same theme carried through MacLeish\u2019s 1926 poetic drama, Nobodaddy, a verse play that uses the Adam and Eve story as \u201cthe dramatic situation which the condition of self-consciousness in an indifferent universe seems to me to present.\u201d MacLeish would affirm, a few years later, that the poet\u2019s role was \u201cthe restoration of man to his position of dignity and responsibility at the centre of his world.\u201d Nobodaddy provided its author with the opportunity to return to humankind\u2019s origins, to explore the human condition in terms of its myths and mysteries. To MacLeish, the work was a simple and forthright play of the beginnings of human consciousness.\nIn the resolution of his own sense of self-consciousness, symbolized by his move to Paris in 1923, MacLeish showed a certain kinship with his character Cain. Both had found the strength necessary to sever\u2014in Cain\u2019s words\u2014the thick vein \u201cthat knots me to the body of the earth,\u201d and to grab control of the centers of their own worlds. Nobodaddy is the story of humankind attempting to make sense of the chaos of its life. It can also be read as the apologia for its author. And its theme of a world in which humankind is bewildered and bored, a world in which its knowledge is not matched by its understanding, is one that would run through much of MacLeish\u2019s writing during the 1920s.\nWhen MacLeish returned from Europe in 1928 and settled in Conway, Massachusetts, he had obviously \u201cre-viewed\u201d America. The country\u2019s idealism, reflected especially in the philosophies of its founders, supplied him with a sense of identity and place that existential angst had failed to engender. The questor had reached this personal goal only to find the obvious truth that each goal is a new beginning and that his search had been only his initiation into what would be a lengthy continuing journey. While the writer was now set to move in new directions, George Dangerfield asserted in a 1931 Books essay that \u201cif [MacLeish] were never to write another word, he would still be a poet of definite importance.\u201d\nMacLeish\u2019s first produced stage play, Panic: A Play in Verse (1935), is a variation on the Cain story set against the background of the American Depression and a generation of capitalists he felt were in the process of leaving capitalism \u201cintellectually defenseless and unarmed.\u201d The conflict of the play is between the will of a man (McGafferty, played in the original production by Orson Welles) and a fatalistic concept of human life (dialectical materialism). McGafferty surrenders to the delphic oracle of Marxist determinism and thus falls victim to it. As the Blind Man in the play observes, the financier fails because (unlike Cain) he will not trust his own freedom.\nThe play was MacLeish\u2019s attempt to comprehend the real sense of panic in a country where individualism had turned into individual greed and freedom had been replaced by a failing \u201cfree enterprise.\u201d US communists found the play particularly frustrating, as MacLeish (who was on the editorial board of Fortune) refused to view what they took to be the imminence and inevitability of the Marxist revolution as anything more than a delphic prophecy that the crowd chorus was free to reject. Various other reviews of the production centered on the poet\u2019s attempt to create a verse line for the modern stage. Malcolm Cowley declared in a 1935 New Republic assessment that the play brought \u201ca new intelligence to the theatre and [embodied] the results of the experiments made by modern poets.\u201d\nIn the late 1930s, speaking with the \u201cpublic voice\u201d that characterized his writings from the beginning of the decade, MacLeish wrote two verse plays for radio: The Fall of the City, broadcast in April, 1937, and Air Raid, broadcast in October, 1938. The first of these was the poet\u2019s exploration of his sense of a developing worldwide change in the commitment of human consciousness to human freedom. It was a change that MacLeish\u2019s own hero and friend, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, had addressed at his first inauguration: \u201cWe have nothing to fear but fear itself.\u201d Air Raid grew out of the German bombing of Guernica and Pablo Picasso\u2019s response to that slaughter through his painting, \u201cGuernica.\u201d Air Raid is a play for voices dealing with the changes in the nature of war and with the alterations in the human spirit that had permitted such changes. MacLeish intended neither script to be primarily a political statement; he looked upon both as poems, as creations that explored what he perceived to be these changes rather than as attempts to persuade. Still, the closeness of MacLeish\u2019s sympathies to Roosevelt\u2019s has led Luytens to call MacLeish \u201cthe poet laureate of the New Deal.\u201d\nThe Trojan Horse, a verse drama first presented on the BBC in 1952, is in many ways a return to earlier decades and earlier characters. Helen of Troy had been earlier seen in a closet drama titled Our Lady of Troy and collected in MacLeish\u2019s Tower of Ivory. She had later appeared in The Happy Marriage as the symbol of Beauty. The Blind Man, who earlier laid the future before McGafferty in Panic, has the same function here. Paul Brooks, in a note accompanying the first edition of The Trojan Horse, tied the play to the McCarthy era, but the script was intended more generally to explore in myth the sense of deception the poet had perceived in his own century. The poetic sense of awareness itself is presented in a 1953 play, This Music Crept by Me upon the Waters, where Elizabeth, as did Cain before her, experiences the discovery of her own place in the cosmos.\nThe public voice that found its way into MacLeish\u2019s poetry in the 1930s was a reflection of the sense of public responsibility he had come to accept on his return from Paris. Harriet Monroe in a 1931 issue of Poetry, wrote that she has \u201cmuch faith in the ability of this poet to interpret his age: he has the thinking mind, the creative imagination, the artistic equipment of beautiful words and rhythms.\u201d This voice was heard most directly in the many articles and speeches MacLeish wrote on the role of the poet and, through the political chaos of the western world in the 1930s and 1940s, on the direction he felt America should be pursuing. Much of this material has been collected in A Time to Speak (1941), A Time to Act (1943), and A Continuing Journey (1968). Also, as Falk points out, MacLeish committed himself to such public offices as Librarian of Congress from 1939 to 1944, assistant director of the Office of War Information in 1942, Assistant Secretary of State from 1944 to 1945, and chair of the US delegation to the founding conference of UNESCO in 1945.\nMacLeish said several times that in the long poem \u201cActfive,\u201d published in Actfive and Other Poems in 1948, he tried to come to terms with his and the world\u2019s experiences in the immediately preceding years: the challenge and suffering of World War II, the opportunities and failures of the peace, the loss of so many faiths. Conquistador had offered an implicit choice between god, hero, and man; \u201cActfive,\u201d in its three scenes, redefines and makes that choice. With the God gone, the King dethroned, and Man murdered\u2014all in elegiac, characteristically despairing lines\u2014the heroes of the age are then thrust forward in their emptiness through sardonically abrupt rhythms. They give way, in turn, to \u201cthe shapes of flesh and bone,\u201d in whose moving, subtly musical, indirect voices MacLeish\u2019s long involvement with Matthew Arnold is fulfilled. The result is a poetic affirmation, \u201chumanist and existentialist,\u201d according to Luytens, for an even darker, more confused, post-Arnoldian time.\n\u201cActfive\u201d was MacLeish\u2019s last poem to interweave lyric statement and emblematically condensed narrative within an extended structure of feeling and idea. In the period from 1944 to 1954, called by Grover Smith \u201chis second renaissance,\u201d he published over 80 short poems, half of them, apparently, written in two very creative years after he began teaching poetry at Harvard, where he was Boylsten Professor from 1949 to 1962. In style these poems, having many forms and treating a great variety of subjects, might be called neo-modernist, embodying a riper, wiser Imagism, for example. But their combination of immediate, personal concern with impersonal form, image, and language is not easily labeled. Poets Hayden Carruth in Effluences from the Sacred Cave, Richard Eberhart in Virginia Quarterly Review, John Ciardi in Atlantic, and Kimon Friar in New Republic have all praised these poems.\nThe best of these short works succeed, not surprisingly, in the terms of MacLeish\u2019s Poetry and Experience, which defines the \u201cmeans\u201d by which and the \u201cshapes\u201d in which poetry finds its \u201cend\u201d meaning. In brief, MacLeish contended, poetry combines sounds, signs, images, and metaphor to give meaning to the private world (Emily Dickinson), the public world (William Butler Yeats), the anti-world (Arthur Rimbaud), and the arable world (John Keats).\nAmong the lyrics of the private world, which record recognizable and therefore meaningful experience spoken in a living, personal voice, are such fine love poems as \u201cEver Since,\u201d \u201cCalypso\u2019s Island,\u201d \u201cWhat Any Lover Learns,\u201d and such testaments of poetic and humanist faith as \u201cA Man\u2019s Work,\u201d \u201cThe Two Priests,\u201d \u201cThe Infinite Reason,\u201d and \u201cReasons for Music,\u201d some of which also look outward to the public world. MacLeish\u2019s poetic statements of and for the world of public affairs are designed both \u201cto lash out\u201d and to try to \u201cmake positive sense of the public world,\u201d as he asserted in Poetry and Experience. \u201cBrave New World,\u201d for example, \u201clashes out\u201d in tight, cutting quatrains at the loss of Jefferson\u2019s vision of human freedom. \u201cThe Danger in the Air\u201d and \u201cThe Sheep in the Ruins\u201c move meditatively toward making some sense against the danger, amid the ruins. Very few of these short poems look toward Rimbaud\u2019s anti-world. For MacLeish, as for Rimbaud, the sea was the great image of the Unknown: over the sea in \u201cVoyage West,\u201d beneath it in \u201cThe Reef Fisher.\u201d MacLeish declared in Poetry and Experience that \u201cRimbaud\u2019s anti-world was not a rejection of the possibility of the world\u201d; nor were MacLeish\u2019s own few visions of that anti-world. Poems of the arable world try to make familiar yet tragic \u201ctruth of the passing-away of the world.\u201d In his Dialogues with Mark Van Doren, MacLeish testified how much the arable world of Uphill Farm in Massachusetts meant to him, as did \u201cThe Two Trees,\u201d \u201cThe Snow Fall,\u201d and \u201cThe Old Men in the Leaf Smoke.\u201d From Caribbean Antigua, on the other hand, probably came \u201cThe Old Man to the Lizard\u201d and \u201cVicissitudes of the Creator.\u201d And the truth of the passing-away of the world took another, more direct, even more moving form in \u201cFor the Anniversary of My Mother\u2019s Death\u201d and \u201cMy Naked Aunt.\u201d\nSeveral volumes of MacLeish\u2019s prose\u2014Poetry and Experience (1960), a section of A Continuing Journey (1968), and Poetry and Opinion: The Pisan Cantos of Ezra Pound (1950), on the controversy surrounding Ezra Pound\u2019s support for Mussolini during World War II\u2014grew out of his teaching. His two earliest collections of literary and political statements were A Time to Speak and A Time to Act\u2014\u201ca couple of books of speeches,\u201d as he labeled them in Letters of Archibald MacLeish, 1907 to 1982. Some of these prose pieces, most notoriously \u201cThe Irresponsibles,\u201d strayed dangerously close to propaganda\u2014admittedly in a time of great public danger\u2014and were attacked for this failing by critics like Edmund Wilson in Classics and Commercials and Morton D. Zabel in Partisan Review. In still another vein, Champion of a Cause: Essays and Addresses on Librarianship reprinted MacLeish\u2019s deliberately nonprofessional, nontechnical \u201cessays and addresses on librarianship.\u201d\nMacLeish\u2019s prose, for the most part, bore public witness to familiar but important ideas and beliefs. The editors of Ten Contemporary Thinkers included four MacLeish essays that represent well the range of his prose: \u201cThe Writer and Revolution,\u201d \u201cHumanism and the Belief in Man,\u201d \u201cThe Conquest of America,\u201d and \u201cThe Isolation of the American Artist;\u201d his essays and books specifically on poetry and poets eloquently and even more significantly witness to the broadly defined powers of poems to move their readers. And even the most topical of MacLeish\u2019s political essays keep their relevance. In 1949 he first published \u201cThe Conquest of America\u201d on the dangers of mindless anti-Communism and failure to reaffirm the American \u201crevolution of the individual.\u201d In 1980 the Atlantic felt obliged by events to reprint MacLeish\u2019s warning. To the end of his long life he continued, in prose and in poetry, to praise and to warn \u201cthe Republic.\u201d\nHaving left public life and moved to Harvard by the late 1940s, MacLeish refocused his attention from the social and political themes of the preceding two decades toward an earlier poetic interest: the place and value of man in the universe. In his longer postwar poetic works, he followed his own exhortation to invent the metaphor for the age. His series of poems collected as Songs for Eve returned again to the setting of Nobodaddy to emphasize once more the fundamental importance of self-consciousness in an indifferent universe. Despite his various attempts to find in Adam and Eve the metaphor for the age, the poet\u2019s most successful image of the human spirit appeared four years later on the stage of New York\u2019s ANTA Theatre in the character of J.B. J.B.\u2019s structure, in the acting edition of the play, differs substantially from the original version published by Houghton Mifflin in 1958, but the main characters remain basically the same. J.B. comes across both the footlights and the page not as a character in a morality play\u2014for the play, despite its early scenes, is not a morality play\u2014but as a flesh-and-blood common man beset by sufferings to which all flesh is heir. And in J.B.\u2019s struggle and success against an inexplicable, brutal, and unjust universe, MacLeish presented what he hoped would be the metaphor for humankind\u2019s next era. Like Job, J.B. is not answered, yet his love for Sarah affirms, in the playwrights phrase, \u201cthe worth of life in spite of life.\u201d That worth is found in a love that paradoxically answers nothing but \u201cbecomes the ultimate human answer to the ultimate human question.\u201d\nAfter receiving a Pulitzer Prize, his third, for J.B. (1958), MacLeish returned to man\u2019s quarrels with the gods in Herakles, first produced in 1965 and published in 1967. During the first part of the play, Professor Hoadley is drawn to Greece, the patria of the intellectual life, in search of the spirit of Herakles, the half-man, half-god who dared to struggle with the unanswered questions of the universe. Balancing Hoadley\u2019s search for intellectual perfection is his wife\u2019s conviction that life is a concrete reality including the human imperfection her husband would transcend. In the second half of the play, a frustrated Herakles fails to receive a sign from Apollo and angrily ascends to the temple door threatening to answer his own oracle. But, despite the merits of his deeds, he is unable to perform the god-like act of pronouncing his own destiny. In the end, Hoadley\u2019s wife and Herakles\u2019s Megara refocus the human spirit where J.B. had earlier found it\u2014on the day-to-day occupation of living, not in glorious myth, but in concrete reality.\nIf J.B. and Herakles raise still-unanswered questions, they also affirm that all questions need not be answered. MacLeish\u2019s last full-length play, Scratch (1971), finds its source in \u201cThe Devil and Daniel Webster,\u201d Stephen Vincent Benet\u2019s treatment of the mythical American confrontation between man and the Devil. Alone of the final three plays, it explores questions that, because of their American roots, could move closer to resolution within the text. MacLeish felt there were three reasons that Benet\u2019s story had widened into myth: that the Republic had become full of men and women who had sold their souls \u201cfor its comforts and amenities\u201d; that \u201cbelief in hell was reviving everywhere and that, if only love of life could be turned into contempt for living, hope into despair, the entire planet would dissolve into that cistern of self-pity where [Samuel Beckett\u2019s] Godot never comes\u201d; and that Daniel Webster\u2019s concern for Liberty and Union, or freedom and government, was as contemporary as it had ever been.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, MacLeish also wrote three shorter scripts: a highly polemical television play, The Secret of Freedom (1960); an \u201coutdoor play\u201d for the bicentennial of Conway titled An Evening\u2019s Journey to Conway, Massachusetts (1967); and The Great American Fourth of July Parade (1975), a verse play for radio. All three works reflect their author\u2019s continual concern for the central values of America\u2019s founders, as does his dramatic monologue, \u201cNight Watch in the City of Boston.\u201d\nMacLeish would grant a series of interviews between 1976 and 1981 that he considered an accurate reflection of his life as a poet. Published as Archibald MacLeish: Reflections in 1986, these interviews portray a writer who was, in the words of Choice reviewer J. Overmyer, \u201cmeticulous about the truth, outspoken, and delightful.\u201d Full of details about his stay in Paris, his management of the Library of Congress, his law and teaching experiences, and including many reminiscences of family and friends, MacLeish initiated the interviews, which were given to Bernard A. Drabeck and Helen Ellis, teachers from a community college near the aged poet\u2019s Massachusetts home. While noting that MacLeish\u2019s descriptions of his involvement in Washington politics contained \u201cdramatic moments,\u201d William Pratt commented in World Literature Today that \u201cnothing reverberated in his memory with the passion of Paris in the twenties, the time when he found himself as a poet and the foundation on which the rest of his distinguished public career was built.\u201d Characterizing Reflections as \u201ca gifted writer\u2019s purely spoken autobiography,\u201d New York Times Book Review critic Robert Gorham Davis maintained that \u201cIn this genial, relaxed book we have a golden view of the candidly retrospective statesman-poet in his old age as he really was, with most pretension and all rhetoric abandoned.\u201d\nRetiring from public life during his last decades, MacLeish became not so much an elder statesman as an elder of various churches: the churches of friendship, of patriotism, of poetry, of love, of death. His talks, interviews, letters, essays, and poems, and his parable-play for radio, The Great American Fourth of July Parade, all voice the recurring, autumnal concerns of \u201cthe human season\u201d in a quiet, personal, \u201celderly\u201d voice. Almost 90 years old, MacLeish died on April 20, 1982, the day after Patriot\u2019s Day.\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
