He earned a BA at Yale University, where he was awarded the Frederick Mortimer Clapp Fellowship.\nWarren\u2019s debut poetry collection, The Destroyer in the Glass (2016), was chosen by Carl Phillips for the Yale Series of Younger Poets. Praising the collection\u2019s \u201cwedding of intellect, heart, sly humor, and formal dexterity, all in the service of negotiating those moments when an impulse toward communion with others competes with an instinct for a more isolated self\u201d in his judge\u2019s citation, Phillips observes, \u201cThe poems both examine and embody the nexus of joy and sorrow, of certainty and confusion, without which there\u2019d be none of the restlessness that makes us uniquely human.\u201d\nWarren is currently pursuing a PhD in English at the University of California, Berkeley.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
