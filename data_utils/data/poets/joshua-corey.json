Influenced by Charles Olson, Wallace Stevens, and Robert Duncan, Corey pushes formal structure toward fracture, engaging themes of failure, desire, and the pastoral. In a review of Severance Songs for Poetry Northwest, poet Zach Savich observed that Corey\u2019s poems \u201care sonnet-like less for their containers than for the bright shapes they contain. The sense of a sonnet, these poems suggest, isn\u2019t in formal configuration but in a manner of speaking, of talking to oneself, of talking things through. In Severance Songs, this manner reels through landscape to render the \u2018pool of newsworthy airs\u2019 that \u2018surrounds my perception.\u2019\u201d In a 2012 interview with Stephen Ross for Wave Composition, Corey stated, \u201cMore and more, what interests me about poems is the intensity of the desire they manifest: I think the reason I gravitate toward pastoral rather than ecopoetics proper is because pastoral manifests a zone in which contradictory intensities work themselves out: it\u2019s a ground for fantasy, it\u2019s Robert Duncan\u2019s meadow of first permission. \u2026 The poem can and should include everything, including everything political, but it doesn\u2019t need to orient toward critique or action\u2014and how foolish if it did, there\u2019s a million better ways to perform critique or take political action than by writing a poem. Still, our politics is spun out of what we can imagine, so poems that imagine new modes of being\u2014with others and with the others in the self\u2014may have, indirectly, a good deal of political work to do.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nCorey is the author of several poetry collections, including The Barons (2014); Dorset Prize\u2013winner Severance Songs (2011); Fourier Series (2005), which won a Fitzpatrick-O\u2019Dinn Award; Selah (2003); and the novel Beautiful Soul: An American Elegy (2014). With G.C. Waldrep, Corey edited the anthology The Arcadia Project: North American Postmodern Pastoral (2012). He is also author of\u00a0Partisan of Things (Kenning Editions, 2016), a translation of the prose poems of Francis Ponge.\r\n\u00a0\r\nCorey\u2019s honors include a Wallace Stegner Fellowship at Stanford University and a term as poet-in-residence at the University of Illinois. The Gustav E. Beerly Jr. Endowed Assistant Professor at Lake Forest College from 2010 to 2013, Corey has also served as chair of the school\u2019s Print and Digital Publishing Program. He lives with his family in Evanston, Illinois.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
