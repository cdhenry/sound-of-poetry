Influenced by Emily Dickinson and Robert Creeley, Rehm composes spare, precise poems that explore the intersections between spirit and language, and humans and the natural world.

With Juliana Spahr, Mark Wallace, and Kristin Prevallet, she edited the anthology A Poetics of Criticism (1994). \u00a0 Rehm was a founding editor of the now-defunct literary journal apex of the M.
