She earned her MA at the University of Hawai\u02bbi. Her poetry, in her words, \u201cmainly focuses on raising awareness surrounding the issues and threats faced by my people. Nuclear testing conducted in our islands, militarism, the rising sea level as a result of climate change, forced migration, adaptation and racism in America\u2014these are just a few themes my poetry touches upon. \u2026 I also use poetry as a means of understanding the people and the world around me.\u201d In 2014, Jetnil-Kijiner was chosen to address the UN Climate Summit in New York City. Her poem \u201cDear Matafele Peinem\u201d was written to her daughter and articulated the threats climate change and corporate power pose to the Marshall Islands, as well as the resilience of the Marshallese.\u00a0\nWith her cousins, Jetnil-Kijiner founded the community group Jodrikdrik in Jipan ene eo e Kutok Maroro (Youth for a Greener Environment).
