Over the course of her long career, Eavan Boland emerged as one of the foremost female voices in Irish literature. Throughout her many collections of poetry, in her prose memoir\u00a0Object Lessons\u00a0(1995), and in her work as a noted anthologist and teacher, Boland honed an appreciation for the ordinary in life. The poet and critic Ruth Padel described Boland\u2019s \u201ccommitment to lyric grace and feminism\u201d even as her subjects tend to \u201cthe fabric of domestic life, myth, love, history, and Irish rural landscape.\u201d Keenly aware of the problematic associations and troubled place that women hold in Irish culture and history, Boland always wrote out of an urge to make an honest account of female experience.\nThe daughter of a diplomat and a painter, Boland spent her girlhood in London and New York, returning to Ireland to attend secondary school in Killiney and later university at Trinity College in Dublin. Though still a student when she published her first collection,\u00a023 Poems\u00a0(1962), Boland\u2019s early work was informed by her experiences as a young wife and mother, and her growing awareness of the troubled role of women in Irish history and culture.\nIn an interview with readers on the website\u00a0A Smartish Pace, Boland herself described the \u201cdifficult situation\u201d of her early years as a poet: \u201cI began to write in an Ireland where the word \u2018woman\u2019 and the word \u2018poet\u2019 seemed to be in some sort of magnetic opposition to each other. Ireland was a country with a compelling past, and the word \u2018woman\u2019 invoked all kinds of images of communality which were thought to be contrary to the life of anarchic individualism invoked by the word \u2018poet\u2019 \u2026 I wanted to put the life I lived into the poem I wrote. And the life I lived was a woman\u2019s life. And I couldn\u2019t accept the possibility that the life of the woman would not, or could not, be named in the poetry of my own nation.\u201d\nBoland\u2019s poetry is known for subverting traditional constructions of womanhood, as well as offering fresh perspectives on Irish history and mythology. Her fifth book,\u00a0In Her Own Image\u00a0(1980), brought Boland international recognition and acclaim. Exploring topics such as domestic violence, anorexia, infanticide, and cancer, the book also announced Boland\u2019s ongoing concern with inaccurate and muffled portrayals of women in Irish literature and society. Her next books, including\u00a0Night Feed\u00a0(1982) and her first volume of selected poems\u00a0Outside History\u00a0(1990), continued to explore questions of female identity. Hers is a voice, in the words of Melanie Rehak in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review, \u201cthat is by now famous for its unwavering feminism as well as its devotion to both the joys of domesticity and her native Ireland.\u201d In a Time of Violence\u00a0(1994), shortlisted for the prestigious T.S. Eliot Prize, contains poems that gesture toward private and political realities at once. In poems such as \u201cThat the Science of Cartography is Limited\u201d and \u201cAnna Liffey,\u201d Boland constructs a world that is influenced by history, the present day, and mythology and yet remains intensely personal. It is a recipe that Boland perfected in her work since.\nAgainst Love Poetry\u00a0(2001), published as\u00a0Code\u00a0in the UK,\u00a0displays the scope of Boland\u2019s knowledge and her awareness of tradition. \u201cSo much of European love poetry,\u201d she told Alice Quinn in the\u00a0New Yorker, \u201cis court poetry, coming out of the glamorous traditions of the court \u2026 There\u2019s little about the ordinariness of love.\u201d Seeking a poetry that would express the beauty of the plain things that make up most people\u2019s existences, she found that she would have to create it for herself. It is \u201cdailiness,\u201d as Boland called it, that reviewers often find, and praise, in Boland\u2019s poetry. By focusing on \u201cdailiness,\u201d Boland attempted to delineate the contours of a new vision of history. Reviewing\u00a0Code\u00a0for the\u00a0Times Literary Supplement, Clare Wills noted that \u201cBoland is a master at reading history in the configurations of landscape, at seeing space as the registration of time. If only we know how to look, there are means of deciphering the hidden, fragmentary messages from the past, of recovering lives from history\u2019s enigmatic scramblings.\u201d Domestic Violence\u00a0(2007) weaves different and competing kinds of history\u2014the national, the personal, the domestic\u2014together in poems that also meditate on the legacy of Irish poetry itself. In\u00a0Poetry Review,\u00a0Jay Parini noted: \u201cThe literal site of these poems is often Ireland itself, with its heroic gestures, high rhetoric, and (sometimes pretentious) symbol-making held in abeyance, even fended off. Boland brilliantly attacks, and nullifies, this tradition.\u201d Parini added that \u201cBoland is, in her quiet way, as melodramatic as any of her forbears. This is always what I have liked about her, the clash of intention and manifestation.\u201d\nBoland\u2019s New Collected Poems (2008) was published to glowing reviews. Incorporating numerous poems from her first books, as well as a previously-unpublished verse play, the book demonstrates Boland\u2019s restless and incessant attempt to escape from, or at the very least complicate, the Irish lyric tradition she inherited. Anne Fogarty, in the\u00a0Irish Book Review,\u00a0declared\u00a0New Collected Poems \u201cacts as a timely reminder of the significance and innovatory force of Boland\u2019s achievement as a poet and of the degree to which so many of her texts \u2026 have lastingly altered the contours of Irish writing. Modern Irish poetry would be unthinkable without her presence.\u00a0New Collected Poems\u00a0valuably updates the record of Eavan Boland\u2019s artistic output. More vitally, it underscores the vibrancy of her ongoing project as a poet who is doubtless one of the foremost writers in contemporary Ireland.\u201d\nBoland\u2019s later books include the poetry collections A Poet\u2019s Dublin\u00a0(2014) and A Woman Without a Country\u00a0(2014). Her awards include a Lannan Foundation Award in Poetry and an American Ireland Fund Literary Award. She taught at Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin, Bowdoin College, and at Stanford University since 1996, where she was the Bella Mabury and Eloise Mabury Knapp Professor in the Humanities and Melvin and Bill Lane professor of English and director of the creative writing program. She divided her time between Palo Alto and Dublin, before her death in 2020.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Ireland & Northern Ireland"]}}
