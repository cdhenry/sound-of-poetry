In 2017, she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.\n\r\nPoet Susan Settlemyre Williams, reviewing Circle for the online journal blackbird, commented on the collection: \"It frequently brings Randall Jarrell to mind, both in its wide range of subjects, including art, film, and history, in its many dramatic monologues, and particularly in its fundamental inquiry into the slippery nature of identity.\"\u009d She noted the presence of characters in liminal states and women struggling with restrictive roles, observing that Chang's \"rueful wit and sense of irony undercut any sense of self-righteousness.\"\u009d\u00a0\n\r\nChang is the editor of the anthology Asian American Poetry: The Next Generation (2004).\u00a0In addition to editing, she writes children's books and teaches in Antioch University\u2019s MFA program.
