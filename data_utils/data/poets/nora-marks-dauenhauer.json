As a member of the Tlingit tribe, Dauenhauer\u2019s first language was Tlingit; she did not learn English until she was eight. She earned a BA in anthropology from Alaska Methodist University in Anchorage and was the author of the poetry collection The Droning Shaman (1988).\r\n\u00a0\r\nShe published a volume of poetry and prose, Life Woven with Song, in 2000. An \u201cautoethnography\u201d of the Tlingit tribe, it contains autobiographical pieces detailing Dauenhauer\u2019s life in the natural world of the northern Pacific coast; the collection also includes short lyric poems and a cycle of dramatic plays depicting traditional Tlingit Raven stories. Influenced by the land and sea, Dauenhauer\u2019s work preserves the stories and oral culture of previous generations.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDauenhauer worked as a Tlingit language researcher, translating, transcribing, and compiling Tlingit stories, sometimes in collaboration with her husband, Richard Dauenhauer. Her books include a Tlingit grammar, Beginning Tlingit (1976). She was a Tlingit language researcher for the Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, from 1972 to 1973 and the principal researcher in language and cultural studies at the Sealaska Heritage Foundation in Juneau from 1983 to 1997.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDauenhauer was named the 1980 Humanist of the Year by the Alaska Humanities Forum. Her other awards included the Alaska Governor\u2019s Award for the Arts, an American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation, and the 2005 Community Spirit Award from the First People\u2019s Fund.\r\n\u00a0\r\nShe was a mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother and lived in Juneau, Alaska until her death.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
