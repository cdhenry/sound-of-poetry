His books of poetry include Anonymous Or (2002); All the Lavish in Common (2005), winner of the Juniper Poetry Prize; As Much As (2011); and Fragile Acts (2012), which was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award. His chapbooks include Assurances (2011) and Omnivore (2009). Peterson\u2019s poetry is known for its wild logic and painterly effects. Marilyn McCabe, reviewing Peterson in Rattle, noted, \u201chis poetic eye takes in the world, as we view a painting, not an orderly left to right, but a scan, a darting from one interesting element to another.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAs a visual artist, Peterson has exhibited widely, including shows with the Minnesota Center for the Book Arts, the El Paso Museum of Art, and the New Orleans Academy of Art. His honors and awards include fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Florida Fine Arts Council, among others. The former chair of the visual arts department at Pensacola State College, Peterson currently divides his time between Florida and Oregon.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
