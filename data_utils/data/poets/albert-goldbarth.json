His numerous highly-regarded collections are often filled with long poems which range in style from playful and conversational to serious and philosophical. Goldbarth\u2019s unique style is a mix of complex ideas, juxtapositions between dissimilar objects and facts, and detailed descriptions woven together with verbal play. Goldbarth \u201chas that rare gift of seeing metaphor in almost any event, of discovering a poem in the most unlikely places,\u201d wrote Robert Cording in the\u00a0Carolina Quarterly. Eric McHenry, writing for\u00a0Slate, noted that Goldbarth distinguishes himself from nearly all his contemporaries by writing in a style that is \u201ceffusive, sprawling, and instantly recognizable\u2014an aesthetic that might best be characterized as \u2018Why use one word when four will work just as well?\u2019 His poems do lack concentration in the most obvious sense of the word, but they make up for it with the other kind. Goldbarth pays rapt attention to the world around him, drawing one memorable connection after another.\u201d\n\r\nGoldbarth is a prolific writer who has published over 20 collections of poetry, a handful of essay collections, and a novel. His ravenously attentive style can be seen even in his earliest collections,\u00a0Opticks: A Poem in Seven Sections\u00a0(1974)\u00a0and\u00a0Comings Back\u00a0(1976). The topics and places covered in\u00a0Opticks\u00a0range far and wide\u2014encompassing the Illinois tollway, World War II, and Middle Age glass makers\u2014and are used to create an array of dramatic monologues. Goldbarth\u2019s next collection Comings Back: A Sequence of Poems, focuses on returns. The book, remarked Victor Contoski in\u00a0Prairie Schooner,\u00a0\u201csuggests an interesting perspective in which everything is seen from the original place, the original time \u2026 Goldbarth speaks of the poet as a maker of lists, and in effect the entire book is a list of various comings back, often in surprising contexts.\u201d\u00a0Comings Back\u00a0makes its impression as a whole, though it is full of disparate dreams and anecdotes, as well as jokes, personal letters, and quotations from a wide variety of sources. The separate parts of\u00a0Different Fleshes\u00a0(1979) are also closely related, tied together by perambulations of their cross-dressing main character, Vander Clyde/Barbette. The narrative travels from Paris to Texas, eventually focusing on present-day Austin and its contemporary gay bars. The book presents a circular structure of metamorphoses through the character of Vander Clyde/Barbette. \u201cDifferent Fleshes\u00a0is a work partly about the distance linking the past and present, more particularly about choices made which separate one sort of future from another,\u201d wrote\u00a0American Poetry Review\u00a0contributor Michael King.\n\nOriginal Light: New and Selected Poems 1973-1983\u00a0(1983) presents a wide selection of poems arranged thematically into three sections.\u00a0Diane Wakoski, writing in the\u00a0American Book Review,\u00a0saw the main theme of the book as \u201cwhat seeing really is and what really seeing is. [Goldbarth] explores light as the source of everything and like many philosophers looks for the original light, the source of everything in paradox and the paradoxes of physics.\u201d Goldbarth\u2019s \u201cpersonae include adolescent lovers, masochistic slaves, aphoristic fabulists, philosophical plumbers, and semi-literate students,\u201d wrote Michael Simms in the\u00a0Southwest Review.\u00a0\u201cHe fashions metaphors from the deductions of historians, theologians, and physicists, integrating their arguments into poems which remain, somehow, intensely personal and concrete.\u201d Simms concluded: \u201cHis ability to see and to see again encourages us to observe the world more closely and to take courage from the small happenings of our profoundly ordinary lives.\u201d\n\r\nGoldbarth has published numerous volumes of poetry and essays since\u00a0Original Light\u00a0and twice been awarded the National Book Critics Circle Award, for\u00a0Heaven and Earth: A Cosmology\u00a0(1991),\u00a0and\u00a0Saving Lives\u00a0(2001).\u00a0Heaven and Earth\u00a0outlines narratives about Goldbarth\u2019s father and his German relatives, and examines the many ways humans seek to communicate in spite of the numerous obstacles thrown in the way.\u00a0Saving Lives, a\u00a0Publisher\u2019s Weekly\u00a0reviewer noted \u201crepeats motifs detection and detective stories, radio, Rembrandt, aged relatives; these motifs let many poems focus on questions about dual, or hidden, identities or lives.\u201d Though his output is immense, and the breadth of his interest and knowledge astounding, Goldbarth\u2019s books rarely innovate on his basic style of gregarious, tender, and rambunctious prose-like lines, sometimes dismissed as \u201clineated essays.\u201d But though the poetry doesn\u2019t look or sound like much contemporary verse, which often depends on sparseness and a self-consciously elevated diction for its effects, Goldbarth\u2019s champions insist that his poetry actually shows a kind of expansive concentration, his language a sort of effusive distillation. In his review for\u00a0Slate, Eric McHenry noted that \u201cin spite of this omnivorousness, the poems aren\u2019t just big maximalist messes. Synthesis is Goldbarth\u2019s goal, and his gift.\u201d\nPerhaps in homage to that \u201comnivorousness,\u201d Goldbarth titled his next collection of selected poems, his first in 14 years,\u00a0The Kitchen Sink: New and Selected Poems 1972-2007\u00a0(2007). Reviewing the retrospective,\u00a0Judith Kitchen\u00a0in the\u00a0Georgia Review\u00a0described Goldbarth as \u201cthe American poet of his generation for the ages. Often humorous but always serious, Goldbarth combines erudite research, pop-culture fanaticism, and personal anecdote in ways that make his writings among the most stylistically recognizable in the literary world.\u201d Goldbarth\u2019s distinctive style has sometimes drawn criticism for just those things which distinguish it: sociability, exuberance, and a certain amount of catholicity. Reviewing\u00a0Budget Travel through Space and Time\u00a0(2005) for\u00a0Poetry,\u00a0D.H. Tracy\u00a0quipped that \u201cGoldbarth\u2019s work amounts to a poetry of lists, and, as some have pointed out, such a poetry has trouble outdoing itself \u2026 There can\u2019t be any meaning in the connections the poems draw when it is practically a premise that connections can be drawn between anything.\u201d But reviewers and readers alike continue to appreciate Goldbarth\u2019s poetry for its erudition, humor and insight.\nIn addition to poetry, Goldbarth has also written volumes of essays, including\u00a0A Sympathy of Souls\u00a0(1990),\u00a0Great Topics of the World\u00a0(1996) and\u00a0Many Circles: New and Selected Essays\u00a0(2001).\u00a0Goldbarth\u2019s essays cover subject matter that will be familiar to readers of his poetry: history, science, pop culture and autobiography. In\u00a0A Sympathy of Souls,\u00a0Goldbarth makes connections between seemingly unrelated topics (such as God and Mickey Mouse), demonstrating again and again how the past and present, the mundane and cosmic, continually connect and combine.\u00a0Many Circles\u00a0received high praise from all corners. The\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0admitted that \u201cGoldbarth is indeed addressing some of the greatest topics there are, and he handles them splendidly \u2026 with humor, intelligence and grace,\u201d and\u00a0Publisher\u2019s Weekly\u00a0put him in \u201cthe company of America\u2019s premiere literary essayists, somewhere between Annie Dillard and David Foster Wallace.\u201d\nThough his volumes of essays and his novel,\u00a0Pieces of Payne\u00a0(2003) a gallimaufry of history, science, romance and current events, have all been critically lauded, Goldbarth remains most noted for his poetry. The\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0contributor Phillip Lopate contended that Goldbarth\u2019s \u201cpoems are so complex and omnivorous that even when they don\u2019t quite succeed, you have to admire them. In a typical performance, he will juggle many different ideas and images, not only keeping them all in the air but establishing surprising connections among them that yield a large general meaning.\u201d Goldbarth himself has said that he believes he\u2019s \u201cwriting a poem that\u2019s probably Newtonian. It believes in counterbalance. It believes in an energy that can neither be created nor destroyed, and in the recycling of that energy inside of a viable and holistic system.\u201d\nAlbert Goldbarth has received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation. His poetry has been nominated for the National Book Award and the\u00a0Los Angeles Times\u00a0Book Prize. In 2008 he was awarded the Mark Twain Poetry Award from the Poetry Foundation. Goldbarth has taught for many years at Wichita State University, where he is the Adele Davis Distinguished Professor of Humanities.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
