He writes, translates, and publishes poetry and essays in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Haitian Creole. In a review of\u00a0The Splintered Face,\u00a0Jennifer Garfield described how \u201cAmirthanayagam\u2019s poems achieve a devastating intimacy that necessarily dissolves the separation between countries and peoples. \u2026 His rhyme and cadence are gentle and disarming, and the muscle of his poetry lies in its initial passivity, mimicking the helplessness of both the living dead and the simply living.\u201d\nAmirthanayagam\u2019s poems have won a Paterson Poetry Prize and a\u00a0Juegos Florales. His writing has appeared in the\u00a0New York Times,\u00a0the\u00a0Kenyon Review,\u00a0the\u00a0New England Review, BOMB, Siempre, La Gaceta,\u00a0and other magazines. It has also been included in numerous anthologies, including The United States of Poetry, Language for a New Century: Contemporary Poetry from the Middle East, Asia, and Beyond, and ALOUD: Voices from the Nuyorican Poets Cafe. A US diplomat, Amirthanayagam has lived in several countries, including Haiti, Belgium, Argentina, and the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Asia, South"]}}
