She earned a BA and MA in psychology from Northwestern University and trained as an art therapist at the Gestalt Institute of Chicago before turning her attention to poetry.\nHahn has published numerous poetry collections, including Harriet Rubin\u2019s Mother\u2019s Wooden Hand (1991); Incontinence (1993), winner of the Society of Midland Authors Award; Holiday (2001)\u00a0and Mother In Summer (2002), both included in Chicago Tribune's Best Books\u00a0of 2002; and The Scarlet Ibis (2007). The Scarlet Ibis was also performed as a verse play in 2007 and reprised in 2008. Her first play, Golf, premiered in Chicago in 2005. Her first novel, The Six Granddaughters of\u00a0Cecil Slaughter, was published in 2012.\u00a0She is the inaugural\u00a0writer-in-residence (2013-2014) at the Hemingway Foundation in Oak Park Illinois.\u00a0\nIn a review of Hahn\u2019s poetry collection Confession (1997) for Booklist, Patricia Monaghan noted, \u201cHahn\u2019s self-revelation is so startling, and her details so extraordinary, that she virtually detonates her poems with energy.\u201d Hahn\u2019s precise, lyrical work, which is described by some critics as neo-confessional, often explores family, sexuality, and loss.\u00a0\nHahn has been awarded fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the Illinois Arts Council, as well as Poetry\u2019s George Kent Prize and two Pushcart Prizes. She edited the literary journal TriQuarterly from 1997 until the shuttering of its print publication in 2010. Hahn lives in Winnetka, Illinois.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
