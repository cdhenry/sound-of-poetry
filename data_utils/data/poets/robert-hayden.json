Due to extreme nearsightedness, Hayden turned to books rather than sports in his childhood. After graduating from high school in 1932, he attended Detroit City College (now Wayne State University) on scholarship and later earned a graduate degree in English literature from the University of Michigan. As a teaching fellow, he was the first Black faculty member in Michigan\u2019s English department. Hayden eventually became the first African American to be appointed as Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress. His collections of poetry include Heart-Shape in the Dust (1940), Figure of Time (1955), A Ballad of Remembrance (1962), which won the grand prize at the First World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar, Senegal, Selected Poems (1966), Words in the Mourning Time (1970), The Night-Blooming Cereus (1972), Angle of Ascent: New and Selected Poems (1975), and American Journal (1978). Hayden\u2019s formal, elegant poems about the Black history and experience earned him a number of other major awards as well. \u201cRobert Hayden is now generally accepted,\u201d Frederick Glaysher stated in Hayden\u2019s Collected Prose, \u201cas the most outstanding craftsman of Afro-American poetry.\u201d\n\r\nThe historical basis for much of Hayden\u2019s poetry stemmed from his extensive study of American and African American history. Beginning in the 1930s, when he researched Black history for the Federal Writers\u2019 Project in his native Detroit, Hayden studied the story of Black people from their roots in Africa to their present condition in the United States. \u201cHistory,\u201d Charles T. Davis wrote in\u00a0Black is the Color of the Cosmos: Essays on Afro-American Literature and Culture, 1942-1981, \u201chas haunted Robert Hayden from the beginning of his career as a poet.\u201d As he once explained to Glenford E. Mitchell of World Order, Hayden saw history \u201cas a long, tortuous, and often bloody process of becoming, of psychic evolution.\u201d\n\r\nOther early influences on Hayden\u2019s development as a poet were W. H. Auden, under whom Hayden studied at the University of Michigan, and Stephen Vincent Benet, particularly Benet\u2019s poem \u201cJohn Brown\u2019s Body.\u201d That poem describes the Black reaction to General Sherman\u2019s march through Georgia during the Civil War and inspired Hayden to also write about that period of history, creating a series of poems on slavery and the Civil War that won him a Hopwood Award in 1942.\n\r\nAlthough history played a large role in Hayden\u2019s poetry, many of his works were also inspired by the poet\u2019s adherence to the Baha\u2019i faith, an Eastern religion that believes in a coming world civilization. Hayden served for many years as the poetry editor of the group\u2019s World Order magazine. The universal outlook of the Baha\u2019is also moved Hayden to reject any narrow racial classification for his work.\n\r\nJames Mann of the Dictionary of Literary Biography claimed that Hayden \u201cstands out among poets of his race for his staunch avowal that the work of black writers must be judged wholly in the context of the literary tradition in English, rather than within the confines of the ethnocentrism that is common in contemporary literature written by blacks.\u201d As Lewis Turco explained in the Michigan Quarterly Review, \u201cHayden has always wished to be judged as a poet among poets, not one to whom special rules of criticism ought to be applied in order to make his work acceptable in more than a sociological sense.\u201d This stance earned Hayden criticism during the polarized 1960s. He was accused of abandoning his racial heritage to conform to the standards of a white, European literary establishment. \u201cIn the 1960s,\u201d William Meredith wrote in his foreword to Collected Prose, \u201cHayden declared himself, at considerable cost in popularity, an American poet rather than a black poet, when for a time there was posited an unreconcilable difference between the two roles\u2026 He would not relinquish the title of American writer for any narrower identity.\u201d\nHowever, much of Hayden\u2019s best poetry is concerned with Black experience and history. \u201cThe gift of Robert Hayden\u2019s poetry,\u201d Vilma Raskin Potter remarked in MELUS, \u201cis his coherent vision of the black experience in this country as a continuing journey both communal and private.\u201d Hayden wrote about such historical figures as Nat Turner, Frederick Douglass, Malcolm X, Harriet Tubman, and Cinquez. He also wrote poems about the Underground Railroad, the Civil War, and the American slave trade. Edward Hirsch, writing in the Nation, called Hayden \u201can American poet, deeply engaged by the topography of American myth in his efforts to illuminate the American black experience.\u201d\n\r\nThough Hayden wrote in formal poetic forms, his range of voices and techniques gave his work a rich variety. \u201cHayden,\u201d Robert G. O\u2019Meally wrote in the Washington Post Book World, \u201cis a poet of many voices, using varieties of ironic black folk speech, and a spare, ebullient poetic diction, to grip and chill his readers. He draws characters of stark vividness as he transmutes cardinal points and commonplaces of history into dramatic action and symbol.\u201d \u201cHis work,\u201d Turco wrote, \u201cis unfettered in many ways, not the least of which is in the range of techniques available to him. It gives his imagination wings, allows him to travel throughout human nature.\u201d Speaking of Hayden\u2019s use of formal verse forms, Mann explained that Hayden\u2019s poems were \u201cformal in a nontraditional, original way, strict but not straight-jacketed\u201d and found that they also possessed \u201ca hard-edged precision of line that molds what the imagination wants to release in visually fine-chiseled fragmental stanzas that fit flush together with the rightness of a picture puzzle.\u201d\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1966, with the publication of Selected Poems, that Hayden first enjoyed widespread attention from the nation\u2019s literary critics. With each succeeding volume of poems his reputation was further enhanced until, in 1976 and his appointment as Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress, Hayden was generally recognized as one of the country\u2019s leading poets. Critics often point to Hayden\u2019s unique ability to combine the historical and the personal when speaking of his own life and the lives of his people. Writing in Obsidian: Black Literature in Review, Gary Zebrun argued that \u201cthe voice of the speaker in Hayden\u2019s best work twists and squirms its way out of anguish in order to tell, or sing, stories of American history\u2014in particular the courageous and plaintive record of Afro-American history\u2014and to chart the thoughts and feelings of the poet\u2019s own private space\u2026 Hayden is ceaselessly trying to achieve\u2026 transcendence, which must not be an escape from the horror of history or from the loneliness of individual mortality, but an ascent that somehow transforms the horror and creates a blessed permanence.\u201d\nHayden once said that he considered himself to be \u201ca poet who teaches in order to earn a living so that he can write a poem or two now and then.\u201d He taught at Fisk University for more than twenty years, where he rose to become a professor of English. Hayden ended his career with an eleven-year stint at the University of Michigan. His honors and awards included the Academy of American Poets Fellowship. He died in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1980. His Collected Prose (1984) was published posthumously.\n", "attrs": {}}
