She studied with\u00a0Seamus Heaney\u00a0at Queen\u2019s University, earning a BA and MA, and later returned as their first female writer-in-residence. She is the author of over 20 poetry collections including most recently Love, The Magician (2018), Blaris Moor (2015), The High Caul Cap (2012), and The Currach Requires No Harbours (2010). Her poems are layered collages of feminine and domestic imagery complicated by a liminal, active syntax that, in drawing attention to the weight of one phrase on another, emphasizes and questions our constructions of power and gender. Her work is reminiscent of\u00a0Rainer Maria Rilke\u00a0in its emotional scope and\u00a0John Ashbery\u00a0in its creation of rich interior landscapes. Praising McGuckian\u2019s\u00a0Selected Poems\u00a0(1997), Heaney said, \u201cHer language is like the inner lining of consciousness, the inner lining of English itself, and it moves amphibiously between the dreamlife and her actual domestic and historical experience as a woman in late-20th-century Ireland.\u201d\n\r\nMcGuckian has earned significant critical acclaim over the course of her career. Her poem \u201cThe Flitting,\u201d published under a male pseudonym, won the 1979 National Poetry Competition. In 1980 McGuckian published two chapbooks and also won the prestigious Eric Gregory Award. Her first collection,\u00a0The Flower Master\u00a0(1982), won the Poetry Society\u2019s Alice Hunt Bartlett Prize, the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature, and an award from the Ireland Arts Council.\u00a0On Ballycastle Beach\u00a0(1988) won the Cheltenham Award, and\u00a0The Currach Requires No Harbour\u00a0(2007) was shortlisted for the\u00a0Irish Times\u00a0Poetry Now Award. Her most recent collections include\u00a0Love, the\u00a0Magician\u00a0(2018) and\u00a0Selected Poems 1978-1994\u00a0(2018).\u00a0\n\r\nHer honors also include the Bass Ireland Award for Literature, the Denis Devlin Award, and the American Ireland Fund\u2019s Literary Award. She won the Forward Prize for Best Poem for \u201cShe Is in the Past, She Has This Grace.\u201d She is a\u00a0member of\u00a0the selective\u00a0Irish arts association Asod\u00e1na.\n\r\nShe edited\u00a0The Big Striped Golfing Umbrella: Poems by Young People from Northern Ireland\u00a0(1985) and cotranslated, with Eilean Ni Chuilleanain, the Irish poet\u00a0Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill\u2019s collection\u00a0The Water Horse\u00a0(1999). She is also the author of\u00a0Horsepower Pass By! A Study of the Car in the Poetry of Seamus Heaney\u00a0(1999).\nMcGuckian is a professor of English at Queen's University.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Ireland & Northern Ireland"]}}
