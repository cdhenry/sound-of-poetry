He earned a BA from Syracuse University and an MA from Brown University. His numerous poetry collections include Present Vanishing: Poems (2008) and Ode to the Cold War: Poems New and Selected (1997).\n\r\nAllen was one of the founders of Expansive poetry, a movement that started in the 1980s and includes New Formalism and New Narrative. Allen explained in an essay, \u201cExpansive Poetry is a narrative, dramatic and sometimes lyric poetry of the late 20th Century that conveys significant non-Confessional observations, thoughts and feelings about the world outside the Self and about the Self\u2019s various relationships with this outer world. In carrying such content, it generally uses traditional rhyme and meter\u2014sometimes loosened or roughened\u2014incorporating natural speech patterns.\u201d\n\r\nInfluenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson, A.E. Housman, Ben Jonson, and Robert Frost, Allen \u201cranges with ease from astronomy to politics to domestic situations; his poetry captures great swatches of real and imagined experience in nimble style,\u201d according to Publishers Weekly. Allen says in a Poetry Daily interview, \u201cIn a time still so influenced by Archibald MacLeish\u2019s admonition that \u2018a poem should not mean, / but be,\u2019 my task is to have the poem \u2018be\u2019 and mean something\u2014a non-preachy something, but something.\u201d\n\r\nAllen won the Robert Frost Prize for Poetry, the Hart Crane Poetry Prize, the Union League Civic & Arts Foundation Poetry Prize, the May Caroline Davis Poetry Prize from the Poetry Society of America, the San Jose Bicentennial Poetry Prize, and a Pushcart Prize, and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. He also received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Ingram Merrill Foundation. His poetry was included in several Best American Poetry and Best American Spiritual Writing anthologies, and he coedited several science fiction anthologies, including Science Fiction: The Future (1971) and Looking Ahead (1975).\n\r\nHe was the Director of Creative Writing and Charles A. Dana Endowed Chair Professor at the University of Bridgeport until his retirement in 2001. In 2010 he was named poet laureate of Connecticut and will serve in that position through 2015. He lived in Connecticut with his wife, poet and fiction writer L.N. Allen, until his death in late 2017.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
