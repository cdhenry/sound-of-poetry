The first in his family to graduate from college, McCrae earned a BA at Linfield College, an MA at the University of Iowa, an MFA at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, and a JD at Harvard Law School.\r\n\u00a0\r\nMcCrae is the author of several poetry collections, including Mule (2011);\u00a0Blood (2013);\u00a0The Animal Too Big to Kill (2015);\u00a0In the Language of My Captor (Wesleyan University Press, 2017), which was a finalist for the National Book Award; and The Gilded Auction Block\u00a0(2019). His work has also been featured in The Best American Poetry 2010, edited by Amy Gerstler, and his honors include a Whiting Writers\u2019 Award and a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts.\r\n\u00a0\r\nMcCrae\u2019s attention to both meter and its breakage in his poems emphasizes the chafe of historical accounting against contemporary slippage, engaging this country\u2019s troubling history and continuation of oppression and violence. In a 2013 conversation with Danniel Schoonebeek for PEN America, McCrae stated, \u201cFor me, writing into history is a way to grapple with the terrifying certainty of the present. That is, the more one studies and writes with history, the more often one discovers that apparently large and important human developments\u2014a lot of things most people would call \u2018progress\u2019\u2014are superficial.\u201d In a 2014 review,\u00a0Michael Klein observed, \u201cBlood\u00a0is as radical in structure as it is in the unbridled wildness of its emotional center. Lines descend on the page in varying lengths usually culminating into a single stanza and often broken or interrupted by a caesura or sutured with a slash\u2014a blade, appropriately\u2014or, as I came to think of the slash: a mark in the account where the tape got spliced. It\u2019s a powerful visual effect\u2014where the content is so married to its delivery\u2014and approaches\u2014strange and as hallucinatory as it can be\u2014the dignity of oration. These are poems that are unrelenting and immediate\u2014never delicate and never gentle.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nMcCrae lives in New York City and teaches at Columbia University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
