Baker\u2019s parents have M\u0101ori and P\u0101keh\u0101 ancestry, which has influenced her writing and work. Baker earned a BA and an MA from Victoria University, where she was also the Wellington Writer in Residence in 2014. She authored the poetry collections m\u0101tuhi / needle (2004), k\u014diwi / bone (2010), and waha / mouth (2014). Her work has been anthologized in The Best of Best New Zealand Poems (2011) and The Auckland University Press Anthology of New Zealand Literature (2012), among others. On her work, David Eggleton says that there is \u201csensuousness reflected in the verse, but in a conflicted way\u2014undercut by a sense of smoldering emotion ... as though an earlier vulnerability has left the poet bruised by experience.\u201d\nBaker was the 2009 Arts Queensland Poet in Residence and received the 2015\u201316 Creative New Zealand Berlin Writer\u2019s Residency. She has taught at the International Institute of Modern Letters.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Pacific Islands"]}}
