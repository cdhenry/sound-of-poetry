Her collections of poetry include Black Milk (2005);\u00a0HIV, Mon Amour (1999), which won a James Laughlin Award and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award; and What Silence Equals (1993). Given an HIV diagnosis at age 30, in her poetry, Dent explored the brutal realities and emotional complexities of living with a fatal illness. In an interview after Dent\u2019s death of AIDS-related complications, Adrienne Rich said, \u201cTory Dent teaches us that poetry must speak out of extremity.\u201d And in an essay, Nicole Cooley described how Dent\u2019s work, \u201cwith its reliance on strategies of Language Poetry and the New York School, its long Whitmanesque line structure, its web of allusions, and its complex syntactic patterning \u2026 challenges our assumptions about writing about both the world and the body.\u201d An excerpt from Dent\u2019s memoir-in-progress appeared in Bearing Life: Women\u2019s Writings on Childlessness (2001).\nDent\u2019s honors and awards included fellowships from the New York Foundation for the Arts, the Money for Women/Barbara Deming Memorial Fund, the Rona Jaffe Foundation Writers\u2019 Award, and the PEN American Center. In 2015, Syracuse University Press published her Collected Poems.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
