Publishers Weekly, reviewing Poemland, noted that Minnis \u201cmixes the postmodern with the nearly archaic.\u201d As Boston Review critic Sasha Steensen observed of Minnis\u2019s trademark ellipses in a 2009 review of Bad Bad, \u201cHesitation, resolution, omission, inclusion, decoration, and punctuation, the ellipses are, on the one hand, the bullet-holes that remain after Minnis\u2019s speaker takes shots at the reader. On the other, they are evidence of the unsteadiness of the speaker\u2019s own hand [\u2026] embody[ing] the vulnerability that so often lurks behind the book\u2019s defiance.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nMinnis is the author of several collections of poetry, including Zirconia (2001), which won the Alberta Prize; Bad Bad (2007); and Poemland (2009). She lives in Boulder.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
