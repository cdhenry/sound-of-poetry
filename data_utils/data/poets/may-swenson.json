Swenson earned a BA from Utah State University and briefly worked as a reporter in Salt Lake City. She moved to New York City in the 1930s and in 1959 she began working at New Directions Press, the modernist publishing house founded by James Laughlin. Swenson is considered one of mid-century America\u2019s foremost poets; her typographic innovations and exuberance earned comparisons to e.e. cummings and her careful attention to the suggestiveness of objects, persons, and events of ordinary life could recall Elizabeth Bishop, with whom Swenson corresponded for decades. Swenson\u2019s numerous collections of poetry include Another Animal (1954), A Cage of Spines (1958), To Mix with Time: New and Selected Poems (1963), Half Sun Half Sleep (1967), Iconographs (1970), New and Selected Things Taking Place (1978) and In Other Words (1987). Further collections, including The Love Poems (1991), Nature: Poems Old and New (1994), and May Out West (1996) were all published after her death.\nSwenson\u2019s poetry was widely praised for its precise and beguiling imagery, and for the quality of its personal and imaginative observations. Taking inspiration from daily events, ordinary rituals, and the natural world, Swenson revealed \u201cthe larger, warmer energies of earth,\u201d according to poet Richard Howard. As Priscilla Long commented in the Women\u2019s Review of Books, \u201cSwenson was a visionary poet, a prodigious observer of the fragile and miraculous natural world.\u201d And in the Los Angeles Times Eloise Klein Healy described how \u201ccorrespondences among all life forms pour from her work, confirming that nothing is meaningless. The universe\u2019s basic beauty and balance is the stuff and soul of her poems.\u201d\nThe poet William Stafford once observed: \u201cNo one today is more deft and lucky in discovering a poem than May Swenson. Her work often appears to be proceeding calmly, just descriptive and accurate; but then suddenly it opens into something that looms beyond the material, something that impends and implies\u2026 So graceful is the progression in her poems that they launch confidently into any form, carrying through it to easy, apt variations. Often her way is to define things, but the definitions have a stealthy trend; what she chooses and the way she progresses heap upon the reader a consistent, incremental effect.\u201d\nSwenson\u2019s ability to draw out the metaphysical implications of the material world were widely commented on; but she was also known for her lighthearted, even joyous, take on life in decades characterized by febrile \u201cconfessional\u201d verse. Riddles, chants, and calligrams\u2014experiments in typography and layout\u2014dot Swenson\u2019s oeuvre. Reviewing Half Sun, Half Sleep Karl Shapiro wrote: \u201cThe whole volume is an album of experiments\u2026 that pay off. It is strange to see the once-radical carmen figuratum, the calligraphic poem, spatial forms, imagist and surreal forms\u2014all the heritage of the early years of the century\u2014being used with such ease and unselfconsciousness.\u201d\n\r\nSwenson herself wrote that the experience of poetry is \u201cbased in a craving to get through the curtains of things as they appear, to things as they are, and then into the larger, wilder space of things as they are becoming. This ambition involves a paradox: an instinctive belief in the senses as exquisite tools for this investigation and, at the same time, a suspicion about their crudeness.\u201d Swenson also noted: \u201cThe poet, tracing the edge of a great shadow whose outline shifts and varies, proving there is an invisible moving source of light behind, hopes (naively, in view of his ephemerality) to reach and touch the foot of that solid whatever-it-is that casts the shadow. If sometimes it seems he does touch it, it is only to be faced with a more distant, even less accessible mystery. Because all is movement\u2014all is breathing change.\u201d\n\r\nSwenson also wrote poetry for children, including Poems to Solve (1966), More Poems to Solve (1968), and Spell Coloring Book (1976). Of Poems to Solve, Swenson acknowledged, \u201cIt is essential, of course, with a device such as this to make not a riddle-pretending-to-be-a-poem but a poem that is also, and as if incidentally, a riddle\u2014a solvable one. The aim is not to mystify or mislead but to clarify and make recognizable through the reader\u2019s own uncontaminated perceptions.\u201d In addition to these books and her many collections of poetry, Swenson also wrote a one-act play, The Floor (1960), and co-translated, with Leif Sjoberg, Windows and Stones: Selected Poems of Tomas Transtromer (1972).\nSwenson left New York City in 1967, when she moved to Sea Cliff, Long Island where she lived with her partner, the author R.R. Knudson. During her prolific career, Swenson received numerous literary awards and nominations for her poetry. She taught and served as poet-in-residence at many institutions in both the United States and Canada, and she held fellowships from the Ford Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the MacArthur Foundation. She was the recipient of the Shelley Memorial Award, the Bollingen Prize, and Award in Literature from the National Institute of Arts and Letters. She received an honorary degree from Utah State University as well as their Distinguished Service Gold Medal. Swenson was a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets from 1980-1989.\n", "attrs": {}}
