He studied engineering and art at Brown University, where he was active in Vietnam War protests. Lum is the author of two books of poetry: Expounding the Doubtful Points (1987) and The Nanjing Massacre: Poems (2013), a book inspired by Iris Chang\u2019s The Rape of Nanking (1997). Lum\u2019s method is primarily visual; in an interview with Honolulu Magazine, he described his process: \u201cI like to look at a moment in time and reflect on that. A lot of my poems are related to or inspired by photographs. I look at a photograph and I try to write something down\u2014a description of what I see. I look at it again and write something more.\u201d Lum lives in Hawaii, where he is an engineer and a real estate broker.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Pacific Islands"]}}
