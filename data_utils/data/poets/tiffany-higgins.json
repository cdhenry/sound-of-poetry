Audio recordings of her poems and commentary on poetics appear on the website,\u00a0From the Fishouse.\u00a0 Evie Shockley wrote of\u00a0And Aeneas Stares into Her Helmet: \u201cAeneas\u00a0won me over with its intelligence, wit, and unpredictability. I loved the depth and breadth of the poet's allusions: wars throughout history\u2014from the Trojan War to the \u2018War on Terror\u2019 and the Iraq War\u2014are invoked through literary allusions to Virgil, Whitman, and the Bible, as well as pop culture references to phenomena like the Beatles and reality TV.\u201dHiggins translates contemporary Brazilian writing and blogs on Brazil. She teaches at several colleges in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
