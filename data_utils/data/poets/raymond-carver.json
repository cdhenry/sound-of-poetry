He was married and the father of two before he was 20, and he held a number of low-paying jobs: he \u201cpicked tulips, pumped gas, swept hospital corridors, swabbed toilets, [and] managed an apartment complex,\u201d according to Bruce Weber in a New York Times Magazine profile of the author. Not coincidentally, \u201cof all the writers at work today, Carver may have [had] the most distinct vision of the working class,\u201d as Ray Anello observed in a Newsweek article. Carver attended Chico State University, where he studied with John Gardner, and earned his BA from Humboldt State College in 1963. He published his first short-story and poem while at Humboldt State. Carver went on to attend the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. Returning to the Northwest, he took jobs as a janitor, farm worker, and delivery man. His first wife, Maryann Burk, also held a series of jobs to support Carver as he began writing and eventually publishing acclaimed short-story collections such as Will You Please Be Quiet, Please? (1976), What We Talk About When We Talk About Love (1981), and Cathedral (1983). Carver also published poetry collections, including A New Path to the Waterfall (1989), which was published posthumously.\nCarver\u2019s stories mainly take place in his native Pacific Northwest region; they are peopled with the type of lower-middle-class characters the author was familiar with while he was growing up. In a New York Review of Books article, Thomas R. Edwards describes Carver\u2019s fictional world as a place where \u201cpeople worry about whether their old cars will start, where unemployment or personal bankruptcy are present dangers, where a good time consists of smoking pot with the neighbors, with a little cream soda and M&M\u2019s on the side \u2026 Carver\u2019s characters are waitresses, mechanics, postmen, high school teachers, factory workers, door-to-door salesmen. [Their surroundings are] not for them a still unspoiled scenic wonderland, but a place where making a living is as hard, and the texture of life as drab, for those without money, as anywhere else.\u201d\nIn introducing readers to his world of the desperation of ordinary people, Carver created tales that are \u201cbrief \u2026 but by no means stark,\u201d noted Geoffrey Wolff in his New York Times Book Review piece on Will You Please Be Quiet, Please? \u201cThey imply complexities of action and motive and they are especially artful in their suggestion of repressed violence. No human blood is shed in any of these stories, yet almost all of them hold a promise of mayhem of some final, awful breaking from confines, and breaking through to liberty.\u201d The theme of breaking from confines is central to one of the stories, \u201cNeighbors,\u201d in which Bill and Arlene Miller agree to feed their neighbors\u2019 cat while the neighbors, the Stones, are on vacation. With access to the Stones\u2019 home, the Millers find themselves increasingly taken with their friends\u2019 clothes, furniture, and other belongings. Bill and Arlene, in fact, begin to assume the identities of the Stones; \u201ceach finds this strangely stimulating, and their sex life prospers, though neither can find anything much to say about it at all,\u201d reported Edwards. The end of the story finds the Millers clinging to the Stones\u2019 door as their neighbors return, knowing that their rich fantasy life will soon end.\n\r\nThe author\u2019s \u201cfirst book of stories explored a common plight rather than a common subject,\u201d noted New York Times Book Review critic Michael Wood. \u201cHis characters were lost or diminished in their own different ways. The 17 stories in [Carver\u2019s third collection, What We Talk about When We Talk about Love], make up a more concentrated volume, less a collection than a set of variations on the themes of marriage, infidelity and the disquieting tricks of human affection.\u201d Newsweek\u2019s Peter S. Prescott noted that Carver was concerned \u201cwith the collapse of human relationships. Some of his stories take place at the moment things fall apart; others, after the damage has been done, while the shock waves still reverberate. Alcohol and violence are rarely far removed from what happens, but sometimes, in another characteristic maneuver, Carver will nudge the drama that triggers a crisis aside to show that his story has really been about something else all along.\u201d Weber described Carver\u2019s unique, oft-imitated style in the New York Times Magazine: \u201cA typical sentence is blunt and uncomplicated, eschewing the ornaments of descriptive adverbs and parenthetical phrases. His rhythms are often repetitive or brusque, as if to suggest the strain of people learning to express newly felt things, fresh emotions. Time passes in agonizingly linear fashion, the chronology of a given scene marked by one fraught and simple gesture after another. Dialogue is usually clipped, and it is studded with commonplace observations of the concrete objects on the table or on the wall rather than the elusive, important issues in the air.\u201d\n\r\nOf Carver\u2019s 1984 short fiction collection, Cathedral, \u201cit would be hard to imagine a more dispirited assortment of figures,\u201d declared David Lehman in a Newsweek review. In each story, a \u201cnote of transcendent indifference, beyond resignation or fatigue, is sounded,\u201d adds Lehman, cautioning, \u201cfun to read they\u2019re not.\u201d But, the critic stresses, \u201cit\u2019s impossible to ignore Carver\u2019s immense talent.\u201d In Cathedral, Carver rewrote the ending of one of his most acclaimed stories from What We Talk about When We Talk about Love. The original story, \u201cThe Bath,\u201d is about a mother who orders a special cake for her eight-year-old son\u2019s birthday\u2014but the boy is hit by a car on that day and is rushed to the hospital, where he lingers in a coma. The baker, aware only that the parents haven\u2019t picked up their expensive cake, badgers them with endless calls demanding his money. As the story ends, the boy\u2019s fate is still unknown, and the desperate parents hear the phone ring again. Cathedral retells this story (now titled \u201cA Small, Good Thing\u201d) up to the final phone ring. At this point, ambiguity vanishes; Carver reveals that the boy has died, and the call is from the irate baker. But this time the parents confront the baker with the circumstances, and the apologetic man invites them over to his bakery. There he tells the parents his own sad story of loneliness and despair and feeds them fresh coffee and warm rolls, because \u201ceating is a small, good thing in a time like this.\u201d\n\r\n\u201cIn revising \u2018The Bath\u2019 into \u2018A Small, Good Thing,\u2019 Carver has indeed gone into [what he describes as] \u2018the heart of what the story is about,\u2019 and in the process has written an entirely new story\u2014has created, if you will, a completely new world,\u201d declared Jonathan Yardley in the Washington Post Book World. \u201cThe first version is beautifully crafted and admirably concise, but lacking in genuine compassion; the mysterious caller is not so much a human being as a mere voice, malign and characterless. But in the second version that voice becomes a person, one whose own losses are, in different ways, as crippling and heartbreaking as the one suffered by the grieving parents.\u201d As Anatole Broyard wrote in a New York Times review of Cathedral, \u201cIt is typical of Mr. Carver\u2019s stories that comfort against adversity is found in incongruous places, that people find improbable solace. The improbable and the homely are [the author\u2019s] territory. He works in the bargain basement of the soul.\u201d\nIrving Howe claimed that Carver\u2019s stories evoke \u201cstrong American literary traditions. Formally, they summon remembrances of Hemingway and perhaps Stephen Crane, masters of tightly packed fiction. In subject matter they draw upon the American voice of loneliness and stoicism, the native soul locked in this continent\u2019s space. [The author\u2019s] characters, like those of many earlier American writers, lack a vocabulary that can release their feelings, so they must express themselves mainly through obscure gesture and berserk display.\u201d And Paul Gray, writing about Cathedral in Time, said that \u201cCarver\u2019s art masquerades as accident, scraps of information that might have been overheard at the supermarket check-out or local beer joint. His most memorable people live on the edge: of poverty, alcoholic self-destruction, loneliness. Something in their lives denies them a sense of community. They feel this lack intensely, yet are too wary of intimacy to touch other people, even with language.\u201d\n\r\nSuch appraisals of his writing left Carver himself a little wary. He told Weber: \u201cUntil I started reading these reviews of my work, praising me, I never felt the people I was writing about were so bad. \u2026 The waitress, the bus driver, the mechanic, the hotel keeper. God, the country is filled with these people. They\u2019re good people. People doing the best they could.\u201d Carver\u2019s 1988 short fiction collection Where I\u2019m Calling From, released shortly before his death, combined new and previously published stories. It was nominated for both a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Critics Circle Award.\n\r\nCarver also wrote extensively as a poet. A collection of his poetry, including some works being written shortly before his death, was published in A New Path to the Waterfall. Although he had already released a volume of his collected verse, the diagnosis of lung cancer inspired him to write another volume. These poems are characterized by a reliance on sentence-sounds and a structure steeped in storytelling. Edna Longley commented in the London Review of Books that \u201call his writing tends toward dramatic monologue, present-tense soliloquy that wears the past like a hairshirt.\u201d He explored tortured marriages and strained familial relationships, all of which lead him bravely into discussing his own terminal illness. Longley praised Carver for his ability to forge solid beginnings and endings: \u201cA Carver poem instantly establishes its presence.\u201d\nIn 1992 a collection of Carver\u2019s early works was published. No Heroics, Please: Uncollected Writings contains poems, essays, book reviews, and other pieces that Carver had chosen not to include in any of his other collected work. Several of the short stories included had only been published before in student literary magazines. Of interest was the fact that in these stories Carver uses literary devises such as flashbacks and experimentation with verb tenses\u2014techniques he shunned in his later work. Several of Carver\u2019s previously published short stories received attention when acclaimed film director Robert Altman turned them into a motion picture. Although Altman took some liberties in adapting these stories for the screen, they remained essentially true to Carver\u2019s ideas. The stories were collected into the book Short Cuts, which bears the same name as the movie.\nFrom the late 1970s until his death, Carver lived with and was married to the poet Tess Gallagher, who is the literary executor of his estate. Gallagher ushered into print Beginners (2009), the original version of Carver\u2019s book What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. The original text shows the final version had been severely edited by Carver\u2019s editor Gordon Lish. The original was included in the Library of America\u2019s Raymond Carver: Collected Stories (2009): the book \u201cpushed the reset button on understanding Ray,\u201d Gallagher claimed, \u201cwhat he cared about in his writing, his tone, his care for his characters.\u201d\n\u201cI never figured I\u2019d make a living writing short stories,\u201d Carver told Penelope Moffet in a Publishers Weekly interview only a few months before he died. \u201cHow far in this world are you going to get writing short stories? I never had stars in my eyes. I never had the big-score mentality.\u201d Astonished by his literary prominence, Carver told Moffet that fame \u201cnever ceases to amaze me. And that\u2019s not false modesty, either. I\u2019m pleased and happy with the way things have turned out. But I was surprised.\u201d\nRaymond Carver died of lung cancer in his home on the Olympic Peninsula in 1988.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
