Arnold\u2019s second collection of poetry, Made Flesh (2008), is \u201cmotored by vividly earthy language and disguised philosophical sophistication,\u201d observed Publishers Weekly in a starred review, praising \u201csequences neither (quite) lyric nor narrative, but erotic and ever alert.\u201d The raw, emotional intensity of Made Flesh stands in stark reply to the classical, formal mastery displayed in Arnold\u2019s first collection, Shells (1999), which won the 1998 Yale Younger Poets Award.\n\r\nHis honors included the Amy Lowell Traveling Poetry Scholarship, the Joseph Brodsky Rome Prize Fellowship from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the US-Japan Creative Artists Exchange Fellowship, the Alfred Hodder Fellowship from Princeton University, a Dobie Paisano Residency, and a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship. A Fulbright Scholar at Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, Colombia, Arnold was also an avid musician and performed as a member of the band Iris.\n\r\nIn 2009, Arnold traveled to Japan to research volcanoes for a planned book of poetry. In April of that year, he disappeared while hiking on the island of Kuchinoerabujima. In the New York Times, the poet David Orr mourned the loss of Arnold, but noted it would \u201cbe a mistake to think of him as a writer silenced before his prime... His shelf space may be smaller than one would wish, but he earned every bit of it.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
