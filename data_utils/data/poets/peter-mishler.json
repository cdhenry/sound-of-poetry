He is the author of\u00a0Fludde\u00a0(Sarabande Books,\u00a02018), selected by Dean Young for the Kathryn A. Morton Prize in Poetry. About Mishler\u2019s poems David Ferry writes, \u201cThere\u2019s a powerful moral imagination at work in\u00a0Fludde, and its poems are darkly and passionately self-knowing about the consequences of how the childhood self is, as it grows, incorporated into the world around it.\u201d\nAs an editor, Mishler presently curates a contemporary poetry interview series for\u00a0Literary Hub. He lives in Kansas City.\n", "attrs": {}}
