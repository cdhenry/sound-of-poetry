She earned a BA at Harvard University, an MFA at Sarah Lawrence College, and an MS at Pratt Institute. She is the author of numerous poetry books, many of which have been published in print and in interactive hypermedia formats. Her work includes Dragon Logic (2013), Zone : Zero (2008), True North (1997), and Give the Body Back (1991). She edited What\u2019s Become of Eden: Poems of Family at Century\u2019s End (1994) and coedited, with Anneliese Wagner, River Poems (1992). Strickland\u2019s poetry was included in Best American Poetry 2013, edited by Denise Duhamel. \u00a0 Strickland has received praise for her ability to combine research and associative play in her poems. Awarding Strickland the Boston Review Prize for the poem \u201cThe Ballad,\u201d poet Heather McHugh observed in her judge\u2019s statement, \u201cOne of the poem\u2019s great virtues is its capacity to send off from its original premises more and more shooting stars of wild association, while never belaboring the host of fundamental\u2014yet sometimes just delicately implicit\u2014relations: relations that arise in the mind, over the course of a sympathetic reading, as spectres of near and distant fires, glasses (mirrors, microscopes, telescopes), sandmen, time-keepers, dreamers, and dreaders.\u201d In a Bookslut interview with Kate Greenstreet, Strickland responded to whether, as \u201cacts of research,\u201d her books seek to resolve questions. \u201cNo, there is never \u2018an answer\u2019; the result of research is to open up deeper, older, newer, more free-flowing or more urgent questions,\u201d she said. \u201cThe result of research is to begin again, having incorporated more, been more transformed; a sort of \u2018Look! We Have Come Through!\u2019 feeling, as D.H. Lawrence says.\u201d  \u00a0 A member of the board of directors of the Electronic Literature Organization, Strickland is the recipient of fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Yaddo, Fundaci\u00f3n Valpara\u00edso, Djerassi, MacDowell, and the New York Foundation for the Arts; a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts; and the Poetry Society of America\u2019s Alice Fay Di Castagnola Award. Strickland has taught at the University of Utah and the Georgia Institute of Technology. She lives in New York City.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
