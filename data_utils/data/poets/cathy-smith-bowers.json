As a high-school English teacher, she discovered her urge to write. In an interview, she noted of that time, \u201cI stayed one lesson ahead of my students. I had to do that to be a writer. It was huge.\u201d Bowers\u2019s collections of poetry include The Love That Ended Yesterday in Texas (1992), Traveling in Time of Danger (1999), A Book of Minutes (2004), The Candle I Hold Up to See You (2009), and Like Shining from Shook Foil (2010).
