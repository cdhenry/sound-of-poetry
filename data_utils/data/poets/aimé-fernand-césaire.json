He was not only responsible for Cahier d\u2019un retour au pays natal (first published in Spanish 1942; original French version 1947; translated as Memorandum on My Martinique, 1947), a widely acknowledged masterpiece documenting the 20th-century colonial condition, but he was also an accomplished playwright. Like his poetry and polemical essays, C\u00e9saire\u2019s plays explore the paradox of Black identity under French colonial rule. C\u00e9saire\u2019s shift to drama in the late 1950s and 1960s allowed him to integrate the modernist and surrealist techniques of his poetry and the polemics of his prose. In what C\u00e9saire describes as his \u201ctriptych\u201d of plays, La Trag\u00e9die du roi Christophe (published 1963, produced 1964; translated as The Tragedy of King Christophe, 1970), Une Saison au Congo (published 1965; translated as A Season in the Congo, 1968; produced 1976), and Une Temp\u00eate (published and produced 1969; translated as A Tempest, 1985), he explores a series of related themes, especially the efforts of Blacks\u2014whether in Africa, the United States, or the Caribbean\u2014to resist the powers of colonial domination.\nC\u00e9saire was born in Basse-Pointe, in the north of the island of Martinique, the second of the six children of Fernand C\u00e9saire, a minor government official, and his wife, El\u00e9onore, a seamstress. Although the family was poor, C\u00e9saire received a good education and early showed his aptitude for studies. He first attended the Lyc\u00e9e Schoelcher in Fort-de-France, the capital of Martinique, and then he received a scholarship to attend the prestigious Lyc\u00e9e Louis le Grand in Paris. There he met a Senegalese student, the future poet and African politician L\u00e9opold Senghor. In 1934 C\u00e9saire, with Senghor and Guyanan poet L\u00e9on Damas, founded the student journal Etudiant Noir (Black Student). This group of Black Francophone intellectuals developed the concept of \u201cNegritude,\u201d the embrace of Blackness and Africanness as a counter to a legacy of colonial self-hatred.\nIn 1935 C\u00e9saire entered the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, where he studied Black American writers, especially the poets of the Harlem Renaissance. During this time he traveled to Dalmatia and began work on his Cahier d\u2019un retour au pays natal. With Senghor, C\u00e9saire read and discussed the ethnologist Leo Frobenius\u2019s Kulturgeschichte Afrikas (1933, History of African Culture; translated into French as Histoire de la civilization africaine, 1936). C\u00e9saire eventually passed the agr\u00e9gation des lettres, the national competitive examination that leads to a career in teaching. In 1937 he married fellow Martinican student Suzanne Rossi. Their son, Jacques, the first of C\u00e9saire\u2019s four sons and two daughters, was born in 1938. In 1939 C\u00e9saire and Suzanne returned to Martinique to take up teaching positions at Lyc\u00e9e Schoelcher. Among C\u00e9saire\u2019s students were the writer Edouard Glissant and the critic of colonialism Frantz Fanon.\nIn 1939 C\u00e9saire published his first version of Cahier d\u2019un retour au pays natal in the journal Volont\u00e9s (Intentions). In this long autobiographical poem, C\u00e9saire rejected European culture, accepting his African and Caribbean roots. Juxtaposing historical data, descriptions of nature, and dream imagery, he praises the contributions of the Black race to world civilization. The poem was first published as a book in Spanish in 1942, then in French in 1947. C\u00e9saire revised the poem considerably before finally publishing the definitive version in 1956. Cahier d\u2019un retour au pays natal has become one of the best-known French poems of the 20th century.\nC\u00e9saire and his wife returned to the Caribbean as World War II began. Although Martinique was far removed from Europe, as a French territory it suffered economically from a German blockade, then later from censorship imposed by a representative of the Vichy government. During the war, C\u00e9saire became increasingly critical of the Vichy government and established himself as a political voice in Martinique. In 1941 he and Suzanne founded the anticolonialist journal Tropiques (Tropics) to promote Martinican culture; he was able to publish the journal in spite of the censor. That year C\u00e9saire received a visit from Andr\u00e9 Breton, the founder of surrealism, who had read C\u00e9saire\u2019s poetry and crossed the Atlantic to try to convince him to join his movement. Under the influence of surrealism, C\u00e9saire wrote his second collection of poetry, Les Armes miraculeuses (1946, Miraculous Arms), and later Soleil cou-coup\u00e9 (1948, Sun Cut Throat), a title taken from Guillaume Apollinaire\u2018s poem \u201cZone\u201d (1912). C\u00e9saire\u2019s essay \u201cPo\u00e9sie et connaissance\u201d (Poetry and Knowledge), published in Tropiques in 1945, espouses the surrealist principle of poetry as a means of liberating subconscious truth.\nC\u00e9saire became active in regional politics and was elected mayor of Fort-de-France and deputy to the Constituent National Assembly on the French communist party ticket in 1945. He then successfully fought to have Martinique and Guadeloupe recognized as overseas departments of France, which, as scholar Janis Pallister explains, the communists believed would give the islands greater power within the political system. Henceforth, C\u00e9saire divided his time between Paris and Martinique. In 1947 he became cofounder of another journal, Pr\u00e9sence africaine (African Presence), which published the works of Black Francophone writers, notably those of C\u00e9saire\u2019s Martinican compatriot Joseph Sobel. In the 1960s the journal evolved into a publishing house of the same name.\nC\u00e9saire turned his attention to the African diaspora in his poetry collection Corps perdu (1950; translated as Lost Body, 1986). During the 1950s and 1960s, C\u00e9saire remained active in both politics and literature. In the 1950s he wrote several important political essays, including Discours sur le colonialisme (1950; translated as Discourse on Colonialism, 1972) and Lettre \u00e0 Maurice Thorez (1956, Letter to Maurice Thorez), the latter of which explains his break with the communist Party after the Soviet invasion of Hungary. In 1957 C\u00e9saire founded the Parti Progressiste Martiniquais (Martinique Progressive Party), and in 1959 he participated in the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome. While maintaining his duties as the elected deputy from Martinique to the French National Assembly in Paris, he wrote two collections of poetry on Africa and the slave experience, Ferrements (1960, Iron Chains) and Cadastre (1961; translated, 1973).\nThe year that C\u00e9saire left the communist party coincides with his earliest experiment in drama, Et les chiens se taisaient (published and broadcast 1956; translated as And the Dogs Were Silent, 1990). C\u00e9saire turned to theater in an effort to make his literary themes more accessible. His plays oscillate between lyricism, realism, and allegory, manipulating the conventions of the theater to provide a commentary on the politics of racism, colonialism, and decolonization.\nEt les chiens se taisaient is adapted from a long poem of the same title that appeared at the end of Les armes miraculeuses; hence, the play clearly marks C\u00e9saire\u2019s transition from poetry to theater. According to Davis, C\u00e9saire described this work as a \u201clyric oratorio.\u201d The play features the surrealism of his poetry and is difficult to stage. Et les chiens se taisaient was aired as a radio drama in France, but unlike later plays, it has not enjoyed revivals. Nevertheless, it was an important precursor to C\u00e9saire\u2019s later theatrical works, featuring many recurring themes: anger against colonial power; the painful memories of slavery and the middle passage; placing the West Indies within a global pan-African context; and the impossible situation of Black political leadership in the age of decolonization.\nEt les chiens se taisaient features two highly distinct styles of speech. The dense, lyrical monologues of C\u00e9saire\u2019s postcolonial hero, the Rebel, and the other Caribbean characters contrast with the rhetorically calculating style of the white colonial executives. The play also demonstrates C\u00e9saire\u2019s mastery of ancient mythology and classical dramatic traditions, drawing consciously on the myth of Osiris and Aeschylean tragedy. Additionally, as throughout C\u00e9saire\u2019s writing, dogs have a complex symbolic function. Barking dogs evoke slave masters, who used dogs against rebellious slaves; however, the image of the dog is also linked with the Egyptian god Anubis, described by Gregson Davis as \u201ca dog-headed deity who presided over cemeteries.\u201d C\u00e9saire employs both aspects of canine imagery in this play, which centers on the death of the Rebel, C\u00e9saire\u2019s first dramatic model for the postcolonial revolutionary leader.\nThe beginning of the play kills much of the suspense, as the Echo (which, like the Chorus, supplies commentary on the play\u2019s events) informs the audience that \u201cBien s\u00fbr qu\u2019il va mourir le Rebelle\u201d (the Rebel will surely die). Moving the scene to a colonial prison, C\u00e9saire re-creates the appropriation of the island by the French, the horrors of the slave trade, and the arrival of white colonial bureaucrats, all through the exchange of voices among two narrators (one male and one female), madwomen, bishops, and a colonial administrator. Then the chorus reenacts a scene of Black revolution, marked by \u201cchants monotones et sauvages, pi\u00e9tinements confus\u201d (wild and monotonous chants, confused stamping of feet), and rowdies crying for death to the whites. It is in this chaotic atmosphere that the Rebel emerges, depicted through the imagery of Osiris, with a dog\u2019s head and sandals resembling pale suns on his feet. As Davis explains, writers of the Negritude movement appropriated \u201cEgyptian culture as \u2018black,\u2019\u201d and thus C\u00e9saire foregrounds the Osiris and Anubis myths rather than the Christian myths many critics have located in the play.\nThe second act of Et les chiens se taisaient focuses on the isolation of the Rebel, who explains that his participation in the slave revolt was motivated by his desire for equality. He imagines the world as a forest, with trees of different woods growing together in harmony. However, his refusal to be a slave was realized through violent means, and he accepts responsibility for joining\u2014despite his denial of racial hatred\u2014the cry of \u201cMort aux Blancs\u201d (death to the whites). His mother and lover urge him to reject death, which would necessitate a tacit acceptance of colonial authority. The Rebel rejects the urging of both women, who, like other Black women in C\u00e9saire\u2019s plays, represent compromise in the name of survival. Act 3 returns to the prison, where the Rebel is increasingly weakened as he is beaten by the jailer and his wife, who mock the juxtaposition of black skin and red blood. The tone of the play\u2014and of the Rebel\u2019s monologues in particular\u2014becomes increasingly apocalyptic and hallucinatory. Tom-toms beat as the play moves backward into an African cultural past. As the two narrators indicate, the Rebel dies in the middle of growing, fecund plants and flowers. With the death of the Rebel, the Echo\u2019s assertion at the beginning of the play is realized, but there are hints of a possible rebirth.\nAlthough Et les chiens se taisaient is a political play, its critiques remain largely on the level of allegory and are deliberately obscure. In contrast, C\u00e9saire\u2019s next dramatic efforts, the plays of his explicitly \u201cpolitical triptych,\u201d comment more directly on specific historical situations of the 1950s and 1960s, especially in the context of postcolonial nationhood, leadership, and identity. The first of these plays, La Trag\u00e9die du roi Christophe, is also the first of C\u00e9saire\u2019s plays to be written expressly for the theater. It was directed by the avant-gardist Jean-Marrie Serreau, who, as Davis reports, \u201cmaster-minded the premi\u00e8re production at the Salzburg festival\u201d in 1964 \u201cand subsequently took it to the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l\u2019Od\u00e9on in Paris.\u201d C\u00e9saire\u2019s relationships with French left-wing intellectuals and artists Michel Leiris and Pablo Picasso helped the play circumvent bureaucratic obstacles, and it was a huge success. It was performed in North America, Europe, and Africa, and it was restaged at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise in 1991 under the government of French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand.\nIn La Trag\u00e9die du roi Christophe, C\u00e9saire provides an ironic commentary on postcolonial leadership, beginning a critique that he develops further in Une Saison au Congo. Throughout the drama he explores the fallacy of colonial imitation of the m\u00e9tropole (that is, France) as the protagonist, Christophe, moves from an emulation of French royalty to an embrace of his African roots that occurs only as he nears death.\nThe play opens with a cockfight whose participants are Christophe and P\u00e9tion, named after the rulers of divided Haiti in the early 19th century. A commentator describes the Haitian Revolution, in which Christophe served as a general under Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture. Christophe is appointed the president of the republic, but he abandons the city of Port-au-Prince to P\u00e9tion and the mulatto class, establishing himself as a king in the northern region of Haiti. C\u00e9saire thus begins to demonstrate how swiftly the ideals of the revolution can be betrayed. From the beginning of the play Christophe\u2019s character vacillates between his commitment to Black freedom and his embrace of the legacy of Black slavery and exploitation in Haiti. Christophe attests to his countrymen that \u201cde noms de gloire je veux couvrir vos noms d\u2019esclaves\u201d (with names of glory I will cover your slave names), vowing to reclaim a Black identity erased by slavery. Meanwhile, he wants to build a citadel as a symbol of freed Haiti but, ironically, can only do so by putting demands on his workers reminiscent of slavery. C\u00e9saire makes it clear that Christophe\u2019s drives, imitative of white oppression, are part of his undoing.\nIn Acts 2 and 3, the optimism at first associated with Christophe\u2019s leadership rapidly dissipates. One of the ladies of the court realizes that Christophe\u2019s path to liberty closely resembles the path to slavery, \u201cSi bien que celle de la libert\u00e9 et celle de l\u2019esclavage se confondraient\u201d (So well that those of liberty and slavery could be mistaken for each other). It soon emerges that Christophe, despite his desire for Black freedom, is deeply invested in the logic and rhetoric of slavery. As he forcibly marries a group of men and women, his language begins to resemble that of a slave master as he praises the bodies of the women and their potential for work. Obsessed by fears of betrayal, Christophe orders the death of Archbishop Brelle, who threatens to expose the growing corruption in Haiti. Then, as labor continues on the citadel\u2014work the stage directions compare with the building of the pyramids\u2014a storm strikes Christophe\u2019s garrison and treasury; here, as in Une Temp\u00eate, a storm symbolizes an impending social and political crisis. This crisis comes to a head in the progressively surreal third act. At a lavish state event, Christophe brings in five African men dressed in their native country\u2019s robes. He claims to have bought them from a slave ship and purchased their freedom. However, as Christophe parades the Africans through the court, it becomes clear that he has only perpetuated their enslavement. During the Feast of the Assumption, which celebrates the ascension of the Virgin Mary into heaven, the ghost of Brelle appears in the church and curses Christophe, who collapses, paralyzed. As the play draws to a close, Christophe appears as a mad, old, feeble king, betrayed by his own soldiers, and with his people in revolt. Invoking Africa and speaking in Creole, Christophe commits suicide.\nChristophe\u2019s political agent, Hugonin, appears alone on stage after Christophe\u2019s death. In evening clothes, Hugonin apologizes for his lateness and drunkenness. He then reveals himself to be Baron Samedi, the voodoo god associated with death and funerals. Here C\u00e9saire suggests that under the veneer of Frenchness and officiality associated with Hugonin there lies an authentic vestige of Haitian culture. Both Hugonin and Christophe have repressed their African and Caribbean heritages beneath a veneer of Frenchness with similarly tragic results. For C\u00e9saire, the task of the postcolonial writer is to synthesize these heritages.\nThe second play of C\u00e9saire\u2019s political triptych is Une Saison au Congo, which recounts the rise, fall, and assassination of Congolese political leader Patrice Lumumba. Published in 1965, the play recounts the Congo\u2019s declaration of independence from Belgian colonial rule, its rise to independence as Zaire under the leadership of Lumumba, and its neocolonial subjection under the ambitious but corrupt Mokutu, a thinly veiled portrayal of Mobutu S\u00e9s\u00e9 Seko, the former president of Zaire. The play\u2019s topical nature affected its production history: as Davis reports, the Belgian authorities tried to suppress the production of the play, which was first staged in Brussels. C\u00e9saire\u2019s supporters among the intellectuals of Paris intervened and, according to Davis, \u201csucceeded in circumventing these obstacles.\u201d When the play was staged in Paris under the direction of avant-garde director Serreau, Davis claims that it \u201cprovoked unease\u201d among the \u201ceducated Zairean population.\u201d\nThe title of the play carries a double purpose: it makes clear that the true subject matter of the play is not simply that of the tragic hero Lumumba but the tragedy of the Congo and all of its people. Additionally, the title associates the Congo with hell through its allusion to Arthur Rimbaud\u2019s prose poem Une Saison en enfer (1873; translated as \u201cA Season in Hell,\u201d 1931). C\u00e9saire introduces his audience to the Congo/ hell through Lumumba, who begins the play as a bonimenteur (beer seller). By beginning with the image of Lumumba selling beer, C\u00e9saire exploits the irony of politics as salesmanship. As he tells the audience that \u201cle bock de bi\u00e8re est d\u00e9sormais le symbole de notre droit congolais et de nos libert\u00e9s congolaises\u201d (in the Congo a mug of beer is the symbol of all our rights and liberties), Lumumba emphasizes the artificial nature of rights under colonialism. Here, as in Une Temp\u00eate, C\u00e9saire emphasizes how colonizers bring the pleasures of alcohol, which is a means for keeping a subject population in its place. The introductory scene also foregrounds the gender politics of the play when a heckler cries that Polar Beer, the brand of beer Lumumba is selling, threatens to make men impotent. Lumumba\u2019s appeal to the women in the audience to disprove that claim underscores his masculine authority. The scene also introduces a sanza (mbira) player, who like a wandering Greek chorus figure, comments on events. For example, as the Belgian police watch Lumumba with concern, the sanza player, whom they dismiss as a \u201cnuisance,\u201d sings \u201cAta-ndele\u201d (Sooner or Later).\nAs the play depicts Lumumba\u2019s rise to power, it reveals the colonial and neocolonial forces working to undercut the Congo\u2019s bid for independence. C\u00e9saire uses poetic form to underscore the control colonial forces exercise over the fate of the newly independent state. In caricatures of a series of bankers, the dialogue moves into sustained rhymed couplets; in their speeches, the bankers make it clear that avarice and economic corruption will cause the downfall of the free Congo\u2019s leaders. In contrast, Lumumba\u2019s long monologue evoking the Congo as both mother and child, perhaps the most beautiful of the play, is written in lyrical free verse.\nC\u00e9saire next exposes the false rhetoric of the \u201ccivilizing mission\u201d the Belgian colonizers used to justify their appropriation of the Congo: the departing president reminds the crowd that King Leopold came to the Congo in the name of civilization rather than diamonds or gold mines. Then C\u00e9saire expands his critique of the colonizers to include both the ostensibly neutral forces of the United Nations, embodied in the character of Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, and those of the \u201cAmbassadeur Grand Occidental,\u201d a figure for American political power. The Ambassador justifies his country\u2019s authority through the belief that it is the watchdog of the world and has a particular mandate to guard against Communism. Underscoring the American role in the tragedy of the Congo, C\u00e9saire radicalizes the argument of the play, moving past the conflict between colonizer and colonized to mete out global culpability.\nThe last two acts of Une Saison au Congo chart the political fall of Lumumba and, ultimately, his murder. Act 2 demonstrates how rapidly Lumumba\u2019s authority is threatened by outside forces as well as by competition within the newly independent Congo. Lumumba is betrayed by those he trusts the most, especially his soldier and supporter Mokutu. He is also denied use of the radio to communicate with his people, which C\u00e9saire, like fellow Martinican intellectual and contributor to Pr\u00e9sence africaine Fanon, identifies as central to the effectiveness of resistance movements. Having distributed the responsibility for Lumumba\u2019s downfall onto the range of forces established in act 1, in the third act C\u00e9saire has an unnamed white mercenary serve as Lumumba\u2019s murderer. At this juncture the play goes from being realistic to increasingly impressionistic. Hammarskj\u00f6ld, Mokutu, and Lumumba\u2019s other enemies step onstage to admit their complicity in Lumumba\u2019s death.\nThe original edition of the play ends on a slightly optimistic note: the final moments take place at the Independence Day celebrations in Kinshasa. Although Mokutu, lacking Lumumba\u2019s natural eloquence, harangues the audience, it is the sanza player who has the last word, exhorting the newly independent nation, and its leaders, to \u201cgrow straight\u201d and \u201cto keep it clean.\u201d However, C\u00e9saire added a scene for the 1973 edition of the play in which Mokutu admits his betrayal of Lumumba and openly acknowledges his manipulation of the people of the newly independent Congo. This ending is much darker than the original. After Mokutu exhorts the crowd, he bids his soldiers to fire into the throng, killing the sanza player and others. As the smoke dissipates, Mokutu leaves the stage. With the new ending C\u00e9saire offers an increasingly skeptical perspective on neocolonial power: with the rise of the dictator, a new reign of terror has begun. Hence, C\u00e9saire\u2019s use of the indefinite article in the play\u2019s title, which corresponds to the indefinite article in the last play of C\u00e9saire\u2019s triptych, Une Temp\u00eate: Lumumba\u2019s rise and fall is just one season of many in the Congo\u2019s struggle for freedom, just as the \u201ctempest\u201d of the third play\u2019s title is only one storm of many in the history of colonial confrontation.\nThe title page of Une Temp\u00eate announces its revisionary relationship with Shakespeare\u2019s play The Tempest and its overturning of what Pallister calls the \u201cmaster-slave dynamic\u201d of that play: \u201cd\u2019apr\u00e8s \u2018la Temp\u00eate\u2019 de Shakespeare\u2014Adaptation pour un th\u00e9\u00e2tre n\u00e8gre\u201d (according to The Tempest of Shakespeare\u2014An Adaptation for Black Theater). C\u00e9saire\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cblack theater\u201d is significant in its claim for a Black transnational identity. The play makes reference to the postcolonial relations of the French Caribbean and the m\u00e9tropole; the postcolonial struggles of Africa; and the struggles of the Black Power and Civil Rights movements in the United States. With this play C\u00e9saire argues for a diasporic Black identity that works to reverse the stifling binary of colonizer and colonized.\nIn contrast to Une Saison au Congo, which is largely realist in style, Une Temp\u00eate establishes itself as self-consciously theatrical from the beginning. Le Meneur du jeu (the Master of Ceremonies) enters the stage, inviting each actor to take up his own character and mask. Nature is identified as a vital character in the play, and the storm and the wind are invited to take up their own parts. By beginning the play in this manner, C\u00e9saire inverts the culture/nature dyad endemic to colonialism: not only are humans unable to control nature, but they are equal to nature as performers in the drama. Significantly, when Prospero enters the stage, he reminds Miranda that the shipwreck they are witnessing is only a play.\nC\u00e9saire revises, racializes, and politicizes the relationships Shakespeare creates among Prospero, Ariel, and Caliban. Ariel is characterized as a mulatto slave, while Caliban is a Black slave. By figuring Ariel as a mulatto, C\u00e9saire presents him as an ambivalent intermediary between white and Black and colonizer and colonized, representing the position of the mulatto class in the Martinique of C\u00e9saire\u2019s upbringing. Caliban, on the other hand, is presented as a Black nationalist: he enters the stage crying \u201cUhuru,\u201d the Swahili word for \u201cfreedom.\u201d C\u00e9saire depicts the relationship between Prospero and Caliban as analogous to that between the colonizer and colonized as portrayed in Une saison au Congo: Prospero congratulates himself for having given Caliban language, yet characterizes him as an ape. Caliban, however, understands the gift of language in an explicitly anticolonial and ironic manner: \u201cTu ne m\u2019as rien appris du tout. Sauf, bien s\u00fbr, \u00e0 baragouiner ton langage pour comprende tes ordres\u201d (You didn\u2019t teach me a thing. Except to jabber in your own language so that I could understand your orders).\nC\u00e9saire introduces an element of environmental anticolonialism as well: Caliban says to Prospero, \u201ctu crois que la terre est chose Mort ... C\u2019est tellement commode! Morte, alors on la pi\u00e9tine, on la souille, on la foule d\u2019un pied vanqueur\u201d (you think the earth is dead ... it\u2019s so much simpler that way! Dead, you can walk on it, pollute it, you can tread upon it with the steps of a conqueror). As in Une Saison au Congo, in which Lumumba characterizes the Congo as both mother and child, here the land is both feminized and personified, and to respect the land implies a rejection of the patriarchal and hierarchical objectives of colonial power.\nWhere Shakespeare\u2019s play makes Prospero the sorcerer, in C\u00e9saire\u2019s play Caliban also has the powers of sorcery. C\u00e9saire presents Caliban as agent in the relationship rather than simply a slave: Prospero has given Caliban language, and Caliban teaches Prospero about the natural world of the island. Caliban is also linked with the destructive forces of nature, invoking the thunder god Shango to increase his power. The initial conflict between the two characters staged in act 1 concludes with Caliban\u2019s renunciation of his colonial identity and claiming the radical identity of Black nationalism: \u201cAppelle-moi X ... l\u2019homme dont on a vol\u00e9 le nom\u201d (Call me X ... a man whose history has been stolen). All of Caliban\u2019s dialogue with Prospero make use of tu, the familiar second-person pronoun, which means that Caliban addresses his ostensible master as an equal. Ariel, however, uses the vous form, underscoring his inability to reject his master and his liminal position between colonizer and colonized.\nAs the play progresses, C\u00e9saire further alters Shakespeare\u2019s original by demystifying the love relationship between Fernando and Miranda; Fernando cheats Miranda at cards, claiming that his deceptions will provide her a good introduction to the less innocent world she will encounter upon leaving the island. However, Fernando and Miranda disappear from the plot shortly before the play\u2019s conclusion.\nC\u00e9saire continues emphasizing the play\u2019s racial politics with the Shakespearean fools Stephano and Trinculo, who both wish to turn Caliban into a museum piece and exhibit him in Europe. Such abuses not only happened during Shakespeare\u2019s lifetime, but throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries many colonial subjects had been turned into museum exhibits and freak shows. Finally, the play moves toward a reversal of the colonial binary. Prospero\u2019s staging of a performance of the Roman gods\u2014ostensibly to instruct his daughter and future son-in-law in beauty and harmony\u2014is disrupted by the entrance of the African god Eshu, the priapic trickster god who signifies reversal in ancient African cultures. Ultimately, Caliban and Prospero stay together on the island, but not until Caliban makes an impassioned speech for his freedom. As the play nears its close, Caliban and Prospero seem locked in unresolvable conflict, as Caliban damns the colonial enterprise, and Prospero vows to fight back. In the brief final speech, which occurs after the curtain is half-raised to indicate the passage of time, Prospero appears physically aged and weary. Despite his efforts to defend civilization on the island, it appears that nature is winning; the island is overrun with animals, and even the climate has changed. Just as C\u00e9saire begins the play by making storm and wind active characters in the drama, he ends the play by suggesting that nature has overwhelmed even the force of colonial power.\nAfter 1970 C\u00e9saire published another volume of poetry, Moi, laminaire (1982, I, Laminary) and several more political and historical essays. In 1982 Mitterrand appointed him president of the regional council for the French d\u00e9partements d\u2019outremer (Overseas Departments), a position that allowed him to encourage the economic and cultural development of his native Martinique. In 1993 he retired from national political life in Paris to Fort-de-France, Martinique, which acknowledged the island\u2019s debt to a great champion of its liberation and culture with a municipal celebration of his 19th birthday in 2003.\nPallister has stated that Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire\u2019s writing \u201cexpresses the need for revolution, for change in a flawed and prejudiced world.\u201d All of his plays, especially the triptych, draw on history, African myth, and European literature to create a portrait of the Caribbean that both avows the damage done by capitalism and colonialism and underlines the difficulty of achieving liberation from this legacy. The latter problem is indicated in the fact that neither C\u00e9saire nor his characters choose to speak Creole in a sustained way. Additionally, each play offers a version of the postcolonial Black male intellectual coming of age and taking responsibility for his people but hesitating to cut ties with France. C\u00e9saire\u2019s move from poet to dramatist at the time when he broke his ties with the Communist Party in the 1950s was motivated, in Davis\u2019s words, \u201cby a sincere desire on his part to narrow the gap in communication between avant-garde writer and provincial audience,\u201d to reach the Martinican people with his vision of Caribbean civilization through a literary form more accessible than his poetry. Thus, C\u00e9saire\u2019s plays continue to be performed and studied as both political activism and popular theater.\nC\u00e9saire died in Martinique on April 17, 2008.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Caribbean"]}}
