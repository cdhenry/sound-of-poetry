An advocate of the avant garde, Stein helped shape an artistic movement that demanded a novel form of expression and a conscious break with the past. The Paris salon at 27 rue de Fleurus that she shared with Alice B. Toklas, her lifelong companion and secretary, became a gathering place for the \u201cnew moderns,\u201d as the talented young artists supporting this movement came to be called. Among those whose careers she helped launch were painters Henri Matisse, Juan Gris, and Pablo Picasso. What these creators achieved in the visual arts, Stein attempted in her writing. A bold experimenter and self-proclaimed genius, she rejected the linear, time-oriented writing characteristic of the 19th century for a spatial, process-oriented, specifically 20th-century literature. The results were dense poems and fictions, often devoid of plot or dialogue, which yielded memorable phrases (\u201cRose is a rose is a rose\u201d) but were not commercially successful books. In fact, her only bestseller,\u00a0The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas,\u00a0a memoir of Stein\u2019s life written in the person of Toklas, was a standard narrative, conventionally composed.\n\r\nThough commercial publishers slighted her experimental writings and critics dismissed them as incomprehensible, Stein\u2019s theories did interest some of the most talented writers of the day. During the years between World War I and World War II, a steady stream of expatriate American and English writers, whom Stein dubbed \u201cthe Lost Generation,\u201d found their way to her soirees.\u00a0Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Sherwood Anderson were among those exposed to her literary quest for what she called an \u201cexact description of inner and outer reality.\u201d Whether or not Stein influenced these and other major modern writers\u2014including\u00a0James Joyce, whose masterpiece of modernist writing,\u00a0Ulysses,\u00a0was composed after his exposure to Stein\u2014remains an issue of some contention. Critics do agree, however, that whatever her influence, her own work, and particularly her experimental writing, is largely neglected. As Edmund Wilson wrote in\u00a0Axel\u2019s Castle: A Study in the Imaginative Literature of 1870-1930, \u201cMost of us balk at her soporific rigmaroles, her echolaliac incantations, her half-witted-sounding catalogues of numbers; most of us read her less and less. Yet, remembering especially her early work, we are still always aware of her presence in the background of contemporary literature.\u201d\n\r\nIf Stein\u2019s importance as a literary figure has largely been relegated to a secondary role, her influence as a personality should not be underestimated. She was an imposing figure, possessed of a remarkable self-confidence and a commanding manner. When couples came to visit her salon, Stein typically entertained the men, while shuttling the wives off to sit with Toklas. Writing in the\u00a0Dictionary of Literary Biography,\u00a0James R. Mellow suggested that Stein\u2019s unconventional lifestyle and \u201cher openness to vanguard trends may have been encouraged by her erratic family life.\u201d\n\r\nBorn in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, in 1874, Stein moved frequently and was exposed to three different languages before mastering one. When she was six months old, her parents took her and her two older brothers, Michael and Leo, abroad for a five-year European sojourn. Upon their return, they settled in Oakland, California, where Stein grew up. At 18, she followed her brother Leo to Baltimore, and while he attended Harvard, she enrolled in the Harvard Annex (renamed Radcliffe College before she graduated). At this time Stein\u2019s primary interest was the study of psychology under noted psychologist William James. With his encouragement, she published two research papers in the Harvard\u00a0Psychological Review\u00a0and enrolled in the Johns Hopkins Medical School. After failing several courses, Stein quit the program without earning a degree. Instead she followed Leo first to London, and then to Paris, where he had settled early in 1903 to pursue a career as an artist. \u201cParis was the place,\u201d Stein is quoted in Gilbert A. Harrison\u2019s\u00a0Gertrude Stein\u2019s America, \u201cthat suited us who were to create the twentieth century art and literature.\u201d\n\r\nAs soon as she arrived, Stein submerged herself in the bohemian community of the avant garde, described by her brother Leo as an \u201catmosphere of propaganda.\u201d With guidance from her eldest brother Michael\u2014an art collector who lived just a few blocks away\u2014Stein began to amass a modern art collection of her own. She also, at age 29, dedicated herself in earnest to her writing.\n\r\nStein published her first\u2014and some say her best\u2014book in 1909.\u00a0Three Lives\u00a0is comprised of three short tales, each of which investigates the essential nature of its main character. Of these, \u201cMelanctha,\u201d the portrait of a young mulatto girl who suffers an unhappy affair with a black doctor, has been particularly singled out for praise. A reworking of an autobiographical story Stein wrote about an unhappy lesbian affair, the story \u201cattempts to trace the curve of a passion, its rise, its climax, its collapse, with all the shifts and modulations between dissension and reconciliation along the way,\u201d wrote Mark Schorer in\u00a0The World We Imagine.\u00a0\n\r\nThe dialogue and other facets of the story reflect the influence of Stein\u2019s psychological training under James. \u201cThe identity of her characters as it is revealed in unconscious habits and rhythms of speech, the classification of all possible character types, and the problem of laying out as a continuous present knowledge that had accumulated over a period of time\u201d\u2014all are Jamesian questions that surface in the tale, according to Meredith Yearsley in the\u00a0Dictionary of Literary Biography.\u00a0Since few\u2014if any\u2014writers had ever isolated these themes in this particular manner, the work remains significant. \u201cBoth for historical reasons and for intrinsic merit, \u2018Melanctha\u2019 must be ranked as one of the three or four thoroughly original short stories which have been produced in this century,\u201d Oscar Cargill concluded in his\u00a0Intellectual America.\n\r\nAs she developed her craft, Stein became more experimental in her writing. Since her works were not published in the order in which they were composed, it is difficult to chart the progression of her experiments, but critics marked\u00a0The Making of Americans: Being a History of a Family\u2019s Progress\u00a0(written between 1906-1908 and published in 1925) as a milestone. A 900-page novel without dialogue or action, the book held no commercial interest and went unpublished for 17 years. It began as a chronicle of a representative family and evolved into a history of the entire human race, reflecting both Stein\u2019s interest in psychology and her obsession with the process of experience. Not trusting narration to convey the complexity of human behavior, Stein employed description to achieve what she called \u201ca continuous present.\u201d She compared the technique to a motion picture camera, which freezes action into separate frames. Though no two frames are exactly alike, when viewed in sequence they present a flowing continuity.\n\r\nKatherine\u00a0Anne Porter, writing a critique of\u00a0The Making of Americans,\u00a0compared the experience of reading the book to walking into \u201ca great spiral, a slow, ever-widening, unmeasured spiral unrolling itself horizontally. The people in this world appear to be motionless at every stage of their progress, each one is simultaneously being born, arriving at all ages and dying. You perceive that it is a world without mobility, everything takes place, has taken place, will take place; therefore nothing takes place, all at once.\u201d Porter maintained that such writing was not based upon moral or intellectual judgments but simply upon Stein\u2019s observations of \u201cacts, words, appearances giving her view; limited, personal in the extreme, prejudiced without qualification, based on assumptions founded in the void of pure unreason.\u201d In his\u00a0I Hear America,\u00a0Vernon Loggins described Stein\u2019s language as \u201cthought in the nude\u2014not thought dressed up in the clothes of time-worn rhetoric.\u201d Mark Schorer also noted her process-oriented approach: \u201cHer model now is Picasso in his cubist phase and her ambition a literary plasticity divorced from narrative sequence and consequence and hence from literary meaning. She was trying to transform literature from a temporal into a purely spatial art, to use words for their own sake alone.\u201d\n\r\nStein carried this technique even further in\u00a0Tender Buttons: Objects, Food, Rooms.\u00a0Published at her own expense, the book contains passages of automatic writing and is configured as a series of paragraphs about objects. Devoid of logic, narration, and conventional grammar, it resembles a verbal collage. \u201cTender Buttons\u00a0is to writing \u2026 exactly, what cubism is to art,\u201d wrote W.G. Rogers in\u00a0When This You See Remember Me: Gertrude Stein in Person. \u201cBoth book and picture appeared in, belong to, can\u2019t be removed from our time. That particular quality in them which is usually ridiculed, the disparate, the dispersed, the getting onto a horse and riding off in all directions, the atomization of their respective materials, the distorted vision, all that was not imagined but rather drawn out of their unique age. If the twentieth century makes sense, so do Stein and Picasso.\u201d Despite its inaccessibility, Rogers called\u00a0Tender Buttons \u201cessential, for here is the kind of Stein that launched a thousand jibes; this represents the big break with the sort of books to which we had been accustomed, and once you have succumbed to it, you can take anything, you have become a Stein reader.\u201d\n\r\nStein explains the theory behind her techniques in\u00a0Composition as Explanation.\u00a0But even those critics who understood her approach were largely skeptical of her ability to reduce language to abstraction and still use it in a way that had meaning to anyone beyond herself. As\u00a0Alfred\u00a0Kazin noted in the\u00a0Reporter, \u201cshe let the stream of her thoughts flow as if a book were only a receptacle for her mind. \u2026 But the trouble with these pure thinkers in art, criticism, and psychology is that the mind is always an instrument, not its own clear-cut subject matter.\u201d When Stein did embrace conventional subjects, as she did in her memoir,\u00a0The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas,\u00a0she was a resounding success.\n\nThe Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\u00a0recounts Stein\u2019s experiences in the colorful art world of Paris between the world wars. It was written by Stein from Toklas\u2019s point of view, a technique that \u201cenables Miss Stein to write about herself while pretending she is someone dearly devoted to herself,\u201d said\u00a0New Outlook\u00a0contributor Robert Cantwell. Notwithstanding the enormous egotism behind the endeavor, readers flocked to the publication (which was to be Stein\u2019s only bestseller), fascinated by the vivid portrait of a genuinely creative world. As Ralph Thompson noted in\u00a0Current History, \u201cThe style is artful, consciously naive, at times pompous, but it is never boring or obscure, and is often highly amusing.\u00a0The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\u00a0should convince even the most skeptical that Miss Stein is gifted and has something to say.\u201d\n\r\nIn addition to writing books, Stein also contributed librettos to several operas by Virgil Thompson, notably\u00a0Four Saints in Three Acts\u00a0and\u00a0The Mother of Us All.\u00a0The year after her autobiography appeared, Stein returned to the United States to celebrate the successful staging of\u00a0Four Saints\u00a0at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut, and to conduct a lecture tour. Though she had been absent for 30 years, Stein was treated royally and her return was front page news in the major daily papers. She described her six-month visit in a second memoir,\u00a0Everybody\u2019s Autobiography.\u00a0Her tour completed, Stein returned to France where she remained for the rest of her life, though she moved from Paris to a village near the Swiss border during World War II. Many of her later writings took the war as a subject, notably\u00a0Brewsie and Willie,\u00a0which sought to capture the life of common American soldiers through their speech.\n\nA History of Having a Great Many Times Not Continued to Be Friends: The Correspondence between Mabel Dodge and Gertrude Stein, 1911-1934\u00a0follows the relationship of the two women, who met only a few times, through their letters, collected by editor Patricia R. Everett. The pair met in Paris in 1911, and when Stein did spend time with Dodge at her Italian villa, she was inspired to write\u00a0Portrait of Mabel Dodge at the Villa Curonia,\u00a0which\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0contributor Julie Martin called \u201can impressionistic linking of vivid images suggesting the physical, emotional, and sexual goings-on at the villa, in particular Dodge\u2019s late-night trysts with her son\u2019s young tutor.\u201d Martin noted that Dodge\u2019s memoirs hint at \u201csome highly charged flirting\u201d between Dodge and Stein. Dodge married four times and, in addition to Stein, she hosted Bernard Berenson in Europe, as well as Alfred Stieglitz, Lincoln Steffens, Carl Van Vechten, and her former lover John Reed, in New York. When she moved to Taos, New Mexico, her guests included psychoanalyst Carl Jung, and writers Thornton Wilder, Willa Cather, and Frieda and D.H. Lawrence. \u00a0\n\r\nWhen Dodge moved to New York, she was instrumental in bringing modern art to the American public. She offered for sale at her 1913 exhibition an issue of the magazine\u00a0Art and Decoration,\u00a0which contained an article in which Dodge compared Stein\u2019s writing to Picasso\u2019s cubism. Some, including Dodge, have speculated that their friendship cooled because of jealousy on the part of Toklas, but differences of opinion on how to promote Stein\u2019s writing in the United States may have had more to do with their deteriorating relationship. Dodge did not approve of Stein\u2019s choice of publishers, calling the house \u201cabsolutely third rate.\u201d Their correspondence slowed, and Stein ignored Dodge\u2019s invitation to her marriage to Native American Tony Luhan, whose culture Dodge had adopted after her move to Taos. The women last had contact in 1934.\n\r\nTwo collections of Stein\u2019s work were published as\u00a0Gertrude Stein: Writings 1903-1932\u00a0and\u00a0Gertrude Stein: Writings 1932-1946.\u00a0Richard Howard\u00a0wrote in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0that \u201c\u2018America is my country and Paris is my hometown,\u2019 Stein used to say, and this great haul of her works in every imaginable genre (and some unimaginable) certainly constitutes the indemnification of an exile and the reward of a homecoming.\u201d\n\r\nIn the 1980s, a cabinet in Yale University\u2019s Beinecke Library was unlocked, making public for the first time a collection of Stein\u2019s papers, including 300 love notes written by Stein and Toklas. Editor Kay Turner collected the best of these and published them as\u00a0Baby Precious Always Shines: Selected Love Notes between Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas.\u00a0Most of the notes were written by Stein for Toklas, whom she called \u201cBaby Precious,\u201d who in turn called Stein \u201cMr. Cuddle-Wuddle.\u201d The notes reveal nearly 40 years of poetic declarations of affection, and details of their intimacy. A\u00a0Kirkus Reviews\u00a0contributor wrote that \u201cthe collection makes a convincing case for Toklas\u2019s assertion that \u2018notes are a very beautiful form of literature,\u2019 personal, provocative, and tender.\u201d\n\r\nRemembered today largely as an interesting personality whose works are seldom read, Gertrude Stein nonetheless has left her stamp upon modern literature. As\u00a0John Ashbery\u00a0wrote in\u00a0ARTnews, \u201cHer structures may be demolished; what remains is a sense of someone\u2019s having built.\u201d She died in 1946, and her work has grown in prominence ever since.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
