The daughter of a concert violinist, she stopped writing poetry for ten years to devote herself to classical piano. In an interview with Kate Greenstreet, Lindsay stated, \u201cOver time\u2014and this is still true\u2014I found that I couldn't keep both music and poetry going with the seriousness that each required. \u2026 Looking back, I realize that, to me, the language of music had picked up where the language of words left off.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nLindsay\u2019s emotionally precise narratives explore themes of loss and growth with spare musicality. Lindsay is the author of several full-length collections of poetry, including Mayweed (2009), winner of the Washington Prize; Lamb (2006); and Where She Always Was (2004), which J. D. McClatchy chose for the May Swenson Award. Lindsay\u2019s poetry has also been featured on Verse Daily, Poetry Daily, and The Writer\u2019s Almanac with Garrison Keillor.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHer honors include the Missouri Review Prize, fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Massachusetts Cultural Council, and residencies at Yaddo, the MacDowell Colony, and the Millay Colony. She lives in Belmont, Massachusetts.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
