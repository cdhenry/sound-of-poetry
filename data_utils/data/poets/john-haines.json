In 1947, Haines bought a 160-acre homestead claim 80 miles outside of Fairbanks, Alaska, intending to pursue painting. According to Haines, when his paints froze, he turned to writing. His collections of poetry include Winter News (1966); The Stone Harp (1971); Cicada (1977); News from the Glacier: Selected Poems 1960-1980 (1982); New Poems 1980-1988 (1990), which received the Lenore Marshall Poetry Award and the Western States Book Award; The Owl in the Mask of the Dreamer: Collected Poems (1993); and For the Century\u2019s End: Poems 1990-1999 (2001), among others. His poems are noted for their stark, spare imagery, and evocative rendering of the brutal beauty of his adopted home. Poet Lawrence Raab noted the elemental character underlying Haines\u2019s verse: \u201cOne feels that the poet,\u201d Raab commented, \u201cthrough the act of the poem, is reaching toward something as basic and as necessary as food or shelter.\u201d\n\u00a0\r\nHaines\u2019s experiences trapping, hunting, and surviving as a homesteader in Alaska inform his work as a both a poet and essayist. According to Dana Gioia, \u201cWhile one might read his early poetry as a subjective record of the time, the most accessible account comes from his two books of essays, Living Off the Country (1981) and The Stars, the Snow, the Fire (1989). These superbly-written collections of mostly autobiographical prose reveal the importance of the dream-like solitude the empty Northern wilderness provided the author.\u201d Gioia went on to note that, \u201cby stepping out of the man-made rhythms of the city into the slower cycles of nature, Haines entered\u2014perhaps unknowingly at first\u2014a world of meditation. There are few overtly religious themes in Haines' writing, but both his poetry and prose are suffused with a sense of the sacred.\u201d Other collections of Haines\u2019s essays and autobiographical writing include Fables and Distances: New and Selected Essays (1996) and Descent (2010). Haines moved to San Diego in 1969, and lived in the lower 48 states for several years before returning to Alaska. He taught at numerous institutions including Ohio University, the University of Cincinnati, and George Washington University. Named a Fellow by the Academy of American Poets, his other honors and awards included two Guggenheim Fellowships, a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, an Amy Lowell Traveling Fellowship, the Alaska Governor\u2019s Award for Excellence in the Arts, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Library of Congress.\n\u00a0\nHarper\u2019s critic Hayden Carruth once described John Haines as \u201cone of our best nature poets, or for that matter one of the best nature writers of any kind.\u201d Though Haines is sometimes categorized as a regional writer, or an autobiographical poet, Gioia noted that his work eludes simple categorization: \u201cHe is an obstinately visionary poet,\u201d Gioia wrote of Haines, \u201cwho characteristically transforms individual experience into universal human terms. One would be tempted to call him a philosophic poet if his imagination were not so frequently mythic. He deals in serious ideas, but the concepts are not presented abstractly. They are revealed in bare narrative terms like ancient legends, half obscured by time.\u201d John Haines died in Fairbanks, Alaska, in 2011.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
