He set out on his career as a poet when he moved to Paris in 1910. Reverdy\u2019s financially supportive father died a year later, so the aspiring poet was forced to make a living through his writing. He published his first small volume of poetry, Poems en prose, in 1915, and he continued to write steadily thereafter. Gradually, Reverdy became known in literary circles, frequenting the avant-garde group consisting of such well-known artists and writers as Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris, and Georges Braque. With these and other artists, Reverdy developed cubism and surrealism. In 1917 he founded the monthly literary review Nord-Sud, which featured work by the first cubists and surrealists\u2014innovative writers such as Apollinaire, Jacob, Louis Aragon, Andr\u00e9\u00a0Breton, and Philippe Soupault. Reverdy\u2019s many subsequent poetry collections include Cravates de chanvre (1922), Coeur de chene (1921), La Guitare endormie (1919), Les Jockeys camoufles (1918), and La Lucarne ovale (1916).\nWhen the collection of his early poems, Les Epaves du ciel, appeared in 1924, Reverdy achieved greater recognition. The loneliness and spiritual apprehension that ran through his work attracted the surrealists, who praised him as the greatest living poet. Cubists admired the sharp visual acuity of his poems. Despite this influence by both modes of thought, Reverdy remained independent and cultivated his own unique voice. He endeavored to find \u201cthe sublime simplicity of true reality.\u201d His writing became more mystical; he aimed to uncover concealed truths. Soupault claimed that Reverdy, \u201cwith Paul Eluard, \u2026 is the purest of the writers of his time.\u201d\nReverdy became a Catholic, and in 1926, he retired to a life of ascetic seclusion near the Benedictine monastery at Solesmes in France. Maintaining his devotion to poetry and spirituality, he lived there until his death on June 17, 1960.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"]}}
