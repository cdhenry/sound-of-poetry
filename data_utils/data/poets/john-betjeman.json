He utilized traditional poetic forms, wrote with a light touch about public issues, celebrated classic architecture, and satirized much of contemporary society for his perception of its superficiality. \u201cModern \u2018progress\u2019 is anathema to him,\u201d Jocelyn Brooke wrote in Ronald Firbank and John Betjeman prior to Betjeman\u2019s death; \u201cthough fortunately for us [he] is still able to laugh.\u201d Brooke continued, \u201cPerhaps [Betjeman] can best be described as a writer who uses the medium of light verse for a serious purpose: not merely as a vehicle for satire or social commentary, but as a means of expressing a peculiar and specialized form of aesthetic emotion, in which nostalgia and humour are about equally blended.\u201d\nBetjeman\u2019s poetry was considered something of a phenomenon: it was read by a large audience and was also praised by literary critics. As Ralph J. Mills pointed out in Descant, \u201cBetjeman is a phenomenon in contemporary English literature, a truly popular poet. The sudden fame won by his Collected Poems ... brought him a wide reputation and made him quickly into a public personality.\u201d Betjeman was also admired by such poets and critics as Edmund Wilson and W.H. Auden, who dedicated his own The Age of Anxiety to his fellow poet. \u201cCertainly it is very rare in our day to see much accord between distinguished critics and poets on the one hand and the general public on the other,\u201d Mills would add; \u201cbut the very complexity of Betjeman\u2019s personality and feelings beneath the skillful though apparently simple surface of his verse probably unites, in whatever different kinds of levels of appreciation, the otherwise remote members of his audience.\u201d\n1958\u2019s Collected Poems first brought Betjeman into the popular limelight. Displaying the poet\u2019s skillful use of 19th-century poetic models, the collection was enthusiastically received by many critics. A Times Literary Supplement reviewer, for example, stated that Betjeman\u2019s poems were \u201ca pleasant change from the shapeless and unarticulated matter ... offered us by so many of his contemporaries. For Mr. Betjeman is a born versifier, ingenious and endlessly original; his echoes of Tennyson and Crabb, Praed and Father Prout, are never mere pastiche; and he is always attentive to the sound of his words, the run of his lines, the shape of his stanzas.\u201d T.J. Ross, however, found that although \u201chis ear is as flawless as Tennyson\u2019s and his effects sometimes as remarkable, Betjeman creates a world which, unlike the Victorians\u2019, is a miniature.\u201d Ross believed that when Betjeman involved the reader completely with his subject \u201cthe result [was] poor.\u201d Only when he kept the reader at a distance did he bring his work up to the level of \u201cfirst-rate minor art.\u201d But Louise Bogan had high praise for Betjeman\u2019s work: \u201cHis verse forms, elaborately varied, reproduce an entire set of neglected Victorian techniques, which he manipulates with the utmost dexterity and taste. His diction and his observation are delightfully fresh and original. And it is a pleasure to let down our defenses and be swept along by his anapaestic lines, with their bouncing unstressed syllables, and to meet no imperfect or false rhymes in the process; to recognize sentiment so delicately shaded, so sincerely felt, that it becomes immediately acceptable even to our modern sensibilities, grown used to the harsh, the violent, and the horrifying.\u201d\nIn Summoned by Bells (1960), Betjeman recreates his personal past in richly-detailed poems. Because the poet was able to recreate so accurately the time and place of his own childhood, Mills attributed to Betjeman \u201can almost Proustian memory.\u201d Walter Allen, writing in the New York Times Book Review, called Summoned by Bells an autobiography. But the collection, Allen explained, \u201ccan\u2019t be judged simply as the equivalent of an autobiographical novel. Whatever the final verdict on it may be, it is an extraordinarily accomplished, sustained exercise in narrative verse.\u201d Philip Larkin, in his review of the book for the Spectator, found that, although all the poems in the collection tell the poet\u2019s life story, Betjeman \u201cis not an egoist: rather, he is that rare thing, an extrovert sensitive. ... [Time] and again in scenes where interest might be expected to focus on the author\u2019s feelings we find it instead shifting to the details.\u201d Larkin concludes that \u201cBetjeman has an astonishing command of detail, both visual and circumstantial.\u201d\nThe poems from both High and Low (1967) and A Nip in the Air (1976) were included in the fourth edition of Betjeman\u2019s Collected Poems. Larkin, writing in his introduction to the volume, explained that Betjeman was a difficult poet for many critics to approach. \u201cBetjeman,\u201d he explained, \u201cconstitutes a kind of distorting mirror in which all our critical catch-phrases appear in gross unacceptable parody. He is committed, ambiguous, and ironic; he is conscious of literary tradition (but quotes the wrong authors); he is a satirist (but on the wrong side); he has his own White Goddess (in blazer and shorts). And he has done all those things such as forging a personal utterance, creating a private myth, bringing a new language and new properties to poetry, and even ... giving poetry back to the general reader, all equally undeniably, yet none of them in quite the way we meant. No wonder our keen critical tools twitch fretfully at his approach.\u201d\nAdditional verses, which Betjeman had chosen to omit from previous volumes and which some critics noted were of uneven quality, were collected as Uncollected Poems. This work was published in 1982, two years before the poet\u2019s death. While noting in a review of the work for The Times that Uncollected Poems contained some \u201cduds,\u201d John Carey added that it also included \u201cpoems no sensible reader will miss. The best of them touch on dying, that undying Betjeman bug-bear. Whatever his relations with contemporary life, he is unchallengeably the laureate of contemporary death, and has traced, in poem after poem, its horribly normal advance from the preliminary twinge ... to the fatal X-ray photographs and the hospital bed, conveniently placed for you to hear your relatives, in the car park below, making off cheerily to tea and telly.\u201d\nA sociable man who developed numerous close friendships with a variety of people over the years, Betjeman wrote many letters. His voluminous correspondence was collected in the two-volume Letters, published posthumously beginning in 1994. Edited by his daughter, Candida Lycett Green, Letters traces the poet\u2019s life through two periods: 1926 through 1951, and 1951 through 1984, the year of Betjeman\u2019s death. \u201cSomewhere in these two thick volumes,\u201d friend and critic Mark Girouard commented in the Times Literary Supplement, \u201cJohn Betjeman remarks that he wrote letters in order to avoid writing poems. ... To write letters ... so that the reading of them brings the writer into the room with one, is a rare gift, but Betjeman certainly had it.\u201d\nIn the London Review of Books, Patricia Beer commented on the element of humor that runs throughout the collected Letters. Listing the poet\u2019s \u201capparatus of mirth\u201d as \u201cOirish imitations, babytalk, spoof signatures, rustic voices, rebus writing, caricatures, doodles and so on,\u201d Beer noted that \u201cit too often sounds as though it needed oiling \u2026 Some will in any case find the jollity very much to their taste. Those who do not will have many and various sorts of seriousness, even melancholy, to choose from in this protean collection.\u201d\nBesides writing and editing several works on architecture, throughout his life Betjeman remained passionately involved in architectural preservation efforts. As he told Willa Petschek, he was most interested \u201cin saving groups of buildings of towns that can be ruined by \u2018a single frightful store that looks like a drive-in movie. The only way to prevent more and more ugly buildings going up ... is to draw people\u2019s attention to what\u2019s good in all periods.\u2019\u201d Betjeman made numerous appearances on television to promote preservation and became, as Petschek maintained, \u201ca cherished national cult.\u201d\nBetjeman championed such causes in his poetry as well; he wrote lovingly of the places of his childhood, of the buildings and monuments in danger of destruction. \u201cBetjeman\u2019s approach to architecture (which he values second only to poetry) enabled him to recognize the \u2018living force\u2019 of 19th-century buildings, especially the Victorian Gothic,\u201d Petschek noted. \u201cPartly through his verse and topographical writings, his guidebooks, poetry readings and TV appearances, but also through his warmth and peculiar genius for imparting enthusiasm for everything from rood screens to ladies\u2019 legs, he has made the public accept a rapid reversal in taste.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
