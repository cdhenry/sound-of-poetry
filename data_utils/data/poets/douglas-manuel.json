He earned his BA from Arizona State University and MFA from Butler University. His debut poetry collection, Testify (Red Hen Press, 2017), won an IBPA Benjamin Franklin Award for Poetry. Manuel\u2019s poems explore identity, race, and masculinity. Grounded in autobiography, his first book tracks a speaker struggling between worlds. In an interview with Sofia Bosch, Manuel remarks, \u201cI think the two biggest catalysts of Testify would be my mom\u2019s death when I was 8 and my father\u2019s long prison sentence. I was raised by my auntie \u2026 so, I was always kind of straddling those two worlds. I was always told when I was in the black space \u2026 I wasn\u2019t black enough and then when I was at school, suddenly, I was too black\u2014I always felt out of place.\u201d\nManuel has served as poetry editor for Gold Line Press and as managing editor of Ricochet Editions. He is currently pursuing a PhD at the University of Southern California, where he is a Middleton and Dornsife Fellow.\n", "attrs": {}}
