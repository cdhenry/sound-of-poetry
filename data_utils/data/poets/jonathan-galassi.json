Since 1986 he has served as an editor at the publishing house Farrar, Straus & Giroux.\nGalassi is also an eminent translator of Italian poetry. He\u00a0 has spent over 25 years studying Eugenio Montale\u2019s poetry and has published several collections of Montale\u2019s work, including Eugenio Montale: The Second Life of Art: Selected Essays (1982) and Collected Poems 1920\u20131954 (1998). Reviewing Collected Poems for the New York Times, Nicholas Jenkins found Galassi\u2019s translation \u201cfaithful to the weird lexical discords in Montale\u2019s writing, to its compactness, to its odd combination of verbal vigor and imaginative obscurity, to its often exquisitely discreet avoidance of rhyme\u201d; the London Review of Books pronounced Galassi\u2019s rendering \u201cunlikely to be superseded for a long time.\u201d He also translated and annotated Giacomo Leopardi's Canti (2010).\n\r\nRaised in southeastern Massachusetts, Galassi studied poetry at Harvard University with Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop. He is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and is an honorary chairman of the Academy of American Poets. He has headed the publishing firm Farrar, Straus & Giroux for many years. In 2008 he received the Maxwell E. Perkins Award, which recognizes an editor, publisher, or agent who \u201chas discovered, nurtured and championed writers of fiction in the U.S.\u201d\n\r\nBlogging for the Poetry Foundation, Galassi reflected, \u201cThe truth is that most poetry, even most of what is greatly prized and read today, even what has been wrested from nothingness by these heroes of mine, is destined to be forgotten. But that\u2019s not our concern. The future will decide what it can make use of.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
