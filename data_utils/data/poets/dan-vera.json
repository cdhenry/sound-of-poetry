He is the author of Speaking Wiri Wiri (2013), which poet Orlando Ricardo Menes chose for the inaugural Letras Latinas/Red Hen Poetry Prize, and The Space Between Our Danger and Delight (2008). In his compassionate, humorous poems, Vera explores the shifting nature of identity. In a review of Speaking Wiri Wiri for Lambda Literary, Charlie Bondhus observed, \u201cso much of Vera\u2019s work is about a simultaneous \u2018splitness\u2019 and \u2018togetherness\u2019\u2014between Cuba and the United States; between English and Spanish; between revering history and lamenting its fallout.\u201d Vera himself has said of his work, \u201cI love discovering these layers of meaning that serve as a trap-door for anyone trying to be rigid about identity: our own and others.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nVera cofounded VRZHU Press, is the publisher of Souvenir Spoon Press, and serves as managing editor of the journal White Crane. With poet Kim Roberts, Vera curates DC Writers' Homes. He has served on the boards of Split This Rock and Rainbow History Project. He lives in Washington, DC.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
