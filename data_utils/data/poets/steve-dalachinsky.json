He is the author of numerous poetry collections, including Where Night and Day Become One: The French Poems (2018); The Final Nite & Other Poems: Complete Notes from a Charles Gayle Notebook, 1987\u20132006, which won the 2007 PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Book Award; and A Superintendent\u2019s Eyes (2000). With his wife, Yuko Otomo, he cowrote the collection Frozen Heatwave (2017). Dalachinsky\u2019s honors include the 2013 Acker Award. In a review of A Superintendent\u2019s Eyes in A Gathering of the Tribes, Alan Kaufman wrote, \u201cThe poems, assembled over 20 years, are a sometimes joyous, sometimes shattering glimpse of life seen from behind the headlines.\u201d\u00a0 \nDalachinsky also collaborated with musicians such as Loren Connors, and he was a beloved figure in the New York music scene. He frequently attended free-jazz concerts\u2014sometimes several in one night\u2014and many of these performances inspired his poems. In an interview with Lisa Chau in HuffPost, Dalachinsky notes writers William Blake, Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Allen Ginsberg, Franz Kafka, and Amiri Baraka, as well as musicians John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, and Charles Mingus as inspirations for his work \u201cbecause they are challenging and have challenged the limits of their art\u2014craft of sound, of space, of hardship and personal limitations.\u201d\nDalachinsky died in 2019.\n", "attrs": {}}
