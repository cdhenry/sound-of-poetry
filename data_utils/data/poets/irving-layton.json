His family moved to Montreal when he was a year old; when his father died, Layton, just 13, briefly left school to sell household goods door to door before enrolling in high school, where his encounter with Tennyson\u2019s poem \u201cThe Revenge\u201d inspired him to try writing. He earned a degree in agriculture at Macdonald College, where he joined the Young People\u2019s Socialist League. His involvement with the League led to his being banned from entering the United States for 15 years. Layton enlisted in the Canadian Army in 1942 and was honorably discharged a year later. He served as an editor for First Statement Press, which published his debut, Here and Now (1945), as well as for Contact Press. Poet and singer Leonard Cohen was his student and became a close friend.  \u00a0 Layton\u2019s lush, elemental poems explore sexual and spiritual intimacy. He published numerous collections of poetry, including The Black Huntsmen (1951), A Red Carpet for the Sun (1959), The Pole-Vaulter (1974), The Selected Poems of Irving Layton (1977), Final Reckoning: Poems 1982-1986 (1987), and A Wild Peculiar Joy: Selected Poems 1945-82. His prose includes Engagements: The Prose of Irving Layton (1972), Taking Sides: The Collected Social and Political Writings (1977), and the memoir Waiting for the Messiah (1985). Critical studies of his work include Raging Like a Fire: A Celebration of Irving Layton (1993) and Francis Mansbridge\u2019s biography Irving Layton: God\u2019s Recording Angel (1995). His correspondence is published in the volumes Wild Gooseberries: The Selected Letters of Irving Layton (1989), An Unlikely Affair (1980), and Irving Layton and Robert Creeley: The Complete Correspondence, 1953-1978 (1989). \u00a0 His honors included two Nobel Prize nominations, Italy\u2019s Petrarch Prize for Poetry, grants from the Canada Council, the Governor General\u2019s Award, the Senior Arts Fellowship, and several honorary degrees. Layton taught at Sir George Williams University and York University. In the mid-1990s, he received a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which led to his death in 2006. The University of Saskatchewan Library holds a selection of his papers.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Canada"]}}
