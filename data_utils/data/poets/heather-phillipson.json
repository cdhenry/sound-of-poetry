She was classically trained on the piano and violin and utilizes musical compositions, images, and texts for her video work. The medium of video, Phillipson has said, \u201callowed me to be all the things I wanted to be.\u201d Phillipson also works with installation and sculptural environments; her practice extends across many media, including music, text, and performance. As a poet, Phillipson draws on techniques from film editing\u2014notably montage and cutting. In an interview with\u00a0Rhizome,\u00a0Phillipson described how her processes intersect and overlap: \u201cwhether it's video editing or writing or walking between things in space, it's about the rhythm between the bits. And the bits are always colliding with or repelling or rubbing all over each other, synaesthetically. Structurally, the sculptural installations might be like arriving in the middle of a poem, not knowing what's going on, but understanding it\u2014all these metaphors, line-breaks and non-sequiturs. I'm trying to establish an equivalence, I suppose\u2014a kind of syntax of sounds, images, colours\u2014using them like parts of speech.\u201d\nPhillipson is the author of three collections of poetry:\u00a0Faber New Poets 3\u00a0(2009),\u00a0NOT AN ESSAY\u00a0(2012), and\u00a0Instant-flex 718\u00a0(2013), which was shortlisted for a Fenton Aldeburgh First Collection Prize and a Michael Murphy Memorial Prize. The recipient of an Eric Gregory Award, she was named a Next Generation Poet in 2014. Phillipson\u2019s installations have been exhibited widely at Whitechapel Gallery, the Images Festival in Toronto, Frieze Projects, the Sao Paolo Biennale and the Istanbul Biennial, Performa 15, Dundee Contemporary Arts, and the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, among other places. She has held events such as\u00a0Assembly\u00a0at Tate Britain,\u00a0the flavor of cooling enormities\u00a0at the Serpentine Gallery, and\u00a0BOG-STANDARD REFRESHER\u00a0at the ICA in London.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
