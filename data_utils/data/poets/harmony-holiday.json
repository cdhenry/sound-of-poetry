Her father died when she was five, and she and her mother moved to Los Angeles. Holiday earned a BA in rhetoric at the University of California, Berkeley and an MFA at Columbia University. She is the author of Negro League Baseball (2011), winner of the Fence Books Motherwell Prize; Go Find your Father/A Famous Blues (Ricochet Editions, 2013), a \u201cdos-a-dos\u201d book featuring poetry, letters, and essays; and Hollywood Forever (Fence Books, 2017), which she is turning into an afroballet. She is currently working on a biography of Abbey Lincoln and an epic called M a a f A (Fence, 2020), an exploration of reparations and the body.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHoliday\u2019s work tests the limits of language and memory, pushing at the elasticity of both poems and prose. A reviewer for Publishers Weekly noted of Negro League Baseball, \u201cChaotic and mesmerizing, with sex, violence, music, history and semantics moving at breakneck speed, Holiday's debut is a rare event: in prose poems and in isolated lines, her long unruly sentences take in a mother's funeral, a tumultuous love affair, Mississippi family roots, Northern branches, and the partly improvised, often confrontational styles of advanced African-American music from be-bop and post-bop to hip-hop and whatever lies beyond.\u201d She is currently working on a book of poems and lyric essays on Reparations and the body, as well as a\u00a0biography\u00a0of jazz singer Abbey Lincoln.\n\r\nHoliday has taught dance at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre and is the founder of Mythscience, an arts collective devoted to cross-disciplinary work that helps artists re-engage with their bodies and the physical world in this so-called digital age, and the Afrosonics archive of jazz and everyday diaspora poetics. In 2013 she was awarded a Ruth Lilly Fellowship from the Poetry Foundation. She lives in Los Angeles.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
