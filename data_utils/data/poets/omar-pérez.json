He earned a degree in English at the University of Havana and studied Italian at the Universit\u00e1 per Straniere di Siena. He has worked as a journalist for El Caim\u00e1n Barbudo, and as an editor for the magazine La naranja dulce. A former member of the Cuban intellectual group Paideia, he edited the poetry magazine Mantis from 1994 to 1996. He is the son of\u00a0revolutionary Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nOrdained as a Zen Buddhist monk, P\u00e9rez composes poems that engage languages, Zen, and political and cultural transcendence. His poetry collections include Lingua Franca (2010), O\u00edste hablar del gato de pelea? (1999, translated as Did You Hear about the Fighting Cat? by Kristin Dykstra, 2010), and Algo de lo Sagrado (1996, translated as Something of the Sacred by Kristin Dykstra and Robert Tejada, 2007).

He has also published a poet's notebook,\u00a0Cubanology\u00a0(2018, translated by Kristin Dykstra).\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nIntensely interested in the ways in which poetry overlays experience, Perez noted in an interview with Jacket magazine that \u201cthe verse, the poem, even the rhyme, the melody of poetry are the tip of the iceberg, they are just one familiar aspect of a huge reality which we call consciousness [\u2026] Poetry is a natural function, like god, or DNA, or rain. The fact that we can give notice of it does not mean that we make it.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nHe received Cuba\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n Prize for Poetry for Cr\u00edtica de la Raz\u00f3n Puta (2009) as well as its National Critics\u2019 Prize for his essay collection La perseverancia de un hombre oscuro (2000).
