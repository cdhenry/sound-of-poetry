Michener Center for Writers at the University of Texas at Austin. \u00a0 Fountain\u2019s poems often use narrative to explore the tug of the unseen on the visible fabric of our days. In a 2010 interview with Brian Brodeur for his blog How A Poem Happens, Fountain stated, \u201cTo me, whether a poem is factual or autobiographical is unimportant because that condition usually has nothing to do with whether the poem is successful or not or whether the poem touches on some truth (which is of far greater importance than fact) or not. [\u2026] I think the tendency to assume an autobiography while reading a poem has to do with the intimate nature of poetry, especially narrative poetry. The yielding voice.\u201d Fountain\u2019s debut collection of poems, Burn Lake (2010), was chosen by Natasha Trethewey for the National Poetry Series. \u00a0 Her honors include the Marlboro Poetry Prize, Austin Library Foundation\u2019s Award for Literary Excellence, a residency with the Frank Waters Foundation, and Swink magazine\u2019s Award for Emerging Writers.  \u00a0 She has taught at St. Edward\u2019s University, and lives in Austin.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
