He was a master stylist, employing an extraordinary vocabulary and a rigorous precision in crafting his poems. But he was also a philosopher of aesthetics, vigorously exploring the notion of poetry as the supreme fusion of the creative imagination and objective reality. Because of the extreme technical and thematic complexity of his work, Stevens was sometimes considered a difficult poet. But he was also acknowledged as an eminent abstractionist and a provocative thinker, and that reputation has continued since his death. In 1975, for instance, noted literary critic Harold Bloom, whose writings on Stevens include the imposing\u00a0Wallace Stevens: The Poems of Our Climate,\u00a0called him \u201cthe best and most representative American poet of our time.\u201d\n\r\nStevens was born in 1879 in Reading, Pennsylvania. His family belonged to the Dutch Reformed Church and when Stevens became eligible he enrolled in parochial schools. Stevens\u2019s father contributed substantially to the son\u2019s early education by providing their home with an extensive library and by encouraging reading. At age 12 Stevens entered public school for boys and began studying classics in Greek and Latin. In high school he became a prominent student, scoring high marks and distinguishing himself as a skillful orator. He also showed early promise as a writer by reporting for the school\u2019s newspaper, and after completing his studies in Reading he decided to continue his literary pursuits at Harvard University.\n\r\nEncouraged by his father, Stevens devoted himself to the literary aspects of Harvard life. By his sophomore year he wrote regularly for the Harvard\u00a0Advocate,\u00a0and by the end of his third year, as biographer Samuel French Morse noted in\u00a0Wallace Stevens: Poetry as Life,\u00a0he had received all of the school\u2019s honors for writing. In 1899 Stevens joined the editorial board of the\u00a0Advocate\u2019s rival publication, the\u00a0Harvard Monthly,\u00a0and the following year he assumed the board\u2019s presidency and became editor. By that time Stevens had already published poems in both the\u00a0Advocate\u00a0and the\u00a0Monthly,\u00a0and as editor he also produced stories and literary sketches. Because there was a frequent shortage of material during his tenure as editor, Stevens often published several of his own works in each issue of the Monthly.\u00a0He was recognized on campus as a prolific and multitalented writer. Unfortunately, his campus literary endeavors ended in 1900 when a shortage of family funds necessitated his withdrawal from the university.\n\r\nLeaving Harvard was hardly a setback, though, for Stevens was not working towards a college degree and was not particularly invigorated by the school\u2019s literary environment. Once out of Harvard, Stevens decided to work as a journalist, and shortly thereafter he began reporting for the\u00a0New York Evening Post.\u00a0He published regularly in the newspaper, but found the work dull and inconsequential. The job proved most worthwhile as a means for Stevens to acquaint himself with New York City. Each day he explored various areas and then recorded his observations in a journal. In the evenings he either attended theatrical and musical productions or remained in his room writing poems or drafting a play.\n\r\nStevens soon tired of this life, however, and questioned his father on the possibility of abandoning the newspaper position to entirely devote himself to literature. But his father, while a lover of literature, was also prudent, and he counseled his son to cease writing and study the law. Stevens heeded the advice, and he attended the New York School of Law from 1901 to 1904. He then worked briefly in a law partnership with former Harvard classmate Lyman Ward. After parting from Ward, Stevens worked for various law firms in New York City. In 1908 he accepted a post with the American Bonding Company, an insurance firm, and he stayed with the company when it was purchased by the Fidelity and Deposit Company.\n\r\nStevens\u2019s early years with the insurance firm brought great personal change. Financially secure, he proposed marriage to Elsie Viola Kachel, who accepted and became his wife in September 1909. Two years later Stevens\u2019s father died, and in 1912 his mother also died. During this period Stevens apparently wrote no poetry, but he involved himself in New York City\u2019s artistic community through his association with several writers, including poets\u00a0Marianne Moore\u00a0 and\u00a0William Carlos Williams. Stevens was keenly interested in the art exhibitions at the city\u2019s many museums and galleries. He developed a fondness for modern painting, eventually becoming a connoisseur and collector of Asian art, including painting, pottery, and jewelry. He particularly admired Asian works for their vivid colors and their precision and clarity, qualities that he later imparted to his own art.\n\r\nBy 1913 Stevens was enjoying great success in the field of insurance law. Unlike many aspiring artists he was hardly stifled by steady employment. He soon resumed writing poetry, though in a letter to his wife he confided that writing was \u201cabsurd\u201d as well as fulfilling. In 1914 he nonetheless published two poems in the modest periodical\u00a0Trend,\u00a0and four more verses for\u00a0Harriet Monroe\u2019s publication,\u00a0Poetry.\u00a0None of these poems were included in Stevens\u2019s later volumes, but they are often considered his first mature writings.\n\r\nAfter he began publishing his poems Stevens changed jobs again, becoming resident vice president, in New York City, of the Equitable Surety Company (which became the New England Equitable Company). He left that position in 1916 to work for the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, where he remained employed for the rest of his life, becoming vice president in 1934.\n\r\nThis period of job changes was also one of impressive literary achievements for Stevens. In 1915 he produced his first important poems, \u201cPeter Quince at the Clavier\u201d and \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d and in 1916 he published his prizewinning play,\u00a0Three Travelers Watch a Sunrise.\u00a0Another play,\u00a0Carlos among the Candles,\u00a0followed in 1917, and the comic poem \u201cLe Monocle de Mon Oncle\u201d appeared in 1918. During the next few years Stevens began organizing his poems for publication in a single volume. For inclusion in that prospective volume he also produced several longer poems, including the masterful \u201cThe Comedian as the Letter C.\u201d This poem, together with the early \u201cSunday Morning\u201d and \u201cLe Monocle de Mon Oncle,\u201d proved key to Stevens\u2019s volume\u00a0Harmonium\u00a0when it was published in 1923.\n\nHarmonium\u00a0bears ample evidence of Stevens\u2019s wide-ranging talents: an extraordinary vocabulary, a flair for memorable phrasing, an accomplished sense of imagery, and the ability to both lampoon and philosophize. \u201cPeter Quince at the Clavier,\u201d among the earliest poems in\u00a0Harmonium, contains aspects of all these skills. In this poem, a beautiful woman\u2019s humiliating encounter with lustful elders becomes a meditation on the nature of beauty (and the beauty of nature). Stevens vividly captures the woman\u2019s plight by dramatically contrasting the tranquility of her bath with a jarring interruption by several old folk. Consistent with the narrator\u2019s contention that \u201cmusic is feeling,\u201d the woman\u2019s plight is emphasized by descriptions of sounds from nature and musical instruments. The poem culminates in a reflection on the permanence of the woman\u2019s physical beauty, which, it is declared, exists forever in memory and through death in the union of body and nature: \u201cThe body dies; the body\u2019s beauty lives. / So evenings die, in their green going, / A wave, interminably flowing.\u201d\n\r\n\u201cPeter Quince at the Clavier,\u201d with its notion of immortality as a natural cycle, serves as a prelude to the more ambitious \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d in which cyclical nature is proposed as the sole alternative to Christianity in the theologically bankrupt 20th century. Here Stevens echoes the theme of \u201cPeter Quince at the Clavier\u201d by writing that \u201cdeath is the mother of beauty,\u201d thus confirming that physical beauty is immortal through death and the consequent consummation with nature. \u201cSunday Morning\u201d ends by stripping the New Testament\u2019s Jesus Christ of transcendence and consigning him, too, to immortality void of an afterlife but part of \u201cthe heavenly fellowship / of men that perish.\u201d In this manner \u201cSunday Morning\u201d shatters the tenets, or illusion, of Christianity essentially, the spiritual afterlife\u2014and substantiates nature\u2014the joining of corpse to earth as the only channel to immortality. In her volume\u00a0Wallace Stevens: An Introduction to the Poetry,\u00a0Susan B. Weston described the replacement of Christianity with nature as the essence of the poem, and she called \u201cSunday Morning\u201d the \u201crevelation of a secular religion.\u201d\n\r\nLess profound, perhaps, but no less impressive are\u00a0Harmonium\u2019s comedic highlights, \u201cLe Monocle de Mon Oncle\u201d and \u201cThe Comedian as the Letter C.\u201d In \u201cLe Monocle de Mon Oncle\u201d the narrator, a middle-aged poet, delivers an extended, rather flamboyantly embellished, monologue to love in all its embodiments and evocations. He reflects on his own loves and ambitions in such carefree detail that the work seems an amusing alternative to\u00a0T.S. Eliot\u2019s pessimistic poem \u201cThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.\u201d Like \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d \u201cLe Monocle de Mon Oncle\u201d celebrates change, and it suggests that even in fluctuation there is definition\u2014\u201cthat fluttering things have so distinct a shade.\u201d\n\r\nIn the mock epic \u201cComedian as the Letter C\u201d Stevens presents a similarly introspective protagonist, Crispin, who is, or has been, a poet, handyman, musician, and rogue. The poem recounts Crispin\u2019s adventures from France to the jungle to a lush, Eden-like land where he establishes his own colony and devotes himself to contemplating his purpose in life. During the course of his adventures Crispin evolves from romantic to realist and from poet to parent, the latter two roles being, according to the poem, mutually antagonistic. The poem ends with Crispin dourly viewing his six daughters as poems and questioning the validity of creating anything that must, eventually, become separate from him.\n\r\n\u201cThe Comedian as the Letter C\u201d is a fairly complex work, evincing Stevens\u2019s impressive, and occasionally intimidating, vocabulary and his penchant for obscure humor. Stevens later declared that his own motivations in writing the poem derived from his enthusiasm for \u201cwords and sounds.\u201d He stated: \u201cI suppose that I ought to confess that by the letter C I meant the sound of the letter C; what was in my mind was to play on that sound throughout the poem. While the sound of that letter has more or less variety ... all its shades maybe said to have a comic aspect. Consequently, the letter C is a comedian.\u201d\n\r\nAlthough these poems are perhaps the most substantial in\u00a0Harmonium,\u00a0they are hardly the volume\u2019s only noteworthy ones. Also among the more than 50 poems that comprise Stevens\u2019s first book are \u201cThirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,\u201d an imagistic poem highly reminiscent of haiku, and \u201cThe Emperor of Ice-Cream,\u201d an eloquent exhortation that death is an inevitable aspect of living. These and the other entries in\u00a0Harmonium\u00a0reveal Stevens as a poet of delicate, but determined, sensibility, one whose perspective is precise without being precious, and whose wit is subtle but not subdued. Harriet Monroe, founder and first editor of\u00a0Poetry,\u00a0reviewed\u00a0Harmonium\u00a0for her own periodical: \u201cThe delight which one breathes like a perfume from the poetry of Wallace Stevens is the natural effluence of his own clear and untroubled and humorously philosophical delight in the beauty of things as they are.\u201d\n\r\nFew critics of the time, however, shared Monroe\u2019s enthusiasm, or even her familiarity with Harmonium. The book was ignored in most critical quarters, and dismissed as a product of mere dilettantism by some of the few reviewers that acknowledged Stevens\u2019s art. Although apparently undaunted by the poor reception accorded Harmonium, Stevens produced only a few poems during the next several years. Part of this unproductiveness was attributed by Stevens to the birth of his daughter, Holly, in 1924. Like his autobiographical character Crispin, Stevens found that parenting thwarted writing. In a letter to Harriet Monroe he noted that the responsibilities of parenthood were a \u201cterrible blow to poor literature.\u201d\n\r\nIn 1933, nine years after his daughter\u2019s birth, Stevens finally resumed writing steadily. The following year he published his second poetry collection,\u00a0Ideas of Order,\u00a0and in 1935 he produced an expanded edition of that same work. The poems of\u00a0Ideas of Order\u00a0are, generally, sparer and gloomier than those of\u00a0Harmonium.\u00a0Prominent among these bleak works is \u201cLike Decorations in a Nigger Cemetery,\u201d comprised of 50 verses on subjects such as aging and dying. Perhaps in reference to these 50 short verses, the racist title refers to the litter that, in Stevens\u2019s opinion, accumulated in blacks\u2019 cemeteries. He ends this poem by noting the futility of attempts to thwart nature and by commending those individuals who adapt to change: \u201cUnion of the weakest develops strength / Not wisdom. Can all men, together, avenge / One of the leaves that have fallen in autumn? / But the wise avenges by building his city in snow.\u201d\n\r\nStevens more clearly explicated his notion of creative imagination in \u201cThe Idea of Order in Key West,\u201d among the few invigorating poems in\u00a0Ideas of Order\u00a0and one of the most important works in his entire canon. In this poem Stevens wrote of strolling along the beach with a friend and discovering a girl singing to the ocean. Stevens declares that the girl has created order out of chaos by fashioning a sensible song from her observations of the swirling sea. The concluding stanza extolls the virtues of the singer\u2019s endeavor (\u201cThe maker\u2019s rage to order words of the sea\u201d) and declares that the resulting song is an actual aspect of the singer. In his book\u00a0Wallace Stevens: The Making of the Poem,\u00a0Frank Doggett called the concluding stanza Stevens\u2019s \u201chymn to the ardor of the poet to give order to the world by his command of language.\u201d\n\r\nFollowing the publication of\u00a0Ideas of Order\u00a0Stevens began receiving increasing recognition as an important and unique poet. Not all of that recognition, however, was entirely positive. Some critics charged that the obscurity, abstraction, and self-contained, art-for-art\u2019s-sake tenor of his work were inappropriate and ineffective during a time of international strife that included widespread economic depression and increasing fascism in Europe. Stevens, comfortably ensconced in his half-acre home in Hartford, responded that the world was improving, not degenerating further. He held himself relatively detached from politics and world affairs, although he briefly championed leading Italian fascist Benito Mussolini, and contended that his art actually constituted the most substantial reality. \u201cLife is not people and scene,\u201d he argued, \u201cbut thought and feeling. The world is myself. Life is myself.\u201d\n\r\nStevens contended that the poet\u2019s purpose was to interpret the external world of thought and feeling through the imagination. Like his alter ego Crispin, Stevens became preoccupied with articulating his perception of the poet\u2019s purpose, and he sought to explore that theme in his 1936 book,\u00a0Owl\u2019s Clover.\u00a0But that book comprised of five explications of various individuals\u2019 relations to art proved verbose and thus uncharacteristically excessive. Immensely displeased, Stevens immediately dismantled the volume and reshaped portions of the work for inclusion in a forthcoming collection.\n\r\nThat volume,\u00a0The Man with the Blue Guitar,\u00a0succeeded where\u00a0Owl\u2019s Clover\u00a0failed, presenting a varied, eloquently articulated contention of the same theme the poet, and therefore the imagination, as the explicator of thought and feeling that had undone him earlier. In the title poem Stevens defends the poet\u2019s responsibility to shape and define perceived reality: \u201cThey said, \u2018You have a blue guitar, / You do not play things as they are.\u2019 / The man replied, \u2018Things as they are / Are changed upon the blue guitar.\u2019\u201d For Stevens, the blue guitar was the power of imagination, and the power of imagination, in turn, was \u201cthe power of the mind over the possibility of things\u201d and \u201cthe power that enables us to perceive the normal in the abnormal.\u201d\n\nThe Man with the Blue Guitar,\u00a0particularly the 33-part title poem, constituted a breakthrough for Stevens by indicating a new direction: an inexhaustive articulation of the imagination as the supreme perception and of poetry as the supreme fiction. Harold Bloom, in acknowledging Stevens\u2019s debacle\u00a0Owl\u2019s Clover,\u00a0described\u00a0The Man with the Blue Guitar\u00a0as the poet\u2019s \u201ctriumph over ... literary anxieties\u201d and added that with its completion Stevens renewed his poetic aspirations and vision. \u201cThe poet who had written\u00a0The Man with the Blue Guitar\u00a0had weathered his long crisis,\u201d Bloom wrote, \u201cand at fifty-eight was ready to begin again.\u201d\n\r\nIn subsequent volumes Stevens single-mindedly concentrated on his idea of poetry as the perfect synthesis of reality and the imagination. Consequently, much of his poetry is about poetry. In his next collection,\u00a0Parts of a World,\u00a0his writing frequently adopts a solipsistic perspective in exemplifying and explicating his definition of poetry. Such poems as \u201cPrelude to Objects,\u201d \u201cAdd This to Rhetoric,\u201d and \u201cOf Modern Poetry\u201d all address, to some extent, the self-referential nature of poetry. In \u201cOf Modern Poetry\u201d Stevens defined the genre as \u201cthe finding of a satisfaction, and may / Be of a man skating, a woman dancing, a woman / Combing. The poem of the act of the mind.\u201d In\u00a0Wallace Stevens: An Introduction to the Poetry,\u00a0Susan B. Weston wrote that in \u201cOf Modern Poetry,\u201d as with many poems in\u00a0Parts of a World, \u201cStevens cannot say what the mind wants to hear; he must be content to write about a poetry that would express what the mind wants to hear, and to render the satisfaction that might ensue.\u201d\nStevens followed\u00a0Parts of a World\u00a0with\u00a0Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction,\u00a0which is usually considered his greatest poem on the nature of poetry. This long poem, more an exploration of a definition than it is an actual definition, exemplifies the tenets of supreme fiction even as it articulates them. The poem is comprised of a prologue, three substantial sections, and a coda. The first main section, entitled \u201cIt Must Be Abstract,\u201d recalls\u00a0Harmonium\u2019s themes by hailing art as the new deity in a theologically deficient age. Abstraction is necessary, Stevens declares, because it fosters the sense of mystery necessary to provoke interest and worship from humanity. The second long portion, \u201cIt Must Change,\u201d recalls \u201cSunday Morning\u201d in citing change as that which ever renews and sustains life: \u201cWinter and spring, cold copulars, embrace / And for the particulars of rapture come.\u201d And in \u201cIt Must Give Pleasure,\u201d Stevens expresses his conviction that poetry must always be \u201ca thing final in itself and, therefore, good: / One of the vast repetitions final in themselves and, therefore, good, the going round / And round and round, the merely going round, / Until merely going round is a final good, / The way wine comes at a table in a wood.\u201d Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction\u00a0concludes with verses describing the poet\u2019s pursuit of supreme fiction as \u201ca war that never ends.\u201d Stevens, directing these verses to an imaginary warrior, wrote: \u201cSoldier, there is a war between the mind / And sky, between thought and day and night. It is / For that the poet is always in the sun, / Patches the moon together in his room / to his Virgilian cadences, up down, / Up down. It is a war that never ends.\u201d This is perhaps Stevens\u2019s most impressive description of his own sense of self, and in it he provides his most succinct appraisal of the poet\u2019s duty.\n\r\nAlthough\u00a0Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction\u00a0elucidates Stevens\u2019s notions of poetry and poet, it was not intended by him to serve as a definitive testament. Rather, he considered the poem as a collection of ideas about the idea of supreme fiction. Writing to Henry Church, to whom the poem is dedicated, Stevens warned that it was not a systematized philosophy but mere notes\u2014 \u201cthe nucleus of the matter is contained in the title.\u201d He also reaffirmed his contention that poetry was the supreme fiction, explaining that poetry was supreme because \u201cthe essence of poetry is change and the essence of change is that it gives pleasure.\u201d\n\nNotes Toward a Supreme Fiction\u00a0was published as a small volume in 1942 and was subsequently included in the 1947 collection,\u00a0Transport to Summer.\u00a0Also featured in the collection is\u00a0Esthetique du Mal,\u00a0another long poem first published separately. In this poem Stevens explored the poetic imagination\u2019s response to specific provocations: pain and evil. Seconding philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, Stevens asserted that evil was a necessary aspect of life, and he further declared that it was both inspirational and profitable to the imagination. This notion is most clearly articulated in the poem\u2019s eighth section, which begins: \u201cThe death of Satan was a tragedy / For the imagination. A capital / Negation destroyed him in his tenement / And, with him, many blue phenomena.\u201d In a later stanza, one in which Bloom found the poem\u2019s \u201ccentral polemic,\u201d Stevens emphasizes the positive aspect of evil: \u201cThe tragedy, however, may have begun, / Again, in the imagination\u2019s new beginning, / In the yes of the realist spoken because he must / Say yes, spoken because under every no / Lay a passion for yes that had never been broken.\u201d In\u00a0Wallace Stevens: The Poems of Our Climate,\u00a0Bloom called\u00a0Esthetique du Mal\u00a0Stevens\u2019s \u201cmajor humanistic polemic\u201d of the mid-1940s.\n\r\nIn 1950 Stevens published his last new poetry collection,\u00a0The Auroras of Autumn.\u00a0The poems in this volume show Stevens further refining and ordering his ideas about the imagination and poetry. Among the most prominent works in this volume is \u201cAn Ordinary Evening in New Haven,\u201d which constitutes still another set of notes toward a supreme fiction. Here Stevens finds the sublime in the seemingly mundane by recording his contemplations of a given evening. The style here is spare and abstract, resulting in a poem that revels in ambiguity and the elusiveness of definitions: \u201cIt is not the premise that reality / Is solid. It may be a shade that traverses / A dust, a force that traverses a shade.\u201d In this poem Stevens once again explicates as the supreme synthesis of perception and the imagination and produces a poem about poetry: \u201cThis endlessly elaborating poem / Displays the theory of poetry, / As the life of poetry.\u201d Other poems in\u00a0The Auroras of Autumn\u00a0are equally self-reflexive, but they are ultimately less ambitious and less provocative, concerned more with rendering the mundane through abstraction and thus prompting a sense of mystery and, simultaneously, order. As fellow poet\u00a0Louise Bogan\u00a0noted in a\u00a0New Yorker\u00a0review of the collection, only Stevens \u201ccan describe the simplicities of the natural world with more direct skill,\u201d though she added that his \u201cis a natural world strangely empty of human beings.\u201d\n\r\nStevens followed\u00a0The Auroras of Autumn\u00a0with a prose volume about his poetics,\u00a0The Necessary Angel. In the essay \u201cThe Noble Rider and the Sound of Words\u201d he addressed the imagination\u2019s response to adversity, and in \u201cThe Figure of the Youth as Virile Poet\u201d he once again championed the imagination as the medium toward a reality transcending mere action and rationalization. Consistent in the volume is Stevens\u2019s willingness to render his ideas in a precise, accessible manner. Thus\u00a0The Necessary Angel\u00a0considerably illuminates his poetry.\n\r\nBy the early 1950s Stevens was regarded as one of America\u2019s greatest contemporary poets, an artist whose precise abstractions exerted substantial influence on other writers. Despite this widespread recognition, Stevens kept his position at the Hartford company, perhaps fearing that he would become isolated if he left his lucrative post. In his later years with the firm, Stevens amassed many writing awards, including the Bollingen Prize for Poetry, the 1951 National Book Award for\u00a0The Auroras of Autumn,\u00a0and several honorary doctorates. His greatest accolades, however, came with the 1955 publication of\u00a0The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens,\u00a0which earned him the Pulitzer Prize for poetry and another National Book Award. In this volume Stevens gathered nearly all of his previously published verse, save\u00a0Owl\u2019s Clover,\u00a0and added another 25 poems under the title \u201cThe Rock.\u201d Included in this section are some of Stevens\u2019s finest and most characteristically abstract poems. Appropriately, the final poem in \u201cThe Rock\u201d is entitled \u201cNot Ideas about the Thing but the Thing Itself,\u201d in which reality and the imagination are depicted as fusing at the instant of perception: \u201cThat scrawny cry\u2014it was / A chorister whose\u00a0c\u00a0preceded the choir. / It was part of the colossal sun, / Surrounded by its choral rings, / Still far away. It was like / A new knowledge of reality.\u201d\n\r\nAfter publishing his collected verse Stevens suffered increasingly from cancer and was repeatedly hospitalized. He died in August 1955. In the years since his death Stevens\u2019s reputation has remained formidable. The obscurity and abstraction of his poetry has proven particularly appealing among students and academicians and has consequently generated extensive criticism. Among the most respected interpreters of Stevens\u2019s work are Helen Vendler, who has demonstrated particular expertise on the longer poems, and Harold Bloom, whose\u00a0Wallace Stevens: The Poems of Our Climate\u00a0is probably the most provocative and substantial, if also dense and verbose, of the many volumes attending to Stevens\u2019s entire canon. For Bloom, Stevens is \u201ca vital part of the American mythology.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
