Critics have called Val\u00e9ry the last French symbolist, the first post-symbolist, a masterful classical prosodist, and an advocate of logical positivism.\u00a0Clearly, Val\u00e9ry was heir to the symbolist tradition of another French poet, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, whom he knew and venerated, who encouraged his early work, and whose other young disciples\u2014Pierre Louis in particular\u2014got Val\u00e9ry\u2019s work published. On the other hand, he is understood as having broken away from symbolism, as having rejected the cult of poetry for its own sake in favor of a cult of the mind. These views need not be contradictory.\n\r\nIn the highly formal, mannered musicality of Val\u00e9ry\u2019s verse, the influence of Mallarm\u00e9 is unmistakable. Val\u00e9ry\u2019s\u00a0Notebooks (Cahiers)\u00a0record his conviction that the subject of a poem was far less important than its \u201cprogram\u201d: \u201cA sort of program would consist of a gathering of words (among which conjunctives are just as important as substantives) and of types of syntactical moments, and above all a table of verbal tonalities, etc.\u201d Mallarm\u00e9 had said something very similar in \u201cMusic and Letters\u201d (\u201cLa Musique et les lettres\u201d): \u201cI assert, at my own aesthetic risk ... that Music and Letters are the alternate face here widened towards the obscure; scintillating there, with certainty of a phenomenon, the only one, I have named it Idea.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nFor Mallarm\u00e9, as for his younger disciple, Idea was not a theme that could be formulated in a sentence or two; it was not a thought but rather the ongoing process of thought within the mind. Yet although Mallarm\u00e9 believed that the end product of thought had to be a poem, Val\u00e9ry disagreed. In his view, thought\u2014the mirror-like refraction of the human mind\u2014was always an end in itself; poetry was simply a more or less desirable by-product, to be pursued as long as it stimulated the mental processes. As he put it in his\u00a0Notebooks, \u201cIn sum, Mallarm\u00e9 and I, this in common\u2014poem is problem. And this, very important.\u201d But Val\u00e9ry also declared: \u201cFor him: the work. For me, the self ... \u00a0Poetry has never been an objective for me, but an instrument, an exercise.\u201d Responding to 17th-century poet and critic Nicolas Boileau\u2019s time-honored dictum that \u201cmy verse, good or bad, always\u00a0says\u00a0something,\u201d Val\u00e9ry asserted in the\u00a0Notebooks, \u201cThere is the principle and the germ of an infinity of horrors.\u201d\n\r\nA corollary of these convictions was the idea that no pure literature was possible as long as the writer thought of himself as addressing a public. As long as the audience for a text was kept in mind, Val\u00e9ry wrote in his\u00a0Notebooks, \u201cthere are always reserves in one\u2019s thoughts, a hidden intention in which is to be found a whole stock of charlatanism. Therefore every literary product is an\u00a0impure\u00a0product.\u201d The relative purity of Mallarm\u00e9, \u201cthe Master,\u201d as Val\u00e9ry called him, was thus entirely congruent with and dependent on both Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s total disregard for\u2014indeed, ignorance of\u2014the public taste and his consequent obscurity (no one outside of a very small Parisian circle had read his poems or knew of his existence until well into the twentieth century). For Val\u00e9ry, as he reported in his\u00a0Notebooks, \u201cif a poet is allowed to use crude means, if a mosaic of images is a poem, then damn poetry.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nA brief comparison of Val\u00e9ry\u2019s famous poem\u00a0\u201cThe Young Fate\u201d\u00a0(\u201cLa Jeune Parque\u201d) to Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s \u201cHerodiade\u201d concretely illustrates the nature of the older writer\u2019s influence on the young one. Both poems depict a young woman engaged in narcissistic introspection, both embody a severely formal, musical prosody, and both deliberately reject any identifiable \u201ccontent,\u201d or theme. Val\u00e9ry\u2019s poem is, in fact, more obscure and less musical than Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s simply because it is more purely metaphysical (one is compelled to use the term despite Val\u00e9ry\u2019s abhorrence of it as connoting a certain intellectual frivolity).\u00a0\n\r\nVal\u00e9ry\u2019s passion for \u201cscientific speculation,\u201d which is how he preferred to label his metaphysical writing and that of others, was the reason for his lifelong fascination with American writer Edgar Allan Poe. In\u00a0The Tell-Tale Heart: The Life and Works of Edgar Allan Poe, Julian Symons has described Poe as divided between two obsessive tendencies in his writings, a visionary one and a logical one. Although Mallarm\u00e9 and French poet Charles Baudelaire had celebrated the visionary qualities in Poe, Val\u00e9ry most fully admired his powers of reason, as revealed through Poe\u2019s pseudo-scientific meditation on the nature of human knowledge, \u201cEureka,\u201d and through his brilliant practical logician, Auguste Dupin, the detective of \u201cThe Murders in the Rue Morgue\u201d and \u201cThe Purloined Letter.\u201d \u201cVal\u00e9ry\u2019s unyielding positivism (rationalism) is thus another characteristic setting him apart from other French writers. In an early letter to Andr\u00e9 Gide, Val\u00e9ry wrote, \u201cPoe, and I shouldn\u2019t talk about it for I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t, is the only writer\u2014with no sins. Never was he mistaken\u2014not led instinctively\u2014but lucidly and successfully, he made a synthesis of all the vertigoes.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nJames Lawler, probably the most prominent and reliable American critic of Val\u00e9ry\u2019s work, has, in\u00a0The Poet as Analyst: Essays on Paul Val\u00e9ry, convincingly explained Val\u00e9ry\u2019s interest in \u201cEureka\u201d: \u201cQuite apart from Poe\u2019s poetics, here was a work that fascinated [Val\u00e9ry] by its scientific theories, by its poetic subject ... [\u2018the expression of a generalized will to relativity\u2019] and, significantly, by the form adopted, which coincides, one may say, with Val\u00e9ry\u2019s own literary practice in\u00a0La Jeune Parque [The Young Fate]\u00a0and\u00a0Charmes [Charms]\u00a0... [\u2018example and enactment of the reciprocity of appropriation\u2019].\u201d In \u201cEureka\u201d Poe described knowledge and being as part of an interconnected system: \u201cIn the original unity of the first thing lies the secondary cause of all things, with the germ of their inevitable annihilation.\u201d From Poe\u2019s theory Val\u00e9ry extracted his own, odd fusion of the visionary and the logical, the mystical and the rational, which he however refused to admit as anything but pure science and logic. \u201cThe cosmogonic form,\u201d he wrote in his essay on \u201cEureka,\u201d \u201ccomprises sacred books, admirable poems, excessively bizarre stories, full of beauty and nonsense, physico-mathematical researches of a profundity sometimes worthy of an object less insignificant than the universe. But it is the glory of man to be able to spend himself on the void; and it is not only his glory. Lunatic researches are akin to unforeseen discoveries. The role of the nonexistent exists; the function of the imaginary is real; and pure logic teaches us that\u00a0the false implies the true. It seems then that the history of the mind can be resumed in these terms: it is absurd by what it seeks, great by what it finds ... \u00a0As for the idea of a beginning,\u2014I mean of an absolute beginning\u2014it is necessarily a myth. Every beginning is a coincidence; we would have to conceive it as I don\u2019t know what sort of contact between all and nothing. Trying to think of it one finds that all beginning is a consequence\u2014every beginning completes something.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nIn the face of such statements, Val\u00e9ry\u2019s scorn for the mystical may seem incongruous, but this attitude is nevertheless a prominent feature of his thought, evident most of all in his contempt for the 17th-century mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal. One might say that he projected the visionary aspect, usually recognized in Poe, onto Pascal, while making Rene Descartes, Pascal\u2019s contemporary, a figure of what he admired in Poe, a logician and scientist. His recurrent, even obsessive, denigration of Pascal may reflect Val\u00e9ry\u2019s fear that his own distinction between science and metaphysics, rationalism and mysticism, might not hold up, that in fact\u2014as is so evident in Val\u00e9ry\u2019s own \u201cscientific\u201d musings\u2014there might be some mutual contamination of the categories. This suspicion is also borne out by Val\u00e9ry\u2019s response to the Jewish philosopher Henri Bergson during the German occupation of France during World War II; Val\u00e9ry publicly admired Bergson but added that he could not accept Bergson\u2019s belief that scientific knowledge was antithetical to the human spirit.\u00a0\n\r\nVal\u00e9ry conceived himself as an anti-philosopher, and he despised the new discipline of psychology as it was emerging in the work of neurologist and psychoanalytical pioneer Sigmund Freud, because both philosophy and psychology sought to do precisely what he wished to avoid: to\u00a0interpret, to\u00a0reduce, the form of thought, event, and act to a content. He criticized French novelist Marcel Proust for this very tendency, though in doing so he misread Proust. Val\u00e9ry, it must be admitted, was blinded to a great deal in literature by his obsessive commitment to purity of thought. In\u00a0Margins of Philosophy\u00a0Jacques Derrida has discussed Val\u00e9ry\u2019s aversion to Freud: \u201cWe will not ask what the meaning of this resistance is before pointing out that what Val\u00e9ry intends to resist is meaning itself. What he reproaches psychoanalysis for is not that it interprets in such or such a fashion, but quite simply that it interprets at all, that it is an interpretation, that it is interested above all in signification, in meaning, and in some principal unity\u2014here, a sexual unity\u2014of meaning.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nDerrida sees Val\u00e9ry\u2019s formalism as both reflection and instrument of his \u201crepression\u201d of meaning, and indeed, Val\u00e9ry\u2019s rigid adherence to classical prosody is another trait that sets him very much apart from other 20th-century French poets. He is undoubtedly the last French poet to write such intensely regular verse; to this extent at least his influence on later French poetry has been nil. Yet his reasons for remaining faithful to form\u2014more so, in many instances, than Baudelaire and Mallarm\u00e9 who were formalists but innovative ones\u2014were much more interesting than a mindless traditionalism. \u201cTo write regular verses,\u201d he declared in the\u00a0Notebooks, \u201cis without a doubt to submit oneself to a law which is strange, rather meaningless, always difficult, and sometimes atrocious ... \u00a0Let us however try to find a matter for rejoicing in this ... \u00a0The exigencies of a strict prosody are the artifice which confers upon natural language the qualities of a resistant matter.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nPerhaps the most salient characteristic of Val\u00e9ry\u2019s work and person, and certainly the one to which he himself would have attached greatest importance, was his cult of the intellectual self. His fascination and personal identification with the Narcissus myth is well documented. Of an early poem on this subject,\u00a0\u201cNarcissus Speaks\u201d\u00a0(\u201cNarcisse Parle\u201d), he wrote (quoted in volume I of\u00a0Oeuvres [Works]): \u201cThe theme of Narcissus, which I have chosen, is a sort of poetic autobiography which requires a few explanations and indications. There exists in Montpellier a botanical garden where I used to go very often when I was nineteen. In a rather secluded corner of this garden, which formerly was much wilder and prettier, there is an arch and in it a kind of crevice containing a slab of marble, which bears three words: PLACANDIS NARCISSAE MANIBUS (to placate the spirit of Narcissa). That inscription had brought on reveries in me, and here, in two words, is its story. In 1820, at this place, a skeleton was discovered, and according to local traditions, it was thought to be the tomb of the poet [Edward] Young. This girl, who died in Montpellier toward the end of the eighteenth century, couldn\u2019t be buried in the cemetery, since she was a Protestant. Her father is supposed to have buried her, on a moonlit night. The dead girl\u2019s name was Narcissa. The remains that had been found were identified as hers. For me the name Narcissa suggested Narcissus. Then I developed the idea of the myth of this young man, perfectly handsome or who found himself so in his reflection. I wrote at the time the very first\u00a0Narcissus, an irregular sonnet ... \u201d\u00a0\n\r\nWhy the young man should have been so inspired by this circumstantial evocation of the Narcissus story is perhaps suggested by a line\u2014\u201cI endlessly delight in my own brain\u201d\u2014appearing in a poem written in 1887. Indeed, Val\u00e9ry\u2019s poetic output slowed to the merest trickle from 1892 to 1912 because at that time he apparently judged literature not the best medium for \u201cenjoying his brain.\u201d\nThe events of Val\u00e9ry\u2019s life clearly influenced the development of his poetic theories and practices. He was born the same year as Proust, the year of the Paris Commune and the Franco-Prussian War: 1871. Because his mother was Italian and his father was Corsican, Val\u00e9ry was probably as comfortable speaking Italian as French. He attended school at the College de S\u00e8te, now renamed in his honor, and at the lyc\u00e9e of the nearby city of Montpellier. In 1888, he passed the\u00a0baccalaureat\u00a0and entered law school, where literature first began to strike a responsive chord in him and he began to make contacts with the Parisian literary group surrounding Mallarm\u00e9. In 1889 he read Joris Karl Huysmans\u2019s novelistic manifesto of decadence,\u00a0Against the Grain (A rebours), in which Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s poem \u201cHerodiade\u201d is discussed admiringly, and the following year he met the young writers Pierre Louis and Andr\u00e9 Gide. It was the former, editor of a small literary magazine called\u00a0La Conque, who first showed Val\u00e9ry\u2019s work to Mallarm\u00e9 and got several of his early poems into print, including\u00a0\u201cNarcissus Speaks.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nVal\u00e9ry\u2019s introduction to Gide, by Louis, began a friendship that lasted throughout Val\u00e9ry\u2019s life and that has been documented in Robert Mallet\u2019s\u00a0Self-Portraits: The Gide/Val\u00e9ry Letters, 1890-1942. Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s ambiguously positive response to Val\u00e9ry\u2019s early work was reported by Gide: [Gide to Val\u00e9ry, July 12, 1892] \u201cMy friend, Mallarm\u00e9 has given me your poems; since he criticized them, he must esteem them. I was delighted by a few that I didn\u2019t know; some of them are much less good\u2014that is, in comparison with others of your own. On reading them, I imagined them published, but Mallarm\u00e9, when I saw him again, didn\u2019t seem to think it desirable.\u201d [Val\u00e9ry to Gide, July 13, 1892] \u201c[Louis] and You are beastly Semites: one of you, for having underhandedly and covered with a cloak of distance, dared to present my vague alchemies to Mallarm\u00e9, the other of you, for having dared even more, in not repeating to me textually the precious and pure panning I deserved from the Master. [Louis] is completely mute. Whereas you merely hint. Whom shall I kill? All joking apart, you are loathsome. If I knew [Gide\u2019s friend, writer Maurice] Quillot better, I should have you poisoned. Speak then, with no fear of stating every lamentable word.\u201d [Gide to Val\u00e9ry, July 25, 1892] \u201cHere is what he said about your poems\u2014and don\u2019t have me poisoned: \u2018I\u2019m surprised that with the tact and knowledge of poetry he sometimes shows, he leaves, here and there, some that would seem to me\u00a0facile.\u2019 The remark surprised me. And that\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\r\nDespite Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s reservations, several of the poems were published.\u00a0\u201cNarcissus Speaks\u201d\u00a0was immediately celebrated by the Paris literary establishment and selected by Adolphe Van Bever and Paul Leautaud for their important anthology\u00a0Poets of Today (Poetes d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui). In fact, if not for Van Bever and Leautaud\u2019s recognition of the merit of his early work, Val\u00e9ry might have been completely forgotten during the long period when he wrote almost no poetry.\u00a0\n\r\nIn 1892, Val\u00e9ry completed work on his law degree and embarked upon an unrequited and, by his own admission, \u201cludicrous\u201d love affair. Similar more or less debilitating infatuations symptomatic of Val\u00e9ry\u2019s extreme but repressed emotionalism and sensitivity occurred throughout his life. This first love probably had something to do with the intellectual and spiritual crisis of 1892 that caused him to renounce poetry for 20 years. He took up poetry again, of course, but even as an old man he would continue to be profoundly troubled by what he regarded as the unsolvable equation of love.\n\r\nOne of his last works, a two-part dramatic work called\u00a0\u201cMy Faust\u201d (\u201cMon Faust\u201d), attempted to deal with the issue and was never completed. As Charles G. Whiting has written in\u00a0Paul Val\u00e9ry, \u201cThe unfinished play\u00a0\u2018Lust\u2019 ... remains as a testimony of his longing for a perfect communion he never found.\u201d In\u00a0\u201cLust\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0\u201cThe Solitary\u201d\u00a0(\u201cLe Solitaire\u201d), which together comprise \u201cMy Faust,\u201d\u00a0one finds the most frank treatment by Val\u00e9ry of his profound fear of sensuality. This fear probably accounts more than any other factor for his emotional crisis and 20-year renunciation of poetry, since poetry, despite his attempts to purify or sterilize it, emblemized for Val\u00e9ry a certain sensuality of mind. His fear of sensuality may also explain his violent intellectual prejudices\u2014against Freud, for instance, or against philosophy. According to Derrida, Val\u00e9ry rejected psychoanalysis and metaphysics because they focused upon meaning, and for Val\u00e9ry meaning was associated with the elevation of the physical, the sensual, over the formal properties of \u2018pure\u2019 intellect. Furthermore, Freud offered the obvious explanation of why Val\u00e9ry might so vociferously vilify a belief in and search for meaning: the mind\u2019s repressed contents are always sexual. \u201cLust\u201d\u00a0allegorizes this profound conflict, never resolved by Val\u00e9ry.\n\r\nWhiting\u2019s brief account of the play may thus help explain Val\u00e9ry\u2019s 20-year refusal to embrace poetry as a career: \u201cBefore Faust\u2019s conclusion by exhaustion of possibilities, liberation, and death, there is in\u00a0\u2018Lust\u2019\u00a0a remarkable apotheosis of\u00a0life\u00a0in the garden-scene of the second act. Here the magical, musical spell of a beautiful evening brings Faust rapidly to a high point of pure enjoyment of being ... \u00a0\u2018Lust\u2019\u00a0... attempts to synthesize extreme existence of mind and body with the extreme experience of love, even if in a very incomplete fashion. Almost from the beginning of the garden-scene Lust shows her love for Faust, and immediately after Faust\u2019s great monologue, she unconsciously places her hand upon his shoulder. Faust addresses her as \u2018tu\u2019 and there is a brief moment of emotional communion with a birth of intimacy and tenderness, those beginnings of love which Val\u00e9ry prized above all other joys. Immediately, however, Faust retreats, and the apotheosis of the garden-scene comes to an end as he turns again to the dictation of his memoirs.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nThis \u201cdictation of memoirs\u201d appears to represent Val\u00e9ry\u2019s own intellectual narcissism, the self-directed literary activity of the\u00a0Notebooks; Lust with her other-directed emotion seems to symbolize poetry that is meant to be read. Since Val\u00e9ry castigated all such audience-directed writing, he clearly must have felt comfortable with Faust\u2019s activities and motivations and anxious about Lust\u2019s. Indeed, his anxiety about Lust\u2019s appeal must have been extreme, for he was unable to finish the work. As Whiting explains, \u201cVal\u00e9ry planned a fourth act for\u00a0\u2018Lust\u2019\u00a0which would have developed the love theme but he found the project too difficult for theatrical creation, perhaps in large part because of his own defensive attitudes. Already in the first act, Faust tells Mephistopheles that he wants only tenderness, not love, from Lust ... \u00a0Love is a danger because [it is] so closely related to instincts, to the cyclical and repetitive functions of life ... \u00a0And so the intimacy of Lust and Faust is only a fleeting moment in the second act, and the too difficult fourth act was never written.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nVal\u00e9ry himself wrote in his\u00a0Notebooks\u00a0that \u201cLust and Faust are\u00a0me\u2014and nothing but me. Experience has shown me that what I wanted most is not to be found in another\u2014and cannot find the\u00a0other\u00a0capable of trying without reserve to go to the end of the will to ...\u00a0take love where it has never been.\u201d Neither the period of relative silence from 1892 to 1912 nor the resumption of a poetic vocation resolved this crisis, the dilemma of all Val\u00e9ry\u2019s life and work: he was never able to bring himself to embrace Lust, though at the end of his life he admitted that she was as integral to him as was the austere, argumentative, and intellectually prudish Faust.\u00a0\n\r\nVal\u00e9ry\u2019s crisis occurred during an October, 1892 stay in Genoa, Italy. During a stormy and sleepless night, he decided that poetry was not the loftiest and purest expression of the mind\u2019s activity. From then until 1912, he wrote little poetry, instead devoting most of his creative energies to the\u00a0Notebooks. Every morning he would get up at around five o\u2019clock and write meditations, notes, and speculations in small volumes that he intended for no one but himself. There were more than 250 of these notebooks at the end of his life, and they are not only now available in published form, but are, ironically, among the most important and most read\u2014most\u00a0public\u2014of his writings.\u00a0\n\r\nDuring the years from 1892 to 1922, Val\u00e9ry first worked as a bureaucrat in the French War Office and then as secretary to Edouard Lebey, director of the French Press Association; he attended the Tuesday evening gatherings of artists, writers, and intellectuals at the home of Mallarm\u00e9, and he married Jeannie Gobillard, a friend of Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s daughter. He continued writing his\u00a0Notebooks\u00a0and began to publish essays\u2014Introduction to the Method of Leonardo da Vinci (Introduction a la methode de Leonard de Vinci), and his inquiry into dreams,\u00a0Studies (Etudes). He also wrote and published\u00a0The Evening With Monsieur Teste (La Soiree avec Monsieur Teste, 1896), in which he created the fictional character of Edouard Teste, a paragon of intellectual austerity and self-absorption, an \u201cideal\u201d thinker, and therefore a role model for Val\u00e9ry himself. Teste might be thought of as a precursor of the figure Faust, but without the opposing figure of Lust. What Val\u00e9ry admired so much in Teste was that, as\u00a0The Evening With Monsieur Teste\u00a0reveals, he had \u201ckilled his puppet.\u201d That is, he did nothing conventional, \u201cnever smiled, nor said good morning or good night ... seemed not to hear a \u2018How are you?\u2019\u2019 In\u00a0\u201cLetter From Madame Emilie Teste\u201d (\u201cLettre de Madame Emilie Teste\u201d), Val\u00e9ry\u2019s narrator imagined in him \u201cincomparable intellectual gymnastics. This was not, in him, an excessive trait but rather a trained and transformed faculty. Here are his own words: \u2018I gave up books twenty years ago. I have burned my papers also. I scrape the quick \u00a0... \u00a0I keep what I want.\u2019\u201d\nIn 1912, Val\u00e9ry was persuaded to break his poetical fast by undertaking a major revision of his earlier poems, which would be published under the title\u00a0Album of Old Verses (Album de vers anciens)\u00a0in 1920. Suzanne Nash, in\u00a0Paul Val\u00e9ry\u2019s Album de vers anciens: A Past Transfigured, writes, \u201cVal\u00e9ry seems to have understood that any reconsideration of his own work would perforce lead him to a deeper understanding of problems fundamental to the creative process itself ... This potentially self-constitutive dimension of the\u00a0Album\u00a0was certainly for Val\u00e9ry its ultimate justification ... [Its somewhat dated tone is] the result of his intention to mount a critical engagement with his heritage, to offer a portrait gallery of predecessors whose faces emerge transfigured and transvalued according to the exigencies of a new poetics.\u201d Thus, Nash continues, \u201cThe\u00a0Album de vers anciens ... is a particularly precious and innovative poetic document, one which holds, inscribed within its structure, the poet\u2019s interpretation of his creative confrontation with his past. It represents a kind of chronicle in which the older poet seeks to recreate the intellectual crisis which led him to reject a nineteenth-century concept of poetry founded on an ethics of Symbolist idealism in favor of a poetry which claims autonomy through critical self-reference.\u201d\n\r\nBy 1920, Val\u00e9ry had already published\u00a0The Young Fate, a long, very difficult poem, to great critical and popular acclaim. He followed the\u00a0Album of Old Verses\u00a0with\u00a0Charms\u00a0(\u201csongs\u201d or \u201cincantations\u201d) in 1922, and had written his first quasi-Platonic dialogues,\u00a0Eupalinos; or, The Architect (Eupalinos; ou, L`architecte)\u00a0and\u00a0The Soul and the Dance (L\u2019Ame et la danse)\u00a0in 1921. The former dialogue treats much the same topics as\u00a0\u201cThe Seaside Cemetery\u201d (\u201cLe Cimetiere marin\u201d), probably Val\u00e9ry\u2019s best-known poem: the relationships of life and death, light and darkness, movement and stasis, which compose life itself. Phaedrus proclaims in this dialogue that \u201cnothing beautiful can be separated from life, and life is that which dies.\u201d\u00a0The Soul and the Dance\u00a0deals with the power of art to transcend individuality and the body and to reach toward the absolute.\u00a0\nIn 1922, \u00c9douard Lebey, Val\u00e9ry\u2019s employer at the French Press Association, died, and the necessity of finding a new source of income further confirmed his revived sense of a literary\u2014a publicly literary\u2014vocation. From this point until the end of his life, Val\u00e9ry was known as\u00a0the\u00a0French poet. In 1924,\u00a0Variety (Vari\u00e9t\u00e9), a collection of his essays, appeared. It contained the essay on Leonardo first published in 1895, the important article on Poe\u2019s \u201cEureka,\u201d and\u00a0\u201cVariations on a Thought\u201d (\u201cVariations sur une pensee\u201d), in which he attacked Pascal as a thinker. Val\u00e9ry would publish four more volumes of\u00a0Variety\u00a0in his lifetime. In 1925, he was elected to the French Academy, and in his 1927 inaugural speech he made the unprecedented gesture of attacking his predecessor, novelist Anatole France, probably because France, as co-editor of a literary magazine, had rejected the poetry of Mallarm\u00e9. In 1937 Val\u00e9ry was appointed to the new chair in poetry at the College de France, a position he held until his death in 1945.\nSome facts about Val\u00e9ry might predict a less than faultless comportment on Val\u00e9ry\u2019s part during World War II and France\u2019s occupation by Germany: first, he had been quietly but strongly \u201canti-Dreyfusard\u201d during the famous Dreyfus affair, in which Emile Zola and others accused the French army and government of anti-Semitism in making a scapegoat of Captain Alfred Dreyfus during his 1894 trial for treason. Among the celebrities who, along with Zola, took up Dreyfus\u2019s case were Proust, the painter Claude Monet, and Anatole France. Val\u00e9ry in fact went so far as to donate money to aid the widow of Colonel Henry, who in 1898 killed himself when it became known that he had forged the documents used to incriminate Dreyfus. \u201cThere is evidence,\u201d writes Henry Grubbs in\u00a0Paul Val\u00e9ry, \u201cto show that Val\u00e9ry was annoyed at the propaganda of his liberal friends ... and personally, at least at that moment, decidedly hostile to democracy. His preoccupation with the intellectual superman had led him to a great interest in the man wielding extreme power, the dictator, the tyrant. Examples of this are the sonnet\u00a0\u2018Cesar\u2019 ... and the references in the\u00a0Cahiers\u00a0to the Emperor Tiberius, to Napoleon, and to Caesar. A\u00a0cahier\u00a0written late in 1898 contains the following multilingual slogans: \u2018Le Cesar de soi-meme / El Cesar de sumismo / Il Cesare di se stesso / The Cesar (sic) of himself.\u2019\u201d Furthermore, Val\u00e9ry was also friendly with Marshal Philippe Petain, one of the leaders of France\u2019s pro-German Vichy government.\nHowever, the poet did prove sympathetic to the Free French Movement led by General Charles de Gaulle, and of the Nazis he wrote in \u201cWar Economy for the Mind\u201d: \u201cAs for our enemies, we, and the whole world, know that their politics with regard to the mind has been reduced or limited for ten years to repressing the developments of intelligence, to depreciating the value of pure research, to taking often atrocious measures against those who consecrated themselves to these things, to favoring, even as far as endowed chairs and laboratories, worshippers of the idol to the detriment of independent creators of spiritual richness, and they have imposed on the arts as on the sciences the utilitarian ends which a power founded on declamations and terror pursues.\u201d Moreover, his praise of Bergson was regarded as a courageous act.\u00a0\n\r\nVal\u00e9ry died on July 20, 1945, at the close of France\u2019s last 20th-century war with Germany, having been born at the conclusion of its last 19th-century one. He was given a state funeral in Paris and buried at the cemetery at S\u00e8te, his birthplace and the setting for\u00a0\u201cThe Seaside Cemetery.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nVal\u00e9ry passed on an important legacy of influence in American letters, perhaps much greater than his influence on later French poets. Yves Bonnefoy, who held Val\u00e9ry\u2019s chair in poetry at the College de France and succeeded him as the most prominent contemporary French poet, has said in\u00a0L\u2019Improbable\u00a0that Val\u00e9ry had no real influence on his own poetic development. However, the American poet Allen Tate, a well-known member of the Southern Agrarian movement that flourished particularly during the 1920s and 1930s, has recorded in his\u00a0Memoirs and Opinions, 1926-1974\u00a0that \u201cHere, in [Val\u00e9ry\u2019s] \u2018Pages Inedites\u2019 [\u2018Unpublished Pages\u2019], was a man educated in the French classical tradition and fired imaginatively by his early entretiens with Mallarm\u00e9: whose apparently casual utterances gave me something more than the shock of recognition. It was rather the sense of my own identity, of a sameness within vast, elusive differences.\u201d It may be in the enduring classicism of Southern letters, passed from Tate to such contemporary Southern writers as Reynolds Price, Fred Chappell, and James Applewhite, that Val\u00e9ry\u2019s voice, through the veil of translation, can be heard most clearly today.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"]}}
