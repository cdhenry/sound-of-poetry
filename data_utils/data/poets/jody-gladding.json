Informed by ecopoetics and the ephemeral, location-based work of Cecilia Vicu\u00f1a and Andy Goldsworthy, Gladding creates open, collaborative poems often engaged with translating, to a precise syntactical degree, the interactions between life and art, lingering in fields of close contact: areas marked by interruption, damage, or receptivity.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHer debut collection Stone Crop (1993) was chosen by James Dickey for the Yale Series of Younger Poets. She is also the author of the poetry collections Rooms and Their Airs (2009),\u00a0Translations from Bark Beetle (2014), and the spiders my arms (2018).\u00a0\u00a0Her poems, interviews, and reviews\u00a0appear\u00a0in\u00a0the periodicals\u00a0Orion,\u00a0ecopoetics, Terrain.org, and\u00a0Numero Cinq, and her poetry has been published in\u00a0The Best American Poetry 1995\u00a0(edited by\u00a0Richard Howard) and\u00a0The Arcadia Project: North American Postmodern Pastoral\u00a0(2012, edited by\u00a0Joshua Corey\u00a0and\u00a0G.C. Waldrep).\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u201cGladding\u2019s subject matter embraces both the natural and the cultural,\u201d observes Lauren Rusk in a 2009 Poets\u2019 Quarterly review of Rooms and Their Airs. Rusk adds, \u201cGladding\u2019s pieces [\u2026] take various forms, such as minimal lines, couplets, and opened out spaces (all with deftly meaningful line breaks), as well as lyric paragraphs. The form of each poem seems to me natural to the process it enacts\u2014the speaker\u2019s mind, the poem\u2019s body: one.\u201d In a 2014 interview for Milkweed Editions, Gladding discussed her process and approach to the composition of her third collection of poems, Translations from Bark Beetle: \u201cI\u2019m very interested in how poetry exists in 3-dimensional space, in physical acts, in the world at large. For me, this has led to my poems increasingly moving across the page, then off the page (sometimes coming into being as/on objects). The shapes they take on the pages of this book are the traces of that movement.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nGladding has translated about 30 works from French, including The Serpent of Stars (2004) by Jean Giono, Small Lives (2008) by Pierre Michon and Elizabeth Deshays, and Herv\u00e9 This\u2019s Kitchen Mysteries: Revealing the Science of Cooking (2007). Her recent translations include\u00a0Rimbaud the Son\u00a0by Pierre Michon (Yale University Press, 2013) and\u00a0Green: The\u00a0History of a Color\u00a0by Michel Pastoureau (Princeton University Press, 2014).\u00a0\n\r\nGladding's honors include a Whiting Writers\u2019 Award, an Academy of American Poets Prize, a Centre National du Livre de France Translation grant and a French-American Foundation Translation Award. She has also been a Stegner Fellow at Stanford University, resident poet at The Frost Place, and a fellow at the MacDowell Colony.\r\n\u00a0\r\nGladding has taught at Cornell University and currently directs the Writing Program at the Vermont Studio Center. She lives in East Calais, Vermont.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
