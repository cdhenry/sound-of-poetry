This fact puzzled his admirers and, indeed, Aiken himself, who never lost his self-confidence and who always denied the charge that his poetry might be too difficult. Benjamin DeMott considered possibilities for Aiken\u2019s lack of exposure in a Saturday Review article: \u201cThe reasons for the neglect aren\u2019t so far to seek as might be supposed. They have to do partly with this poet\u2019s reluctance to break with certain nineteenth-century conventions of sound and posture. ... Aiken has often flown against [dominant taste], writing heavy music, laying out gorgeous sound, providing no clear \u2018speaker,\u2019 no definable \u2018dramatic situation,\u2019 and pruning no modifiers.\u201d According to Alden Whitman of the New York Times, Louis Untermeyer once commented that \u201cthe poet made no effort to popularize himself or make himself in fashion.\u201d Aiken noted one curious phenomenon about his critical reception. He wrote to Malcolm Cowley that \u201ceach new book is panned\u2014but in the background is the implication that all the previous ones were good.\u201d\nA childhood tragedy left an indelible impression on Aiken. When he was 11, his father shot first Aiken\u2019s mother and then himself. Aiken related the circumstances of his parents\u2019 death in his autobiography, Ushant: \u201cAfter the desultory early-morning quarrel, came the half-stifled scream, and the sound of his father\u2019s voice counting three, and the two loud pistol shots and he tiptoed into the dark room, where the two bodies lay motionless, and apart, and, finding them dead, found himself possessed of them forever.\u201d It has been suggested that much of Aiken\u2019s interest in psychology stemmed from that shattering incident. Aiken once said that his short story \u201cSilent Snow, Secret Snow\u201d (a psychological portrait of a disturbed boy) was \u201ca projection of my own inclination to insanity.\u201d According to Richard Hauer Costa, writing in the Nation, Aiken was \u201cat all times an \u2018I\u2019 writer. He neither could nor wished to separate his life from his work.\u201d Aiken imbued much of his writing with psychological themes, frequently using the metaphor of a voyage to signify a journey to self-knowledge. Jennifer Aldrich noted in the Sewanee Review, \u201cThree of Aiken\u2019s five novels, many of his short stories, and his first long poetic series, The Divine Pilgrim, as well as some of the later poems, were all written in the physical form of a journey. The actual vehicles of these journeys seem ... to be in some way a symbol for consciousness; and the goal is the self.\u201d Throughout his career, Aiken measured his characters\u2019 progress along the voyage with a Freudian yardstick. Psychological themes were sometimes explored in unconventional formal structures. In a preface to his Three Novels: Blue Voyage, Great Circle, King Coffin (1965), Aiken wrote, \u201cGreat Circle, written five years after Blue Voyage, is just as insistently psychological in its approach to its theme, but less closely tethered to my own personality than its predecessor. ... My early and continued preoccupation with musical form was allowed greater play.\u201d\nOther early impressions reflected in Aiken\u2019s philosophy and writing were formed at Harvard, where he showed interest in the work of\u2014among others\u2014Henry and William James, Walt Whitman, the Symbolists, and the English Romanticists. In one case, an admired writer\u2019s style was baldly reproduced in Aiken\u2019s work. Alden Whitman reported in the New York Times that in his maturity Aiken called his first book of verse, Earth Triumphant, and Other Tales in Verse (1914), \u201ca dead steal from [John] Masefield.\u201d Aiken was aware that critics considered his style imitative, and at times he responded humorously to such suggestions. In 1918, for example, he wrote a dream dialogue in which Ezra Pound said, \u201cSwinburne plus Fletcher minus Aiken equals Aiken,\u201d and Louis Untermeyer responded, \u201cEliot plus Masters minus Aiken equals Aiken.\u201d Aiken discussed the issue of influence more seriously with Robert Hunter Wilbur in a Paris Review interview. The work of T.S. Eliot, a friend from Harvard days, had had a \u201ctremendous influence\u201d on him, said Aiken; but there had also been \u201ca lot of interchange\u201d in their relationship. As Aiken phrased it, \u201cthe juices went both ways.\u201d\nA Harvard acquaintance to whom Aiken gave great credit was a professor of his, George Santayana. In the Paris Review interview, Aiken asserted that it was Santayana who shaped his \u201cview of what poetry would ultimately be.\u201d Santayana\u2019s personal philosophy and his emphasis on the philosophical content of poetry were enormously appealing to Aiken. According to Jennifer Aldrich in the Sewanee Review, when Aiken was \u201cinvited to give his notions of what poetry should be\u201d he turned to the following passage from Santayana\u2019s Three Philosophical Poets: \u201cFocus a little experience, give some scope and depth to your feeling, and it grows imaginative; give it more scope and more depth, focus all experience within it, make it a philosopher\u2019s vision of the world, and it will grow more imaginative in a superlative degree, and be supremely poetical. ... Poetry, then, is not poetical for being short-winded or incidental, but on the contrary, for being comprehensive and having range. If too much matter renders it heavy, that is the fault of the poet\u2019s weak intellect, not of the outstretched world.\u201d\nAiken produced much of his most important work in the 1920s and early 1930s, even though this period was one of personal upheaval for the author, including a divorce from his first wife and a suicide attempt. Between 1934 and 1936, Aiken wrote under the pseudonym of Samuel Jeake, Jr. as London correspondent for the New Yorker. Following his divorce in 1939 from his second wife and his remarriage, Aiken returned to the United States and settled in New England, where he wrote poetry mainly about the area.\nWhile Aiken admired many writers early in his career, that number decreased sharply with the passing years. His views, always vehement, became increasingly vitriolic. In an interview with Harvey Briet in 1950, he called William Faulkner \u201cthe great American genius, the only adult writer of fiction we\u2019ve had in the last twenty years on a major scale.\u201d In 1969, he could name no such leader. He told Alden Whitman of the New York Times, \u201cI think we\u2019re going through a very depressing decline in taste. ... I don\u2019t think there is any first-rate fiction, and I mean to include everybody in that\u2014Nabokov, Bellow, and so on.\u201d In Whitman\u2019s opinion, Aiken had \u201cscarcely a kind word for anybody or anything except comic strips, martinis and Conrad Aiken.\u201d\nPoets fared no better than novelists in Aiken\u2019s assessment of the state of writing. In 1968 he told Wilbur in the Paris Review, \u201cI think we\u2019ve come to a kind of splinter period in poetry. These tiny little bright fragments of observation\u2014and not produced under sufficient pressure\u2014some of it\u2019s very skillful, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anywhere a major poet in the process of emerging.\u201d Aiken had strong words, too, for anything resembling clubbiness. He once wrote that poets \u201creally stink. Especially in large numbers, when herding.\u201d Patricia Reynolds Willis, writing for the Georgia Review, recorded his feelings about writers\u2019 colonies: \u201cOne writer by himself is bad enough, but if you get five in a room, it\u2019s terrible. And I doubt if anything good comes of it. It\u2019s much better to just go and hire a room in a lodging house and sequester yourself there in the city, and just get lost. But at those places, you\u2019ve got a little sacred cabin out in the woods and have your own little lunch put at your doorstep at one p.m., and you are supposed to sit there and produce like a hen in a hen factory.\u201d\nI.A. Richards felt that Aiken was more gracious than the above comments would indicate. Richards wrote in a Times Literary Supplement review of the Selected Letters of Conrad Aiken, \u201cFew poets can have made greater efforts or faced more reasonably deprivation of recognition. His truly prodigious output met with curiously intermittent appreciation, periods of long neglect being taken with unflagging endurance and resolution. Along with this went a truly noteworthy immunity to those infections of jealousy and envy which afflict so many of us.\u201d The kindness Aiken showed to Malcolm Lowry, acting as a sort of father figure to the young writer, was noted by critics; and Richards noted that \u201chis joy ... when he can really go all out in praise ... knows no bounds.\u201d Confident of his stature among peers, Aiken was modest when it came to the question of his place in history. Replying to a schoolboy who had praised his work, Aiken once wrote, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have any great notion about where I stand as a poet. That will be taken care of by those wiser people who come later on the scene than we do. Thus, as in their turn, those opinions too will be revalued over and over. None of us knows in what direction poetry and those other arts will turn\u2014that\u2019s part of the cruel fascination of being interested in the arts as you are, and keeping your head about it.\u201d\nAiken died in 1973 in his birthplace, Savannah, Georgia. The Letters of Conrad Aiken and Malcolm Lowry, 1929-1954, published in 1992, reveals the literary development of these two men through their long-term correspondence to each other and the accompanying illustrations, drafts, chronologies, and editorial notes. Canadian Literature reviewer Paul Tiessen suggested that Aiken\u2019s letters were \u201cassurances of real touch-stones of gain and loss within more or less objectifiable personal and literary worlds.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
