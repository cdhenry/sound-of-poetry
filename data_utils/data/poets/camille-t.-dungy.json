Dungy was born in Denver but moved often as her father, an academic physician, taught at many different medical schools across the country. She earned a BA from Stanford University and an MFA from the University of North Carolina, Greensboro.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDungy\u2019s full-length poetry publications include Trophic Cascade (2017); Smith Blue\u00a0(2011), a finalist for the William Carlos Williams Award from the Poetry Society of America;\u00a0Suck on the Marrow (2010), winner of an American Book Award, a California Book Award silver medal, and the Northern California book award; and the sonnet collection What to Eat, What to Drink, What to Leave for Poison (2006), a finalist for both the PEN Center USA Literary Award and the Library of Virginia Literary Award. Describing the poems in What to Eat, What to Drink, What to Leave for Poison as \u201crogue sonnets,\u201d Dungy said of the poems\u2019 speakers in a 2007 Boxcar Review interview, \u201cThese are folks who take the restrictions and traditions that have been handed to them and they do what they can to make beautiful things with their lives [\u2026] so the fact that the sonnets follow some rules and flaunt others is a direct reflection of their subjects.\u201d In a 2009 review of the same collection for Pembroke Magazine, Tara Betts observed that the collection \u201coffers a number of ways to look at what is considered to be a part of nature, whether it is a part of the plants or the people that inhabit a place.\u201d As Betts later noted, \u201cThis tension of living close to passion and death simultaneously creates urgency in these quiet poems.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAddressing the paucity of African American poets in anthologies of nature poetry, Dungy stated in a 2010 interview for the Oakland Tribune, \u201cI miss seeing writers of color in the conversation. Until we have greater variety in the conversation, it is not a conversation\u2014it is a monologue.\u201d To that end, Dungy edited Black Nature: Four Centuries of African American Nature Poetry (2009), which won\u00a0a Northern California Book Award and\u00a0was nominated for an NAACP Image Award. She was also co-editor of From the Fishouse: An Anthology of Poems that Sing, Rhyme, Resound, Syncopate, Alliterate, and Just Plain Sound Great (2009), and assistant editor for Gathering Ground: A Reader Celebrating Cave Canem\u2019s First Decade (2006). Dungy's most recent work includes the essay collection Guidebook to Relative Strangers: Journeys into Race, Motherhood, and History (2017).\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nDungy has won the Dana Award and the Sustainable Arts Foundation Promise Award, and\u00a0was a finalist for the NAACP Image Award in 2010 and 2011.\u00a0Dungy has also received fellowships and awards from the National Endowment for the Arts, the American Antiquarian Society, the Virginia Commission for the Arts, Cave Canem, the Bread Loaf Writers\u2019 Conference, the Djerrasi Resident Artist Program, Yaddo, Virginia Center for Creative Arts, and the Norton Island Artist Residency Program.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently a professor in the creative writing program at San Francisco State University, Dungy is currently a professor in the English department at Colorado State University. She\u00a0lives in Colorado with her husband and daughter.\r\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\n\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
