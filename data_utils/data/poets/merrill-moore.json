Moore earned his BA and MD from Vanderbilt University, where he became associated with a group of young poets known as the Fugitives. His first poems were published under the pen name \u201cDendric\u201d in their literary magazine, the Fugitive. \n\r\nMoore wrote many thousands of sonnets during his lifetime\u2014at least 50,000. Described as distinctly American by critic Louis Untermeyer, Moore\u2019s sonnets were conversational, loose, and syncopated. He published more than 40 collections of poetry, including The Noise That Time Makes (1929), Six Sides to a Man: New Sonnets (1935), Clinical Sonnets (1949), A Doctor\u2019s Book of Hours Including Some Dimensions of the Emotions (1955), and Experimental Sonnets (1956).\r\n\u00a0\r\nMoore moved to Boston in 1930 and became a practicing psychiatrist specializing in alcoholism and suicide. He served in World War II, earning a Bronze Star and an Army Commendation medal. He was a friend of Robert Frost and Robert Lowell; Frost once described Moore as a \u201cserious physician and serious artist [who] had no notion of being taken lightly; still there was something of the rogue there that was a part of his great charm. He seldom cracked a smile.\u201d Moore died in Quincy, Massachusetts.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
