Her subtle, restrained style was partially influenced by writers such as Rilke and Henry James, and partially by the English metaphysical poets such as\u00a0George Herbert,\u00a0John Donne, and\u00a0Henry Vaughan, though she distanced herself from her intellectually rigorous, metaphysical contemporaries. Some critics have placed her in a category of\u00a0brilliant minor poets described as the \u201creactionary generation.\u201d Aware of the success and modern pretentions of\u00a0Ezra Pound\u00a0and\u00a0T.S. Eliot, Bogan and others chose to use traditional techniques, though her poetry is modern and emotive without being sentimental, and her language is immediate and contemporary. Bogan\u2019s poetry contains a personal quality derived from personal experience, but it is not private or confessional. Her poems, most critics agree, are economical in words, masterpieces of crossed rhythms in which the meter opposes word groupings. Brett C. Millier named Bogan \u201cone of the finest lyric poets America has produced.\u201d However, Millier wrote, \u201cthe fact that she was a woman and that she defended formal, lyric poetry in an age of expansive experimentation made evaluation of her work, until quite recently, somewhat condescending.\u201d She also reviewed poetry for the New Yorker for 38 years, becoming one of America\u2019s most astute critics for almost two generations.\n\r\nLouise Bogan was born in Maine, the daughter of a mill worker. Her parents\u2019 marriage was not a happy one, due largely to her mother\u2019s mental and emotional instability. As the Bogans moved from one New England mill town to the next, May Bogan indulged in numerous extramarital affairs, which she flaunted. She also mystified her family with frequent and lengthy disappearances. Millier proposed that \u201cthe difficulties and instabilities of her childhood produced in Bogan a preoccupation with betrayal and a distrust of others, a highly romantic nature, and a preference for the arrangements of art over grim, workaday reality.\u201d\n\r\nBogan showed academic promise early, and through the help of a benefactor she was able to attend the Girls\u2019 Latin School in Boston. Then, after her freshman year at Boston University, she won a scholarship to Radcliffe College but turned it down to move to New York City with her husband. The couple eventually moved to the Panama Canal Zone, where she wrote some of the poems that would appear in her early collections. Bogan and her husband separated in 1919, and he died of pneumonia a year later. She moved to Vienna, where she lived a writer\u2019s life of solitude for three years. When she returned to live in New York in 1923, she worked in a bookstore and with cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead. She quickly became friends with such influential literary figures as\u00a0Malcolm Cowley,\u00a0L\u00e9onie Adams,\u00a0William Carlos Williams,\u00a0Conrad Aiken, and Edmund Wilson.\n\nBody of This Death\u00a0(1923) was her first volume of poetry, and it \u201ccontains several of Bogan\u2019s most memorable poems and in general reveals its author\u2019s preoccupations and tastes,\u201d wrote Millier. \u201cBetrayal, particularly sexual betrayal, is a constant theme.\u201d The critic found these poems, like Bogan\u2019s poetry in general, to be \u201cmade of meticulously distilled experience, distanced from the source by objective language.\u201d Several in the collection \u201caddress specifically female concerns and point to Bogan\u2019s ambivalent relationship with the tradition of female lyric poets.\u201d Millier added: \u201cHer poems are by no means dogmatically feminist; Bogan held a deep distrust for all ideological commitment. In fact, she has been castigated somewhat unfairly by contemporary feminists.\u201d She followed this book with\u00a0Dark Summer\u00a0(1929), which included new poems along with several poems from\u00a0Body of This Death.\u00a0\n\r\nBogan\u2019s third book of poetry,\u00a0Sleeping Fury\u00a0(1937), further established Bogan as a modern master. A\u00a0Books\u00a0review said Bogan \u201chas achieved a mastery of form rare in the realm of modern poetry. There is creative architecture in even the slightest of her lyrics. Miss Bogan works not as a landscape painter (while her visual imagery is exact, it does not depend on color alone), nor yet as a musician\u2014although in many of her poems, the auditory imagery is superior to the visual: the ear listens, even as the eye sees. Her art is that of a sculpture.\u201d A\u00a0Nation\u00a0critic wrote, \u201cDistinguished is the word one always thinks of in connection with Louise Bogan\u2019s poetry. Whatever form she tries, her art is sure, economical, and self-definitive. There is never in her poems a wasted adjective or phrase but always perfect clarity and a consistent mood precisely set down. She can write the completely artless lyric or the very subtle poem worked out through complex imagery.\u201d\n\r\nReviewing\u00a0Poems and New Poems\u00a0(1941) in\u00a0Saturday Review,\u00a0William Rose Benet noted, \u201cHer poetry is, and always has been, intensely personal. She has inherited the Celtic magic of language, but has blended it somehow with the tartness of New England.\u201d Marianne Moore\u00a0further observed in\u00a0Nation, \u201cLouise Bogan\u2019s art is compactness compacted. Emotion with her, as she has said of certain fiction is \u2018itself form, the kernel which builds outward form from inward intensity.\u2019 She uses a kind of forged rhetoric that nevertheless seems inevitable.\u201d\n\nCollected Poems, 1923-1953\u00a0was reviewed in the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0by\u00a0Richard Eberhart. \u201cLouise Bogan\u2019s poems adhere to the center of English with a dark lyrical force,\u201d wrote Eberhart. \u201cWhat she has to say is important. How she says it is pleasing. She is a compulsive poet first, a stylist second. When compulsion and style meet, we have a strong, inimitable Bogan poem.\u201d Saturday Review\u00a0commented, \u201cLouise Bogan is mistress of precise images and commands an extensive range of poetic accents and prosodic effects; she is also a musician, whose notes are as crystalline as those of Chopin\u2019s Preludes. More than this, one cannot read far in her pages without realizing that at the core of her poetry is mind-stuff which it is fashionable to call metaphysical.\u201d These poems are also important because they deal intelligently with the themes of sexual love and bodily decay.\n\nThe Blue Estuaries: Poems, 1923-1968\u00a0was the final collection of poems published before Bogan\u2019s death. The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0reviewed the book: \u201cNow that we can see the sweep of forty-five years work in this collection of over a hundred poems, we can judge what a feat of character it has been. ... [Her diction] stems from the severest lyrical tradition in English. ... [Her language is] as supple as it is accurate, dealing with things in their own tones.\u201d\n\r\nWith the assistance of\u00a0William Jay Smith, Bogan compiled an anthology of poems for children.\u00a0The Golden Journey: Poems for Young People,\u00a0with poems ranging from Shakespeare to\u00a0Dylan Thomas, was described by\u00a0James Dickey\u00a0as possibly \u201cthe best general anthology of poems for young people ever compiled. By the poems they present, by their arrangement and timing, the editors subtly hold out the possibility that a child\u2014though a child\u2014is capable of rising to good poems, and so of becoming, through an encounter which also requires much of him, something more than he was. \u2026 [This book] could have been selected only by poets as distinguished as these two, and by human beings who realize that to make the wrong concessions to children is injurious to them.\u201d\n\r\nBogan also wrote a great deal of criticism.\u00a0Achievement in American Poetry, 1900-1950\u00a0was a brief account of American poetry during the first half of the 20th\u00a0century. The\u00a0Chicago Tribune\u00a0described the book as \u201ca delight. Like all Miss Bogan\u2019s criticism, this book is full of acute, spirited, and authoritative judgments of writers and works, expressed with grace and wit.\u201d The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0added, \u201cLouise Bogan not only manages to compress a formidable amount of factual information into her small compass but also contrives to do a great deal of satisfactory talking about her facts.\u201d The\u00a0United States Quarterly Book Review\u00a0commented, \u201cMiss Bogan\u2019s clarity of style, her ability to compress a great deal of information into a few lucid, interesting phrases, and her severely just appraisal form the chief attractions of this volume.\u201d\n\r\nCommenting in the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0on Bogan\u2019s criticism,\u00a0Thomas Lask declared that she \u201ctook a median position between the New Criticism at one end and sociological (or Marxian) criticism at the other. She refused to identify the poet with the historical processes of his age. ... On the other hand, she was not willing to strip the work down to its formal elements only, as if the poet was a disembodied muse living in no fixed time or place and without those idiosyncrasies that made him what he was and no other. There is also little poking around in myth or in depth psychology.\u201d Lask found that Bogan\u2019s \u201cmanner was so quiet, her style so unemphatic that they sometimes obscured the force of her judgments. ... She could be wrong and she could be disappointing in her pieces, which is to say that she was mortal. An exquisite and scrupulous craftsman with a leaning to order, she had a natural tendency to respond to formal workmanship.\u201d\n\r\n\"Louise Bogan is a great lyric poet,\u201d concluded Paul Ramsey in\u00a0Iowa Review. \u201cTo say that some of her lyrics will last as long as English is spoken is to say too little. For since value inheres in eternity, the worth of her poems is not finally to be measured by the length of enduring. To have written \u2018Song for the Last Act,\u2019 \u2018Old Countryside,\u2019 \u2018Men Loved Wholly beyond Wisdom,\u2019 \u2026 and some dozens of other poems of very nearly comparable excellence is to have wrought one of the high achievements of the human spirit, and to deserve our celebration and our love.\u201d\n\r\nBogan died in 1970, at her home in Manhattan. She was 72.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"], "School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
