She is the author of the poetry collections This One Tree (2006), which was awarded the New Issues Poetry Prize by judge William Olson, Permission (2013), and The Accounts (2013), which won the Rilke Prize. Peterson\u2019s lyric poems explore interior and exterior landscapes, exposure, and shelter. \u201cA poem is a place,\u201d Peterson stated in an interview with the Harvard Gazette. \u201cIt does not describe a place.\u201d In her artist\u2019s statement, Peterson explains, \u201cI like a poem that feels logical but is not\u2014a poem in which thinking takes the shape of a hallucination. I like a poem in which all of my intelligence fails. I am forced to use other tools: desire, anger, recklessness. I pursue beauty and memory not to preserve them but to try, against odds, to preserve that perishable pursuit.\u201d \u00a0 Peterson has been a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, the Bread Loaf Writers\u2019 Conference, and the Summer Literary Seminars and received a grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts. She has taught at Bennington College and Deep Springs College, where she was the Robert B. Aird Chair of Humanities.
