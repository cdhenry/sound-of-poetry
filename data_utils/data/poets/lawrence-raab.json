He earned a BA from Middlebury College and an MA from Syracuse University and has taught at various institutions including American University, the University of Michigan, and Williams College, where he is the Morris Professor of Rhetoric.\nRaab is the author of many collections of poetry, including The Life Beside This One (2017); Mistaking Each Other for Ghosts (2015), which was a finalist for the National Book Award; The History of Forgetting (2009); Visible Signs: New and Selected Poems (2003); and What We Don\u2019t Know About Each Other (1993), selected for the National Poetry Series by Stephen Dunn and a finalist for the National Book Award. He collaborated with Stephen Dunn on a chapbook of poems, Winter at the Caspian Sea (1999). \nConversational yet precise, Raab\u2019s lyrical meditations trace human fallibility and doubt. As Boston Review critic Don Colburn noted in a review of What We Don\u2019t Know About Each Other, \u201cLawrence Raab\u2019s gracefully haunting poems explore the fine lines of our temporal lives\u201a between distance and intimacy, limits and possibility, present and past \u2026 In Raab\u2019s poems, reason and faith are not as far apart as they sometimes seem.\u201d\nIn addition to his poetry, Raab has written the screenplays The Distances (1967) and Or I\u2019ll Come to You (1968). The Birds, his adaptation of a play by Aristophanes, was first produced at the Power Center in Ann Arbor in 1975. Raab has been an editor for Frontiers and a member of the editorial board of Alkahest.\nRaab\u2019s honors include the Bess Hokin Prize from Poetry magazine, the Academy of American Poets Prize, and the Charity Randall Citation from the International Poetry Forum. He has also received grants and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Massachusetts Council on the Arts, the Bread Loaf Writers\u2019 Conference, the University of Michigan Society of Fellows, the Peter S. Reed Foundation, and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. Raab\u2019s poetry has been featured in The Norton Anthology of Poetry (1983), A Book of Luminous Things (1996, ed. Czeslaw Milosz), and several volumes of Best American Poetry.\nHe lives in Williamstown, Massachusetts.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
