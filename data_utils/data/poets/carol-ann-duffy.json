Her verses, as an\u00a0Economist\u00a0reviewer described them, are typically \u201cspoken in the voices of the urban disaffected, people on the margins of society who harbour resentments and grudges against the world.\u201d Although she knew she was a lesbian since her days at St. Joseph\u2019s convent school, her early love poems give no indication of her homosexuality; the object of love in her verses is someone whose gender is not specified. With her 1993 collection,\u00a0Mean Time,\u00a0and 1994\u2019s\u00a0Selected Poems, she would begin to also write about queer love.\n\r\nDuffy\u2019s poetry has always had a strong feminist edge, however. This position is especially well captured in her\u00a0first collection, Standing Female Nude,\u00a0in which the title poem consists of an interior monologue comprising a female model\u2019s response to the male artist who is painting her image in a Cubist style. Although at first the conversation seems to indicate the model\u2019s acceptance of conventional attitudes about beauty in art\u2014and, by extension, what an ideal woman should be\u2014as the poem progresses Duffy deconstructs these traditional beliefs. Ultimately, the poet expresses that \u201cthe model cannot be contained by the visual art that would regulate her,\u201d explained DiMarco. \u201cAnd here the way the poem ends with the model\u2019s final comment on the painting \u2018It does not look like me\u2019\u2014is especially instructive. On the one hand, her response suggests that she is naive and does not understand the nature of Cubist art. On the other hand, however, the comment suggests her own variableness, and challenges traditionalist notions that the naked model can, indeed, be transmogrified into the male artist\u2019s representation of her in the nude form. To the model, the painting does not represent either what she understands herself to be or her lifestyle.\u201d\n\r\nA Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, Duffy is also the United Kingdom\u2019s poet laureate, the first woman to be appointed the position in 400 years. She was seriously considered for the position in 1999. Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s administration had wanted a poet laureate who exemplified the new \u201cCool Britannia,\u201d not an establishment figure, and Duffy was certainly anything but establishment. She is the Scottish-born lesbian daughter of two Glasgow working-class radicals. Her female partner is also a poet and the two of them are raising a child together. Duffy has a strong following among young Britons, partially because her poetry collection\u00a0Mean Time\u00a0was included in Britain\u2019s A-level curriculum, but Blair was worried about how \u201cmiddle England\u201d would react to a lesbian poet laureate. There were also concerns in the administration about what Britain\u2019s notorious tabloids would write about her sexuality, and about comments that Duffy had made urging an updated role for the poet laureate. In the end, Blair opted for the safe choice and named Andrew Motion to the post.\n\r\nAfter Duffy had been passed over, Katherine Viner wrote in the\u00a0Guardian Weekend\u00a0that her \u201cpoems are accessible and entertaining, yet her form is classical, her technique razor-sharp. She is read by people who don\u2019t really read poetry, yet she maintains the respect of her peers. Reviewers praise her touching, sensitive, witty evocations of love, loss, dislocation, nostalgia; fans talk of greeting her at readings \u2018with claps and cheers that would not sound out of place at a rock concert.\u2019\u201d Viner lamented that Duffy only came to the attention of many people when she was caricatured and rejected as poet laureate. However, the poet got some satisfaction when she earned the National Lottery award of 75,000 pounds, a sum that far exceeded the stipend that poet laureates receive.\n\r\nAfter the laureate debacle, Duffy was further vindicated when her next original collection of poems,\u00a0The World\u2019s Wife,\u00a0received high acclaim from critics. In what\u00a0Antioch Review\u00a0contributor Jane Satterfield called \u201cmasterful subversions of myth and history,\u201d the poems in this collection are all told from the points of view of the women behind famous male figures, both real and fictional, including the wives and lovers of Aesop, Pontius Pilate, Faust, Tiresias, Herod, Quasimodo, Lazarus, Sisyphus, Freud, Darwin, and even King Kong. Not all the women are wives, however. For example, one poem is told from Medusa\u2019s point of view as she expresses her feelings before being slain by Perseus; \u201cLittle Red-Cap\u201d takes the story of Little Red Riding Hood to a new level as a teenage girl is seduced by a \u201cwolf-poet.\u201d These fresh perspectives allow Duffy to indulge in a great deal of humor and wit as, for example, Mrs. Aesop grows tired of her husband\u2019s constant moralizing, Mrs. Freud complains about the great psychologist\u2019s obsession with penises, Sisyphus\u2019s bride is stuck with a workaholic, and Mrs. Lazarus, after finding a new husband, has her life ruined by the return of her formerly dead husband. There are conflicting emotions as well in such poems as \u201cMrs. Midas,\u201d in which the narrator is disgusted by her husband\u2019s greed, but, at the same time, longs for something she can never have: his physical touch. \u201cThe World\u2019s Wife\u00a0appeals and astonishes,\u201d said Satterfield. \u201cDuffy\u2019s mastery of personae allows for seamless movement through the centuries; in this complementary chorus, there\u2019s voice and vision for the coming ones.\u201d An\u00a0Economist\u00a0reviewer felt that the collection \u201cis savage, trenchant, humorous and wonderfully inventive at its best.\u201d And Ray Olson, in\u00a0Booklist,\u00a0concluded that \u201cDuffy\u2019s takes on the stuff of legends are \u2026 richly rewarding.\u201d\nDuffy\u2019s recent collections include her Collected Poems (2015), The Bees (2011), winner of the Costa Poetry Award and shortlisted for the T.S. Eliot Prize; and Rapture (2005), winner of the T.S. Eliot Prize. Duffy has also written verses for children. Her several collections of children\u2019s poetry include The Gift (2010), New and Collected Poems for Children (2009), and The Hat (2007).\nIn addition to her original poetry, Duffy has edited numerous anthologies,\u00a0including To the Moon: An Anthology of Lunar Poems (2009) and Answering Back (2009), and has adapted eight classic Brothers Grimm fairy tales in\u00a0Grimm Tales.\u00a0Not intended for young children but for older children and young adults in drama and English classes,\u00a0Grimm Tales\u00a0includes adaptations of such stories as \u201cHansel and Gretel\u201d and \u201cThe Golden Goose,\u201d which are rewritten \u201cwith a poet\u2019s vigor and economy, combining traditions of style with direct, colloquial dialogue,\u201d according to Vida Conway in\u00a0School Librarian.\nDuffy is a professor of contemporary poetry and\u00a0the creative director of the Writing School at Manchester Metropolitan University. She lives in Manchester.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Scotland"]}}
