At Colby College, where he earned his BA, he studied American Studies and creative writing. He earned an MFA at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and also studied poetry at Stanford University as a Wallace Stegner fellow.\nRoderick\u2019s first book,\u00a0Blue Colonial\u00a0(2006), was chosen by Robert Pinsky as winner of the\u00a0APR/Honickman Prize. Set in Plymouth, the book uses dramatic and narrative effects to explore the burdens of historical inheritance: vanished Native American tribes, the seeds of American culture, and our physical and psychological encroachment upon the natural landscape.\nThe Pitt Poetry Series published Roderick\u2019s second book,\u00a0The Americans, in 2014. Poet and critic David Rivard writes of\u00a0The Americans: \u201cLike Robert Frank in his great photo essay of the same name, Roderick has some news for us: not only do we not know where we\u2019ve come from, we don\u2019t know where we are. With care and a restorative watchfulness, he has made terrific poetry out of our drifting in the fog.\u201d\nRoderick\u2019s poetry has also been honored with the Campbell Corner Poetry Prize, a Dorothy Sargent Rosenberg Prize, and the Amy Lowell Traveling Scholarship. He teaches in the MFA Writing Program at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
