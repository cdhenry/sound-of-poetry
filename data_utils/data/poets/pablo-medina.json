He earned both a BA and an MA from Georgetown University. Medina is the author of more than a dozen books of fiction, poetry, memoir, and translation. His work in both Spanish and English explores identity, language, and place, often through narratives of exile and memory. In the Indiana Review, Medina meditates on exile as the condition of identity and the source of creative work: \u201cThe exile, I know this firsthand, has lost the place where he was and turned it into the source of his myths, the root of his longing, and the aroma of his despair,\u201d Medina writes. \u201cFor the Cuban, who had his exile coursing through his blood, nostalgia is, has always been, the cradle and grave of his passions. He cannot love without invoking loss and he cannot sing without his mouth filling with grief. The exile has two births\u2014that which brings him into the world and that which brings him into exile\u2014both dominated by the trauma of expulsion.\u201d\n\r\nMedina\u2019s collections of poetry include Arching into the Afterlife (1991), The Floating Island (1999), The Man Who Wrote on Water (2011), the photography and poetry book Calle Habana (2013, with Carlos Ordonez), and The Island Kingdom (2015). He is the author of the memoir Exiled Memories: A Cuban Childhood (1990) and three novels: The Marks of Birth (1994), The Return of Felix Nogara (2000), and Cubop City Blues (2012).\n\r\nWith Carolina Hospital, Medina co-translated the writings of Cuban dissident Tania Diaz Castro in Everyone Will Have to Listen/Todos me van a tener que o\u00edr (1990). And with poet Mark Statman, Medina translated Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca\u2019s Poet in New York (2008) in a translation that John Ashbery described as \u201cthe definitive version of Lorca's masterpiece.\u201d Medina also translated the selected poems of Cuban writer Virgilio Pi\u00f1era in The Weight of the Island (2014).\n\r\nMedina is the recipient of numerous honors and awards for his writing and translations, including fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Lila Wallace-Reader\u2019s Digest Fund, the United States Department of State, the Oscar B.
