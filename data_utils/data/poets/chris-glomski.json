Glomski studied poetry at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, where he discovered some of his most significant influences in the poets of the New York School, in particular James Schuyler. After spending some time in Italy in the early 1990\u2019s, Glomski earned his PhD in creative writing from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).\nGlomski is the author of three full-length collections of poetry, most recently Lit Up\u00a0(The Cultural Society, 2017) and\u00a0The Nineteenth Century and Other Poems\u00a0(The Cultural Society, 2011). In a recent review of Lit Up for The Carolina Quarterly, Kylan Rice observes that when \u201cGlomski evicts the \u2018I\u2019 from his lyrics, he leaves out what leaves out; what provincializes a poem with a single, limited frame of reference. In doing so, he tries to secure for poetry a better strategy for owning up to and negotiating the super-saturation of [our present] media environment.\u201d\u00a0 For Rice, \u201cGlomski is the fl\u00e2neur for an online epoch\u2014he closes the laptop and exits the apartment of the self for the broad day of the mobilized crowd.\u201d\nAs a Senior Lecturer and instructor of writing in UIC\u2019s Department of English, Glomski\u2019s research interests include contemporary poetics, the history of English and American poetry, the visual arts, popular music, and Italian literature. He is also a translator of contemporary Italian poetry.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
