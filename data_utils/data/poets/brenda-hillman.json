Often described as \u201csensuous\u201d and \u201cluminescent,\u201d Hillman\u2019s poetry investigates and pushes at the possibilities of form and voice, while remaining grounded in topics such as geology, the environment, politics, family, and spirituality. In an interview with Sarah Rosenthal, Hillman described her own understanding of form: \u201cIt is the artist\u2019s job to make form. Not even to make it, but to allow it. Allow form. And all artists have a different relationship to it, and a different philosophy of it \u2026 I think that when you are trying to open up a territory\u2014in this case I was working with a desire to open the lyric\u2014you have to be greedy, in that you want more than you can do. And you\u2019re always bound to fail.\u201d Praising Hillman\u2019s deft handling of form and subject, Marjorie Welish wrote, \u201cEach poem \u2026 creates its own experimental configuration, within which the phrase swerves and discombobulates sense, as several registers of subject complicate the sampling of experiences and also as the experimental format throws the lyric into symbolic disarray one moment and naturalist scrutiny the next. And even more: she writes as if the lyric poem had a political calling.\u201d\nBorn in 1951 in Tucson, Arizona, Hillman earned degrees at Pomona College and the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. The author of over 10 books of poetry, she has received numerous awards for her work including fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Academy of American Poets, the Poetry Society of America, as well as a Pushcart Prize and the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Award. Her collection\u00a0Bright Existence\u00a0(1993) was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, and\u00a0Loose Sugar\u00a0(1997) a finalist for the National Book Critic\u2019s Circle Award. She cotranslated Ashur Etwebi\u2019s Poems from Above the Hill (2011), Jeongrye Choi\u2019s Instances (2011), and Ana Cristina Cesar\u2019s At Your Feet (2018); and edited or coedited several volumes, including The Pocket Emily Dickinson\u00a0(2009). A professor of creative writing, she holds the Olivia Filippi Chair in Poetry at St. Mary\u2019s College, in Moraga, California.\nHillman\u2019s early poetry collections received critical praise for their transfiguration of experience. With the publication of\u00a0Loose Sugar,\u00a0however, Hillman acquired a formidable reputation in the world of contemporary poetry.\u00a0Cascadia\u00a0(2001) and\u00a0Pieces of Air in the Epic\u00a0(2003) both use complicated structures to achieve what\u00a0Forrest Gander\u00a0has called \u201cpoetic architectures.\u201d Hillman spoke to\u00a0Poets and Writers\u00a0about her process of composition in\u00a0Cascadia:\u00a0\u201cOne of the ideas I got from Andr\u00e9 Breton when I read him in college is the use of chance as anchor. I would arbitrarily choose words and make myself use them to anchor the rest of the writing to the page \u2026 in the long poem, \u2018A Geology,\u2019 the corner words \u2018anchor\u2019 the rest of the poem to the page so it wouldn\u2019t float.\u201d\nConcerned with pop culture, the landscape of California, and the ethics of collective identity,\u00a0Cascadia\u00a0became the opening volume of Hillman\u2019s proposed tetralogy about the classical life elements of air, water, earth, and fire.\u00a0Pieces of Air in the Epic\u00a0and\u00a0the Los Angeles Times Book Prize-winning Practical Water\u00a0(2010) followed. The fourth volume in the series,\u00a0Seasonal Works With Letters on Fire\u00a0(2013), was longlisted for the National Book Award and received the 2014 International Griffin Poetry Prize. Reviewing\u00a0Practical Water\u00a0for the\u00a0Boston Review,\u00a0Craig Morgan Teicher\u00a0spoke to Hillman\u2019s process: \u201cHillman has charted her own unusual course, borrowing things\u2014a mixture of conversational and high-lyric diction, an emphasis on language\u2019s materiality, an interest in metaphysics and occult knowledge, and a passionate environmental and political consciousness\u2014from pretty much every major poetic movement of the last century.\u201d\u00a0Practical Water\u00a0even includes transcripts from congressional hearings, in which Hillman\u2014who is an activist for social and environmental justice as well as a poet\u2014 tries to \u201cseek out the humanity behind policy and policymakers.\u201d\nHillman\u2019s most recent book is Extra Hidden Life, among the Days (2018). It is \u201cperhaps her most radical poetry collection yet,\u201d wrote Major Jackson on the Academy of American Poets website. It\u2019s \u201cfull of celebrations of those who keep fighting the good fight, or \u2026 devoted their lives to resisting. This is a collection that invites all of us to \u2018Angrily [Stand] Outside in the Wind.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
