Reiss produced over 300 reviews.\u00a0\nIn\u00a0The New York Times Book Review, critic Helen Vendler wrote: \u201cIn Reiss, poems are laid in drawers, folded in books; memories are like pictures cut out of magazines, inertia and insomnia are the two forms of life. Pursued by the same phantoms,\u00a0which reappear on the telephone, in sequential rooms, in snapshots, in slides, Reiss writes them down in an accomplished plain style, with a momentum carrying whole poems along on\u00a0the humming acceleration of a single sentence.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nReiss was also the author of two novels: When Yellow Leaves (2016) and Facade for a Penny Arcade (2017). He was a professor of English at Miami University, where he was a founding editor of Miami University Press. He died in late 2016 in Wilmette, Illinois.\n", "attrs": {}}
