Born in Lithuania, where his parents moved temporarily to escape the political upheaval in their native Poland, he left Poland as an adult due to the oppressive Communist regime that came to power following World War II and lived in the United States from 1960 until his death in 2004. Milosz\u2019s poems, novels, essays, and other works are written in his native Polish and translated by the author and others into English. Having lived under the two great totalitarian systems of modern history, national socialism and communism, Milosz wrote of the past in a tragic, ironic style that nonetheless affirmed the value of human life. While the faith of his Roman Catholic upbringing was severely tested, it remained intact. Terrence Des Pres, writing in the Nation, stated that \u201cpolitical catastrophe has defined the nature of our [age], and the result\u2014the collision of personal and public realms\u2014has produced a new kind of writer. Czeslaw Milosz is the perfect example. In exile from a world which no longer exists, a witness to the Nazi devastation of Poland and the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe, Milosz deals in his poetry with the central issues of our time: the impact of history upon moral being, the search for ways to survive spiritual ruin in a ruined world.\u201d\n\r\nBorn in Lithuania in 1911, Milosz spent much of his childhood in Czarist Russia, where his father worked as a civil engineer. After World War I the family returned to their hometown, which had become a part of the new Polish state, and Milosz attended local Catholic schools. He published his first collection of poems, Poemat o czasie zastyglym (\u201cPoem of the Frozen Time\u201d), at the age of 21. Milosz was associated with the catastrophist school of poets during the 1930s. The writings of this group of poets ominously foreshadowed World War II; when the war began in 1939, and Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, Milosz worked with the underground Resistance movement in Warsaw, writing and editing several books published clandestinely during the occupation. One of these books, a collection titled Wiersze (\u201cPoems\u201d), was published under the pseudonym J. Syruc. Following the war, Milosz became a member of the new communist government\u2019s diplomatic service and was stationed in Paris, France, as a cultural attach\u00e9. In 1951, he left this post and defected to the West.\n\nThe Captive Mind (1953), his first collection of essays, explains Milosz\u2019s reasons for defecting and examines the life of the artist under a communist regime. Karl Jaspers, in an article for the Saturday Review, described The Captive Mind as \u201ca significant historical document and analysis of the highest order \u2026 In astonishing gradations Milosz shows what happens to men subjected simultaneously to constant threat of annihilation and to the promptings of faith in a historical necessity which exerts apparently irresistible force and achieves enormous success. We are presented with a vivid picture of the forms of concealment, of inner transformation, of the sudden bolt to conversion, of the cleavage of man into two.\u201d Milosz defected when he was recalled to Poland from his position at the Polish embassy. He refused to leave. Joseph McLellan of the Washington Post quoted Milosz explaining: \u201cI knew perfectly well that my country was becoming the province of an empire.\u201d In a speech before the Congress for Cultural Freedom, quoted by James Atlas of the New York Times, Milosz declared: \u201cI have rejected the new faith because the practice of the lie is one of its principal commandments and socialist realism is nothing more than a different name for a lie.\u201d After his defection Milosz lived in Paris, where he worked as a translator and freelance writer. In 1960 he was offered a teaching position at the University of California, Berkeley, which he accepted. He became an American citizen in 1970.\n\r\nIn The Seizure of Power, first published in France as La Prise du pouvoir in 1953, Milosz renders as fiction much of the same material found in The Captive Mind. The book is an autobiographical novel that begins with the Russian occupation of Warsaw at the close of World War II. The novel ends with the disillusioned protagonist, a political education officer for the communists, immigrating to the West. After living in the United States for a time, Milosz began to write of his new home. In Native Realm: A Search for Self-Definition (1968) and Visions from San Francisco Bay (1982), Milosz compares and contrasts the West with his native Poland. Native Realm, Richard Holmes wrote in the London Times, is \u201ca political and social autobiography, shorn of polemic intent, deeply self-questioning, and dominated by the sense that neither historically nor metaphysically are most Westerners in a position to grasp the true nature of the East European experience since the First War.\u201d\n\r\nIn Visions from San Francisco Bay Milosz examines his life in contemporary California, a place far removed in distance and temperament from the scenes of his earlier life. His observations are often sardonic, and yet he is also content with his new home. The opening words of the book are \u201cI am here,\u201d and from that starting point Milosz describes the society around him. \u201cThe intention,\u201d noted Julian Symons in the Times Literary Supplement, \u201cis to understand himself, to understand the United States, to communicate something singular to Czeslaw Milosz.\u201d Although Milosz\u2019s comments about life in California could be oblique and arch, \u201cunderlying all his meditations,\u201d commented Leon Edel in the New York Times Book Review, \u201cis his constant \u2018amazement\u2019 that America should exist in this world\u2014and his gratitude that it does exist.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe story of Milosz\u2019s odyssey from East to West is also recounted in his poetry. Milosz\u2019s \u201centire effort,\u201d Jonathan Galassi explained in the New York Times Book Review, \u201cis directed toward a confrontation with experience\u2014and not with personal experience alone, but with history in all its paradoxical horror and wonder.\u201d Speaking of his poetry in the essay collection The Witness of Poetry (1983), Milosz stresses the importance of his nation\u2019s cultural heritage and history in shaping his work. \u201cMy corner of Europe,\u201d he states, \u201cowing to the extraordinary and lethal events that have been occurring there, comparable only to violent earthquakes, affords a peculiar perspective. As a result, all of us who come from those parts appraise poetry slightly differently than do the majority of my audience, for we tend to view it as a witness and participant in one of mankind\u2019s major transformations.\u201d \u201cFor Milosz,\u201d Helen Vendler explained in the New Yorker, \u201cthe person is irrevocably a person in history, and the interchange between external event and the individual life is the matrix of poetry.\u201d\n\r\nMilosz articulated a fundamental difference in the role of poetry in the capitalist West and the communist East. Western poetry, as Alfred Kazin wrote in the New York Times Book Review, is \u201c\u2018alienated\u2019 poetry, full of introspective anxiety.\u201d But because of the dictatorial nature of communist government, poets in the East cannot afford to be preoccupied with themselves. They are drawn to write of the larger problems of their society. \u201cA peculiar fusion of the individual and the historical took place,\u201d Milosz wrote in The Witness of Poetry, \u201cwhich means that events burdening a whole community are perceived by a poet as touching him in a most personal manner. Then poetry is no longer alienated.\u201d\n\r\nFor many years Milosz\u2019s poetry was little noticed in the United States, though he was highly regarded in Poland. Recognition in Poland came in defiance of official government resistance to Milosz\u2019s work. The communist regime refused to publish the books of a defector; for many years only underground editions of his poems were secretly printed and circulated in Poland. But in 1980, when Milosz was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, the communist government was forced to relent. A government-authorized edition of Milosz\u2019s poems was issued and sold a phenomenal 200,000 copies. One sign of Milosz\u2019s widespread popularity in Poland occurred when Polish workers in Gdansk unveiled a monument to their comrades who were shot down by the communist police. Two quotations were inscribed on the monument: one was taken from the Bible; the other was taken from a poem by Milosz.\n\r\nThe Nobel Prize also brought Milosz to the attention of a wider audience in the United States. After 1980 several of his earlier works were translated into English, while his new books received widespread critical attention. The poet\u2019s image also graced a postage stamp in Poland. Some of this public attention focused less on Milosz\u2019s work as poetry than \u201cas the work of a thinker and political figure; the poems tend to be considered en masse, in relation either to the condition of Poland, or to the suppression of dissident literature under Communist rule, or to the larger topic of European intellectual history,\u201d as Vendler maintained. But most reviewers have commented on Milosz\u2019s ability to speak in a personal voice that carries with it the echoes of his people\u2019s history. Critic Paul Zweig explained that Milosz \u201coffers a modest voice, speaking an old language. But this language contains the resources of centuries. Speaking it, one speaks with a voice more than personal \u2026 Milosz\u2019s power lies in his ability to speak with this larger voice without diminishing the urgency that drives his words.\u201d\n\r\nBecause he lived through some of the great upheavals of 20th-century Eastern Europe, and because his poetry fuses his own experiences with the larger events in his society, many of Milosz\u2019s poems concern loss, destruction, and despair. Milosz believed that one of the major problems of contemporary society\u2014in both the East and the West\u2014is its lack of a moral foundation. Writing in The Land of Ulro, he finds that modern man has only \u201cthe starry sky above, and no moral law within.\u201d Speaking to Judy Stone of the New York Times Book Review, Milosz stated: \u201cI am searching for an answer as to what will result from an internal erosion of religious beliefs.\u201d Because of his moral vision Milosz\u2019s writings make strong statements, some of which are inherently political in their implications. \u201cThe act of writing a poem is an act of faith,\u201d Milosz claimed in The History of Polish Literature (1969; 1983), \u201cyet if the screams of the tortured are audible in the poet\u2019s room, is not his activity an offense to human suffering?\u201d Yet Milosz also warned of the dangers of political writing. In a PEN Congress talk reprinted in the Partisan Review, he stated: \u201cIn this century a basic stance of writers \u2026 seems to be an acute awareness of suffering inflicted upon human beings by unjust structures of society. \u2026 This awareness of suffering makes a writer open to the idea of radical change, whichever of many recipes he chooses \u2026 Innumerable millions of human beings were killed in this century in the name of utopia\u2014either progressive or reactionary, and always there were writers who provided convincing justifications for massacre.\u201d\n\r\nIn The Witness of Poetry Milosz argues that true poetry is \u201cthe passionate pursuit of the Real.\u201d He condemns those writers who favor art for art\u2019s sake or who think of themselves as alienated, and suggests, as Adam Gussow wrote in the Saturday Review, that poets may have \u201cgrown afraid of reality, afraid to see it clearly and speak about it in words we can all comprehend.\u201d What is needed in \u201ctoday\u2019s unsettled world,\u201d Gussow explained, are poets who, \u201clike Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare, will speak for rather than against the enduring values of their communities.\u201d Many critics noted his concern for a poetry that confronts reality. Helen Vendler wrote that \u201cthe work of Milosz reminds us of the great power that poetry gains from bearing within itself an unforced, natural, and long-ranging memory of past customs; a sense of the strata of ancient and modern history; wide visual experience; and a knowledge of many languages and literatures \u2026 The living and tormented revoicing of the past makes Milosz a historical poet of bleak illumination.\u201d\n\r\nWith the publication in 1986 of Unattainable Earth, Milosz continued to show himself as a poet of memory and a poet of witness, for, in the prose footnote to \u201cPoet at Seventy,\u201d he wrote of his continued \u201cun-named need for order, for rhythm, for form, which three words are opposed to chaos and nothingness.\u201d The book was the first of several lauded collaborative translations between the author and American poet Robert Hass. A year later, The Collected Poems, 1931-1987 was published, bringing together Selected Poems, Bells in Winter, The Separate Notebooks, and Unattainable Earth into one volume. The book contains 180 poems ranging in size from two lines to 60 pages. 45 poems appear for the first time in English, of which 26 were recently translated older poems and 20 new poems. New York Times Book Review contributor Edward Hirsch found the volume \u201cone of the monumental splendors of poetry in our age.\u201d Baranczak believed that it is a book that can \u201cfinally give the English-speaking reader a fairly accurate idea of what [Milosz\u2019s] poetry really is, both in the sense of the largeness of its thematic and stylistic range and the uniqueness of his more than half-century-long creative evolution.\u201d\n\r\nMilosz followed in 1991 with Provinces: Poems, 1987-1991. For Milosz, the life in each individual seems made up of provinces, and one new province which he must now visit is the province of old age. He explores getting older in the 13-part sequence titled, \u201cA New Province,\u201d reporting that, \u201cnot much is known about that country / Till we land there ourselves, with no right to return.\u201d Hirsch found that these poems about old age have \u201ca penetrating honesty\u201d derived from \u201ca powerful dialectical tension, a metaphysical dispute at work \u2026 about the conflicting claims of immanence and transcendence, the temporal and the eternal.\u201d In the 1990s, Milosz also published a series of books of essays and occasional pieces, including Beginning with My Streets: Essays and Recollections, published in 1992, which closes with his 1980 Nobel lecture, and A Year of the Hunter, published in 1994, a journal Milosz penned between August of 1987 and August of 1988.\n\r\nIn 1995 Milosz published the poetry collection Facing the River: New Poems. This volume includes verse that deals largely with Milosz\u2019s return to Vilnius, the city of his childhood, now the capital of the free republic of Lithuania. Facing the River is not just about Milosz\u2019s return to Lithuania and the people that he misses; it also addresses the poet\u2019s accomplishments and his views on life. In \u201cAt a Certain Age,\u201d Milosz declares that old men, who see themselves as handsome and noble, will find: \u201clater in our place an ugly toad / Half-opens its thick eyelid / And one sees clearly: \u2018That\u2019s me.\u2019\u201d In 1999, at age 88, Milosz published Roadside Dog, a collection \u201cthat at first encounter seems an invitation to revisit the remembered landscapes of his life,\u201d as Jaroslaw Anders noted in the New Republic. In \u201cmaxims, anecdotes, meditations, crumbs of worldly wisdom, introspections \u2026 [and] poems,\u201d Milosz takes readers on a trip through the sounds and images that have shaped his life as a poet. Milosz remained active even as he advanced into his nineties. In 2001 he published Milosz\u2019s ABCs, a brief, alphabetical collection of entries illustrating his experiences and view on life. And that year, Milosz published a translation of a work first published in 1957 in his native language: A Treatise on Poetry. This lengthy poetic work has four parts which ponder Europe at the turn of the 20th century, Poland between the two world wars that devastated it, World War II, and the proper place of the poet in the world after the horror of World War II. It also serves as an historical survey of Polish poetry throughout those periods. It is a work that is \u201cgripping, profound and beautiful,\u201d according to a writer for the Economist. Translated nearly 50 years after it was written, A Treatise on Poetry found an audience among a new generation of readers. Nicholas Wroe quoted Milosz in the Guardian as commenting: \u201cIt has been a great pleasure to see my poem apparently not getting old \u2026 It is really a history of Polish poetry in the 20th century, in connection to history and the problems of so-called historical necessity. And I am proud of having written a poem that deals with historical, political and aesthetic issues even though, of course, I know that for students, the parts of the poem where I deal with Hegelian philosophy and Marxism are, for them, completely exotic. They have such short memories.\u201d The year 2001 also saw the publication of another major collection of Milosz\u2019s poems, New and Collected Poems, 1931-2001.\n\r\nMilosz also published a collection of essays in 2001, titled To Begin Where I Am: Selected Essays. The essays also form a kind of autobiography, beginning with an account of the poet\u2019s life on his grandparents\u2019 farm in Lithuania and proceeding on through the tumultuous decades that followed. Milosz has frequently been pointed out as rather unusual in that he maintained his Catholic faith even through the horrors of two World Wars; many intellectuals who survived that time subsequently suffered crises of faith from which they never recovered. \u201cMilosz\u2019s work is something so extraordinary in our epoch, that it seems to be a phenomenon that he has appeared on the surface of contemporary art from the mysterious depths of reality,\u201d declared Krzysztof Dybciak in World Literature Today. \u201cAt a time when voices of doubt, deadness, and despair are the loudest; when writers are outstripping each other in negation of man, his culture, and nature; when the predominant action is destruction \u2026 the world built by the author of \u2018Daylight\u2019 creates a space in which one can breathe freely, where one can find rescue. It renders the world of surfaces transparent and condenses being. It does not promise any final solutions to the unleashed elements of nature and history here on earth, but it enlarges the space in which one can await the Coming with hope. Milosz does not believe in the omnipotence of man, and he has been deprived of the optimistic faith in the self-sufficiency of a world known only through empirical experience. He leads the reader to a place where one can see\u2014to paraphrase the poet\u2019s own formula regarding time\u2014Being raised above being through Being.\u201d\n\r\nMilosz died in Krakow, Poland in 2004. In 2011, Yale University held the \u201cMilosz and America\u201d conference at the Beinecke Library, where Milosz\u2019s papers are held.\r\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Poland"]}}
