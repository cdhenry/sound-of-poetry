Dan Chiasson described her poems as \u201cMiltonic, Marxist, ornate, and indignant,\u201d adding that \u201cher real subject is finally how the loveliness of craft measures experience at its most brute and awful, and how experience ruptures even the loveliest of craft.\u201d Concerning The Displaced of Capital, Ellen Nussbaum wrote that Winters \u201cbuilds legacies to urban poverty that balance between lyricism and manifesto.\u201d\n\r\nWinters is fluent in French, and her translations include Salamander: Selected Poems of Robert Marteau (1979). She has traveled widely in Europe and was a Fellow at the Camargo Foundation in France. Her awards include grants from the Ingram Merrill Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, a Guggenheim fellowship, and an Award in Literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. She teaches at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
