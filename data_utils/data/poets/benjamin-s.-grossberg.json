He is the author of the chapbook The Auctioneer Bangs His Gavel (2006), winner of the Wick Poetry Chapbook Series, and the full-length poetry collections Underwater Lengths in a Single Breath (2007) and Sweet Core Orchard (2009), winner of a 2010 Lambda Literary Award.  \u00a0 Grossberg\u2019s book Sweet Core Orchard was named after an orchard that he managed in Ohio, and rural living often informs his work. Poet and critic Alfred Corn found Grossberg to be \u201cone who intertwines a survey of human sexuality (and gay sexuality at that) with theological questions \u2026 one who writes fables using the ordinary materials of daily reality; one who balances the Jewish sources of the Western tradition with its Hellenic counterpart...\u201d \u00a0 Grossberg has been the recipient of a Pushcart Prize as well as an Artist Fellowship from the Ohio Arts Council. He has taught English and creative writing at Antioch University in Ohio and the University of Hartford. He is the assistant editor of the Antioch Review.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
