As his commitment to his Orthodox Jewish faith deepened, November stopped writing poetry and enrolled in yeshiva, until, with his rabbis\u2019 encouragement, he began to write again after two years\u2019 silence.\u00a0He is the author of the poetry collections\u00a0Two Worlds Exist\u00a0(2016) and\u00a0God\u2019s Optimism\u00a0(2010), which won the\u00a0Main Street Rag\u00a0Poetry Book Award and was a finalist for the\u00a0LA Times\u00a0Book Prize, the Autumn House Poetry Prize, and the\u00a0Tampa Review\u00a0Prize for Poetry.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn his poems, November tracks the shifting intersection of faith, daily life, and poetry. In a 2010 interview with Ed Litvak for The Lo-Down, November stated, \u201cI think it\u2019s important to explore how most people, even if they look as if everything is in order, are facing challenges. Art that doesn\u2019t express conflict always falls flat because it\u2019s not true to human experience.\u201d In a review of God\u2019s Optimism for The Jewish Daily Forward, Eve Grubin observes, \u201cNovember\u2019s craft is elegant, with its simple imagery and confident end-stopped lines; however, what makes his writing stand out are his two years in yeshiva, which provide the poems with a spiritual foundation.\u201d\u00a0His poetry has been featured on Garrison Keillor\u2019s National Public Radio program \u201cThe Writer\u2019s Almanac,\u201d has won Prairie Schooner\u2019s Bernice Slote Award and has been nominated for two Pushcart Prizes.\r\n\u00a0\r\nNovember has taught at Rutgers University and Touro College. He lives with his family in Morristown, New Jersey.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
