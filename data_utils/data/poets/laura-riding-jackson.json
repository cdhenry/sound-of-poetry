She \u201cwas still in her thirties when she published her 477-page Collected Poems in 1938,\u201d reported Paul Auster in the New York Review of Books. \u201cAt an age when most poets are just beginning to come into their own,\u201d he continued, \u201cshe had already reached maturity.\u201d Riding\u2019s oeuvre included volumes of poetry, collections of critical essays and short fiction, novels, and the founding of her own small publishing firm, Seizin Press. In the 1920s and 1930s, as Auster related, she \u201cbecame an important force of the international avant-garde.\u201d Her work was highly praised by some distinguished critics, including Robert Fitzgerald, who wrote in the Kenyon Review, \u201cOf all the contemporary poems I know, these seem to me the furthest advanced, the most personal and the purest.\u201d\nRiding first came to public notice when she attracted the attention of the Fugitives, a group of American Southern writers centered at Vanderbilt University. Members of the group included John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate, and Robert Penn Warren. Their activities included meetings for the reading and discussion of poetry and philosophy, and they published their own poetry magazine, The Fugitive, which appeared from 1922 to 1925. They were searching for new criteria to apply to poetry, and Riding\u2019s work suited them perfectly. In 1923 The Fugitive commended her first published poem for its \u201cquality of originality,\u201d and in 1924 hailed her work as \u201cthe discovery of the year.\u201d She was soon invited to join the group, and her acceptance was announced in March 1925, as cause for \u201cgeneral felicitations.\u201d\nSeveral years later, working with the English poet and novelist Robert Graves, Riding furthered the aims of the group with A Survey of Modernist Poetry, \u201cthe implicit critical and theoretical principles of which,\u201d noted A.T.K. Crozier in the Fontana Biographical Companion to Modern Thought, \u201cshe developed in two works of dazzling argument, Contemporaries and Snobs (1928) \u2026 and Anarchism Is Not Enough (1928).\u201d The Survey introduced a new method for close textual criticism, showing that minute examination of a good poem finds within it truths not communicable in any other way. Its influence contributed greatly to the school of thought that became known as \u201cThe New Criticism.\u201d Riding\u2019s fiction is also important and \u201cundeservedly neglected,\u201d in the opinion of Nancy Carol Joyner and Allison Hersh, writing in the Reference Guide to American Literature. They noted that Progress of Stories, \u201cmarked by impressive variety and a somewhat flamboyant wit, is unlike her poetry in tone although it treats similar themes of truth, self, unity, and perfection. She has deliberately adopted a lighter vein for these stories, she explains in the preface, because she is tired of the accusation of obscurity and being made \u2018a scape goat\u2019 for the incapacity of people to understand what they only pretend to want to know.\u2019\u201d\nIt is for her poetry, however, that Riding is best known, and her poems reflect her commitment to write with truth. \u201cIn poem after poem,\u201d declared Auster, \u201cwe witness her trying somehow to peel back the skin of the world in order to find some absolute and unassailable place of permanence, and because the poems are rarely grounded in a physical perception of that world, they tend, strangely, to exist in an almost purely emotional climate, created by the fervor of this metaphysical quest.\u201d Her poems \u201care highly compressed, intellectual, disciplined, and possess a number of other virtues no longer much in evidence. \u2026 At their best, they have some of the concentration of language so memorable in Emily Dickinson, while the syntactic difficulty and elaborate conceits [T.S.] Eliot did so much to revive have been practiced in her poems with remarkable effect,\u201d remarked James Atlas in Poetry magazine.\nSome readers have found Riding\u2019s poetry difficult to understand; it also has been difficult to find, as she often refused to have it published in anthologies. Her poems, however, are well worth the reader\u2019s time and attention, according to various critics. Contemporary Poets contributor Alan Clark wrote of Riding\u2019s work, \u201cSome of the poems will be found immediately lucid. Others, the kind to which the long-celebrated difficulty is attributed, will make one stop\u2014not just \u2018stop and think\u2019 but stop and read. If this necessity is \u2018difficulty,\u2019 it is associated with the virtues of the poems, and contributory to a happy consequence in the immediate freshness they have on return to them. The language has precision, but also litheness of expression-movement; it is language alive and at work. Because there is a right way in, and no other way, one may feel puzzled or dazzled until it is found.\u201d Sandra M. Gilbert, reviewing First Awakenings: The Early Poems of Laura Riding\u00a0(1992) for Poetry magazine, opined that \u201ca taste for Riding\u2019s poetry has to be more diligently cultivated than an appreciation of, say, wizened olives,\u201d but noted that Riding produced \u201ca substantial body of compellingly quirky work.\u201d Her use of repetition and plays on words led some critics to compare her with Gertrude Stein. As Joyner and Hersh pointed out, \u201cFor Riding, as for Stein, poetic meaning can not only be found in words of the poem; it is also produced in the spaces between words, in the sparks that result from the collision of words and in the static created by the repetition of language.\u201d\nMany of Riding\u2019s poems deal with gender roles, although, Gilbert reported, \u201cshe passionately repudiated most critical efforts to identify her writings as in any way feminist.\u201d A recurring theme in The Close Chaplet (1926), Riding\u2019s first poetry collection, is \u201cthe difficulty of being a woman with a mind,\u201d commented Joyce Wexler in the Dictionary of Literary Biography. Then in the poem \u201cThe Tiger\u201d from Love as Love, Death as Death (1928), Riding \u201caccuses men of preventing her from knowing lust by failing to conceive of a woman who can be proud and wise as well as sensual,\u201d Wexler observed. Death is another subject that figures frequently in Riding\u2019s poetry. In 1929, distressed over a romantic entanglement, she tried to kill herself by leaping from a window; the poems she wrote in the early 1930s are \u201chalting first steps in Riding\u2019s exploration of death,\u201d Wexler explained. By the end of the decade, \u201cRiding was even able to link the widespread fear of a \u2018Next Great War\u2019 to her own appreciation, after her suicide attempt, of the value of death as the end of a limited point of view,\u201d Wexler wrote. \u201cAs Europe faced World War II, Riding regarded the collective suicide of a culture as an opportunity to awaken truth.\u201d Riding\u2019s final poems show her in a mellower frame of mind and with \u201cconfidence that she had mastered language,\u201d according to Wexler. These poems, she noted, \u201cexpress a serene understanding of the relationships between men and women, the individual and humanity, language and thought.\u201d\nIn 1939, Riding and Graves stayed with critic Schuyler B. Jackson in Pennsylvania. Riding later married Jackson, and they moved to Wabasso, Florida in 1940. Shortly after, Riding gave up poetry, because she found it incompatible with truth. Donald Davie, reviewing anonymously for the Times Literary Supplement, stated that \u201conce Keats had declared \u2018Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty,\u2019 seeming to affirm an indissoluble unity [between the two], it was inevitable that sooner or later there would appear a poet who, having believed in Keats\u2019s assurance, would find that it didn\u2019t square with experience, and would be honest enough to say so.\u201d Her major aim in writing, according to Harry Mathews in the New York Review of Books, \u201cwas to make articulate in the experience of her readers a knowledge of life that is both true and nonconceptual. It was as if she wanted to make the mechanisms of language, usually so approximate and reductive, accurate enough in the effect of their working to initiate the reader willy-nilly into an awareness of what she felt to be the pure, unmediated truth.\u201d Poetry, she felt, could no longer do this. After her husband\u2019s death in 1968, she continued the linguistic work alone, completing in 1974 the as-yet-unpublished book, Rational Meaning: A New Foundation for the Definition of Words. Her book The Telling (1972) was, in Crozier\u2019s description, \u201ca considered restatement of the revelation of universal truth possible in personal speech.\u201d\nRiding once explained herself to Contemporary Authors as follows: \u201cAt the beginning of the \u2018forties, [I] made the drastic decision that [I] must renounce poetry, as imposing irremovable obstacles to the realizing of the full potential afforded by language, when words are used faithfully, as they mean, of general human speaking, writing, in what [I] called, in an introduction to a reading of [my] poems in 1962 on a British Broadcasting programme, \u2018the style of truth.\u2019 [My] work on language was accompanied by a long look at not only poetry and literature but the entire human scene, historical and contemporary, with clarifying perception of the so far largely unfulfilled responsibility that human beings have of telling the \u2018one story\u2019 of their being, and the world\u2014the central theme of all [my] earlier work. [I] came to think that this story required a personal truth exceeding literary, poetic, and all other categorically professionalized intellectual points of view, and linguistic styles. [My] book, The Telling, which sets forth this \u2018personal gospel,\u2019 as [I call] it, has \u2026 been received in some quarters with devoted excitement, but with almost total \u2018patently deliberate avoidance of notice\u2019 in the literary press of both countries in which it was published.\u201d\nWexler commented that Riding\u2019s \u201cpursuit of truth, as she conceived it, ministered to her deepest spiritual needs. \u2026 Her inner need for certainty determined both her conception of truth and the tenacity with which she upheld it.\u201d Wexler, however, thought it too bad that this pursuit led Riding to give up poetry: \u201cRiding\u2019s poetry justified her faith in words as the ground of her being, but the poet\u2019s wisdom lost its compelling force when uprooted from her poems. Her preoccupation with definitions and literal meaning was responsible for the precision of her poems. When she transferred her principles to general speech, however, they became an obstacle to her ability to communicate and failed to generate a practical example for others to follow.\u201d Still, Wexler granted that Riding\u2019s \u201cwork is unique in its single focus on language as the source of meaning and in the quality of poetry that singleness produced.\u201d\nJackson died in Wabasso, Florida in 1991.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"], "School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
