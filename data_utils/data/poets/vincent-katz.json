He is also co-author of Fantastic Caryatids (2017), a collaboration with Anne Waldman. Interested in perception, panorama, and the layered rhythms of contemporary experience, Katz was described as a \u201c21st century fl\u00e2neur\u201d by Raphael Rubinstein; his deceptively casual lines are often compared to New York School poets such as Frank O\u2019Hara and Edwin Denby. Katz\u2019s many book collaborations with artists include Alcuni Telefonini with Francesco Clemente (2008), Judge with Wayne Gonzales (2007), and two books with James Brown, Voyages (1994, 2000) and Hyde Park Boulevard (2000), among others.\n\r\nHis translations of Latin poetry include Charm: Sextus Propertius (1995) and The Complete Elegies of Sextus Propertius (2004), which won a National Translation Award.

With Vivien Bittencourt, he made a documentary on Burckhardt called Man in the Woods: The Art of Rudy Burckhardt. The film was shown at the Montreal International Film Festival in 2004. Katz and Bittencourt also worked together on the film Kiki Smith: Squatting the Palace, which was presented at many festivals and screened at the Film Forum in New York City in 2007.\n\r\nKatz curated a museum exhibition on Black Mountain College and edited the exhibition catalogue Black Mountain College: Experiment in Art (2002, 2013).
