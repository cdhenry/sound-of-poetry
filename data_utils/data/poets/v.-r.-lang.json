Lang", "yob": "1924", "yod": "1956", "image": null, "bio": "\nPoet, playwright, and actress Violet Ranney \u201cBunny\u201d Lang grew up in Boston. She attended the University of Chicago and during World War II joined the Canadian Women\u2019s Army Corps. She later served as an editor of the Chicago Review and returned to New York City after the war, where she became associated with the New York School of poets. A close friend of the poet Frank O\u2019Hara, Lang appears in many of his poems.\r\n\u00a0\r\nLang\u2019s own poems are at once wry and elegiac, frequently making use of serial metaphors. During her lifetime, Lang published widely in respected literary journals and wrote and starred in two verse dramas: Fire Exit (1952) and I Too Have Lived in Arcadia (1954). She was a founding member of the Poets\u2019 Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where both of these plays were performed.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHer writing is collected in V.R. Lang: Poems and Plays, With a Memoir by Alison Lurie (1975). A selection of her papers is housed at Harvard University\u2019s Houghton Library. Lang died of Hodgkin\u2019s disease in 1956, at the age of 32.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
