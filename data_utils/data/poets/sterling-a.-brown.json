Brown", "yob": "1901", "yod": "1989", "image": null, "bio": "\nSterling\u00a0Allen\u00a0Brown devoted his life to the development of an authentic black folk literature. A poet, critic, and teacher at Howard University for 40 years, Brown was one of the first people to identify folklore as a vital component of the black aesthetic and to recognize its validity as a form of artistic expression. He worked to legitimatize this genre in several ways. As a critic, he exposed the shortcomings of white literature that stereotypes blacks and demonstrated why black authors are best suited to describe the negro experience. As a poet, he mined the rich vein of black Southern culture, replacing primitive or sentimental caricatures with authentic folk heroes drawn from Afro-American sources. As a teacher, Brown encouraged self-confidence among his students, urging them to find their own literary voices and to educate themselves to be an audience worthy of receiving the special gifts of black literature.\nOverall, Brown\u2019s influence in the field of Afro-American literature has been so great that scholar Darwin T. Turner told\u00a0Ebony\u00a0magazine: \u201cI discovered that all trails led, at some point, to\u00a0Sterling\u00a0Brown. His\u00a0Negro Caravan\u00a0was\u00a0the\u00a0anthology of Afro-American literature. His unpublished study of Afro-American theater was\u00a0the\u00a0major work in the field. His study of images of Afro-Americans in American literature was a pioneer work. His essays on folk literature and folklore were preeminent. \u2026 Brown was and is the literary historian who wrote the Bible for the study of Afro-American literature.\u201d\nBrown\u2019s dedication to his field was unflinching, but it was not until he was in his late sixties that his work received widespread public acclaim. Before then, he labored in obscurity on the campus of Howard University. His fortune improved in 1968 when the Black Consciousness movement revived an interest in his work. In 1969, two of his most important books of criticism,\u00a0Negro Poetry and Drama\u00a0and\u00a0The Negro in American Fiction,\u00a0were reprinted by Argosy; five years later, in 1974, Beacon Press reissued\u00a0Southern Road,\u00a0his first book of poems. These reprintings stimulated a reconsideration of the author, which culminated in the publication of\u00a0The Collected Poems of\u00a0Sterling\u00a0A.\u00a0Brown\u00a0in 1980. More than any other single publication, it is this title, which won the 1982 Lenore Marshall Poetry prize, that brought Brown the widespread recognition that he deserved.\nBecause he had largely stopped writing poetry by the end of the 1940s, most of\u00a0Collected Poems\u00a0is comprised of Brown\u2019s early verse. Yet the collection is not the work of an apprentice, but rather \u201creveals Brown as a master and presence indeed,\u201d in the view of a\u00a0Virginia Quarterly Review\u00a0critic. While acknowledging that \u201chis effective range is narrow,\u201d the critic calls Brown \u201ca first-rate narrative poet, an eloquent prophet of the folk, and certainly our finest author of Afro-American dialect.\u201d Scholar Henry Louis Gates appreciated that in\u00a0Collected Poems, \u201cBrown never lapses into bathos or sentimentality. His characters confront catastrophe with all of the irony and stoicism of the blues and of black folklore. What\u2019s more, he is able to realize such splendid results in a variety of forms, including the classic and standard blues, the ballad, the sonnet and free verse.\u201d Despite Brown\u2019s relatively small poetic output,\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0critic Joseph McClellen believes this collection \u201cis enough to establish the poet as one of our best.\u201d\nAfter high school, Brown won a scholarship to the predominantly white, ivy league institution, Williams College. There he first began writing poetry. While other young poets his age were imitating T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and other high Modernists, Brown was not impressed with their \u201cpuzzle poetry.\u201d Instead, he turned for his models to the narrative versifiers, poets such as Edward Arlington Robinson, who captured the tragic drama of ordinary lives, and Robert Frost, who used terse vernacular that sounded like real people talking. At Williams, Brown studied literature with George Dutton, a critical realist who would exert a lasting influence. \u201cDutton was teaching Joseph Conrad,\u201d Brown recalled, as reported in the\u00a0New Republic.\u00a0\u201dHe said Joseph Conrad was being lionized in England ... [but] Conrad was sitting over in the corner, quiet, not participating. Dutton said he was brooding and probably thinking about his native Poland and the plight of his people. He looked straight at me. I don\u2019t know what he meant, but I think he meant, and this is symbolic to me, I think he meant don\u2019t get fooled by any lionizing, don\u2019t get fooled by being here at Williams with a selective clientele. There is business out there that you have to take care of. Your people, too, are in a plight. I\u2019ve never forgotten it.\u201d\nBrown came to believe that one way to help his people was through his writing. \u201cWhen Carl Sandburg said \u2018yes\u2019 to the American people, I wanted to say \u2018yes\u2019 to my people,\u201d Brown recalled in\u00a0New Directions: The Howard University Magazine.\u00a0In 1923, after earning his BA and MA from Harvard University, Brown embarked on a series of teaching jobs that would help him determine what form that \u201cyes\u201d should assume. He moved south and began to teach among the common people. As an instructor, he gained a reputation as a \u201cred ink man,\u201d because he covered his students' papers with corrections. But as a poet, he was learning important lessons from students about black Southern life. Attracted by his openness and easygoing manner, they invited him into their homes to hear worksongs, ballads, and the colorful tales of local lore. He met ex-coal-miner Calvin \u201cBig Boy\u201d Davis, who became the inspiration for Brown\u2019s \u201cOdyssey of Big Boy\u201d and \u201cLong Gone,\u201d as well as singer Luke Johnson, whom he paid a quarter for each song Luke wrote down. As Brown began to amass his own folklore collection, \u201che realized that worksongs, ballads, blues, and spirituals were, at their best, poetical expressions of Afro-American life,\u201d writes Robert O\u2019Meally in the\u00a0New Republic.\u00a0\u201dAnd he became increasingly aware of black language as often ironic, understated and double-edged.\u201d\nIn 1929, the same year his father died, Brown returned to Howard University, where he would remain for the rest of his career. Three years later, Harcourt, Brace published\u00a0Southern Road,\u00a0a first book of poems, drawn primarily from material he had gathered during his travels south. The book was heralded as a breakthrough for black poetry. Editor and critic Alain Locke, one of the chief proponents of what was then called the New Negro Movement (known now as the Harlem Renaissance), acknowledged the importance of the work in an essay collected in\u00a0Negro Anthology.\u00a0After explaining that the primary objective of Negro poetry should be \u201cthe poetic portrayal of Negro folk-life ... true in both letter and spirit to the idiom of the folk\u2019s own way of feeling and thinking,\u201d he declared that with the appearance of\u00a0Southern Road,\u00a0it could be said \u201cthat here for the first time is that much-desired and long-awaited acme attained or brought within actual reach.\u201d\nThe success of\u00a0Southern Road\u00a0did not insure Brown\u2019s future as a publishing poet. Not only did Harcourt, Brace reject\u00a0No Hiding Place\u00a0when Brown submitted the manuscript a few years later, they also declined to issue a second printing of\u00a0Southern Road,\u00a0because they did not think it would be profitable. These decisions had a devastating impact upon Brown\u2019s poetic reputation. Because no new poems appeared, many of his admirers assumed he had stopped writing. \u201cThat assumption,\u201d writes Sterling Stuckey in his introduction to\u00a0Collected Poems,\u00a0\u201dtogether with sadly deficient criticism from some quarters, helped to fix his place in time-as a not very important poet of the past.\u201d\nDiscouraged over the reception of his poems, Brown shifted his energies to other arenas; he continued teaching, but also produced a steady stream of book reviews, essays, and sketches about black life. He argued critically for many of the same goals he had pursued in verse: recognition of a black aesthetic, accurate depiction of the black experience, and the development of a literature worthy of his people\u2019s past. One of his most influential forums for dissemination of his ideas was a regular column he wrote for\u00a0Opportunity\u00a0magazine. There \u201cBrown argued for realism as a mode in literature and against such romantic interpretations of the South as the ones presented in\u00a0I'll Take My Stand\u00a0(1930), the manifesto of Southern agrarianism produced by contributors to the\u00a0Fugitive,\u00a0including John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate, and Robert Penn Warren,\u201d writes R.V. Burnette. \u201cAlthough he praised the efforts of white writers like Howard Odum (\u2018he is a poetic craftsman as well as a social observer\u2019), he was relentless in his criticism of popular works that distorted black life and character.\u201d\nBrown did not limit his writing to periodicals, but also produced several major books on Afro-American studies. His 1938 book,\u00a0Negro Poetry and Drama\u00a0and\u00a0The Negro in American Fiction,\u00a0include his seminal studies of black literary history. The former shows the growth of black artists within the context of American literature and delineates a black aesthetic; the latter examines what had been written about the black man in American fiction since his first appearance in obscure novels of the 1700s. A pioneering work that depicts how the prejudice facing blacks in real life is duplicated in their stereotyped treatment in literature,\u00a0The Negro in American Fiction\u00a0differs \u201cfrom the usual academic survey by giving a penetrating analysis of the social factors and attitudes behind the various schools and periods considered,\u201d Alain Locke believes.\nIn 1941, Brown and two colleagues Arthur P. Davis and Ulysses S. Lee edited\u00a0The Negro Caravan,\u00a0a book that \u201cdefined the field of Afro-American literature as a scholarly and academic discipline,\u201d according to\u00a0Ebony.\u00a0In this anthology, Brown demonstrates how black writers have been influenced by the same literary currents that have shaped the consciousness of all American writers\u2014\u201cpuritan didacticism, sentimental humanitarianism, local color, regionalism, realism, naturalism, and experimentalism\u201d\u2014and thus are not exclusively bound by strictures of race. The work has timeless merit, according to Julius Lester, who writes in the introduction to the 1970 revised edition that \u201cit comes as close today as it did in 1941 to being the most important single volume of black writing ever published.\u201d\n\r\nBrown received honorary doctorates from many schools, including Howard University, Northwestern University, Williams College, Boston University, Brown University, Harvard University, Yale University, University of Maryland, and the University of Pennsylvania. He was awarded the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize in 1982 for\u00a0The Collected Poems of\u00a0Sterling A.\u00a0Brown, and in 1984 he was named poet laureate of the District of Columbia.\nBrown died in 1989 in Tacoma Park, Maryland.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"], "School/Period:": ["Harlem Renaissance"]}}
