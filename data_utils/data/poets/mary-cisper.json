Her first collection, Dark Tussock Moth (2017), won the 2016 Trio House Prize. About the book, Bhisham Bherwani notes: \u201cher landslip lines stir up the matter of our rich heritage as man and nature, in perennial flux, negotiate a precarious equilibrium. Cisper\u2019s collection, invoking naturalist Maria Sibylla Merian, responds with sensitivity and wit to our ecology and our transitory lives.\u201d\u00a0\nCisper\u2019s work has been published in various journals, including Denver Quarterly, Water-Stone Review, Lana Turner, Terrain, and ZYZZYVA. In an interview for Newfound, Cisper commented about beginning a poem: \u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen, but I\u2019m curious (a kind of hopefulness?) for discovery\u2014however private\u2014keeping in mind what Jack Spicer said, \u2018\u2026 I always am very unhappy when I say what I want to say.\u2019\u201d\nCisper lives north of Santa Fe, New Mexico, with her husband.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
