She was a major female poet during her lifetime, whose work spanned genres and addressed a variety of subjects. She authored religious verse and love lyrics, as well as fables, pastorals, verse plays, odes, songs, and occasional poems. Her diverse and considerable body of work records her private thoughts and personal struggles, and also illustrates her awareness of the social and political climate of her era. Not only do Finch\u2019s poems reveal a sensitive mind and a religious soul, but they exhibit great generic range and demonstrate her fluent use of Augustan diction and forms.\n\r\nDescended from an ancient Hampshire family, Finch was born in April 1661, the third and youngest child of Anne Haselwood and Sir William Kingsmill. At the age of 21, Finch was appointed one of six maids of honor to Mary of Modena, wife of the Duke of York, in the court of Charles II. Her interest in verse writing began during this period and was probably encouraged by her friendships with Sarah Churchill and Anne Killigrew, also maids of honor and women of literary interests. It was during her residence in the court of Charles II that she met Colonel Heneage Finch, uncle of the fifth earl of Winchilsea and gentleman to the Duke of York. Finch fell in love with Anne and courted her persistently until they married. She resigned her post, although Heneage Finch continued to serve in various government positions. Their marriage was a happy one, as attested by his letters and several of her early poems. They led a quiet life, residing first in Westminster and then in London, as Heneage Finch became more involved in public affairs with the accession of James II in 1685. The couple wholly supported James throughout his brief and difficult reign and remained forever sympathetic to the interests of the Stuart court.\n\r\nFollowing the revolution and deposition of James in 1689, Finch lost his government position and permanently severed himself from public life by refusing allegiance to the incoming monarchs, William and Mary. The subsequent loss of income forced the Finches to take temporary refuge with various friends in London until Heneage\u2019s nephew Charles invited them to settle permanently on the family\u2019s estate in Eastwell in 1689 or 1690, where they resided for more than 25 years. It was during the happy yet trying years of her early married life that Anne Finch began to pursue more seriously her interest in writing poetry. She adopted the pseudonym Ardelia, and not surprisingly, many of her earliest poems are dedicated to her \u201cmuch lov\u2019d husband,\u201d who appears as \u201cDafnis\u201d in her work. Finch\u2019s poetry to her husband connects passionate love and poetry in subtle ways. In \u201cA Letter to the Same Person,\u201d she makes explicit the intertwined nature of love and verse, insisting that one is dependent on the other:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Love without Poetry\u2019s refining Aid\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Is a dull Bargain, and but coarsely made;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nor e\u2019er cou\u2019d Poetry successful prove,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Or touch the Soul, but when the Sense was Love.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oh! Cou\u2019d they both in Absence now impart\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Skill to my Hand, but to describe my Heart;\nFinch\u2019s early poems to her husband demonstrate her awareness of the guiding poetic conventions of the day, yet also point to the problems such conventions pose to the expression of intimate thought. In \u201cTo Mr F Now Earl of Winchilsea,\u201d for example, she appropriately invokes the Muses for inspiration, only to reject such external sources in favor of her own emotion.\nIn addition to celebrating her love, Finch\u2019s earliest verse also records her own frustration and sense of loss following her departure from court in 1689. She and her husband remained loyal to the Catholic Stuarts, a tenuous stance to assume given the popularity of the Protestant William and Mary in Britain in the 1690s. Finch\u2019s most explicit recognition of the problem of succession and of the difficulty of her relationship to the Stuarts appears in her first published poem, an elegy for James II anonymously published in 1701 and titled Upon the Death of King James the Second. Writing the elegy herself, since \u201cabler Writers\u201d refuse to honor the unpopular James, Finch calls to those loyal to James to \u201clet your Tears a heavier Tribute pay,\u201d and acknowledges the problem of succession, since James was robbed of the throne by his daughter and her foreign husband, although it was his \u201cright by birth.\u201d The poem ends with an appeal to Britain\u2019s \u201cMaternal Bosome\u201d\u2014an attack on William and possibly on the currently reigning queen as well\u2014to honor \u201cRightful Kings\u201d and \u201cAll who shall intend thy Good.\u201d Curiously, the speaker retreats in the final lines as one \u201cdevoted only to the Pen\u201d who \u201ccraves\u201d for \u201ca safe Retreat amidst thee\u2026/ Below th\u2019 ambitious World and just above my Grave.\u201d Here, Finch\u2019s benign acceptance of her exile from court may reflect the comfort of her retirement in Eastwell. Yet the reversal of the bitter start attests to the poem\u2019s politically unpopular and even dangerous attitude and to Finch\u2019s own inability to speak very openly of her loyalty to the Stuart court. Although her sense of loss seemed to dissipate after the turn of the century as she became more comfortable with her husband\u2019s family in Eastwell, Finch never forgot her happy days at court, or the devastation she felt after 1689. Even as late as 1717, in \u201cA Supplication for the joys of Heaven,\u201d Finch refers to her deep sense of loss following the revolution and her subsequent turn to God and Heaven for comfort.\nAs her work developed more fully during her retirement at Eastwell, Finch demonstrated an increasing awareness of the poetic traditions of her own period as well as those governing older verse. Her work\u2019s affinity with the metaphysical tradition is evident in poems such as \u201cThe Petition for an Absolute Retreat,\u201d which represents the distanced perspective of the speaker through the image of the telescope, an emblem common to much religious poetry of the 17th century. Finch experimented with rhyme and meter and imitated several popular genres, including occasional poems, satirical verse, and religious meditations, but fables comprise the largest portion of her oeuvre. Most likely inspired by the popularity of the genre at the turn of the century, Finch wrote dozens of these often satiric vignettes between 1700 and 1713. Most of them were modeled after the short tales of Jean La Fontaine, the French fable writer made popular by Charles II. Finch mocked these playful trifles, and her fables offer interesting bits of social criticism in the satiric spirit of her age.\n\r\nHowever, Finch\u2019s more serious poems have received greater critical attention than her fables. \u201cA Nocturnal Reverie,\u201d for instance, is clearly Augustan in its perspective and technique, although many admirers have tended to praise the poem as pre-Romantic: William Wordsworth mentioned its \u201cnew images of external nature\u201d in his \u201cEssay, Supplementary to the Preface\u201d collected in his Poems,\u00a0first published in 1815. Finch\u2019s poem opens with classical references and proceeds through characteristically Augustan descriptions of the foxglove, the cowslip, the glowworm, and the moon. Finch imitates Augustan preferences for decorum and balance in her use of heroic couplets and the medial caesura in setting the peaceful, nocturnal atmosphere of the poem:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Or from some Tree, fam\u2019d for the Owl\u2019s delight,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She, hollowing clear, directs the Wand\u2019rer right:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In such a Night, when passing Clouds give place,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Or thinly vail the Heav\u2019ns mysterious Face;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Odours, which declin\u2019d repelling Day,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thro temp\u2019rate Air uninterrupted stray;\nWhile Finch\u2019s verse occasionally displays slight antitheses of idea and some structural balances of line and phrase, she never attains the epigrammatic couplet form that Alexander Pope perfected in the early 18th century. Her admission in \u201cA Nocturnal Reverie\u201d that her verse attempts \u201cSomething, too high for Syllables to speak\u201d might be linked to the Romantic recognition of the discrepancy between human aspiration and achievement. But ultimately she retreats to God and solitude and displays a more properly Augustan attitude in the acceptance of her human limitations. At times her descriptions of natural detail bear some likeness to poets such as James Thomson, but Finch\u2019s expression is more immediate and simple, and her versification ultimately exhibits an Augustan rather than a pre-Romantic sensibility.\n\r\nAnother form Finch appropriates is the Pindaric ode. Between 1694 and 1703 she wrote three such odes in the form introduced in England by Abraham Cowley in the 1650s, following his preference for complex and irregular stanzaic structures and rhyme schemes. These poems\u2014\u201dAll is Vanity,\u201d The Spleen (1709), and \u201cOn the Hurricane\u201d\u2014all depict metaphysical entities working against humanity to test its strength and faith in God. The Spleen, possibly Finch\u2019s most well-known poem, was first published anonymously in 1709. The ode was immediately popular and received much attention for its accurate description of the symptoms of melancholia\u2014the disease often associated with the spleen\u2014which Finch suffered from throughout her life. The speaker begins by acknowledging that hypochondria is also often associated with the spleen, the \u201cpretended Fits,\u201d the \u201csullen Husband\u2019s feign\u2019d Excuse,\u201d and the coquette\u2019s melancholy pose, \u201ccareless Posture, and the Head reclin\u2019d.\u201d She then proceeds to undermine these portraits of feigned illness, treating the disease as a real and terrifying affliction:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From Speech restrain\u2019d, by thy Deceits abus\u2019d,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To Deserts banish\u2019d or in Cells reclus\u2019d,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mistaken Vot\u2019ries to the Pow\u2019rs Divine,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wilst they a purer Sacrifice design,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do but the Spleen obey, and worship at thy Shrine.\nIn \u201cArdelia to Melancholy\u201d Finch similarly presents a struggle against melancholy and depression, casting the disease as an \u201cinveterate foe\u201d and \u201cTyrant pow\u2019r\u201d from which \u201cheav\u2019n alone\u201d can set her \u201cfree.\u201d The poem shifts from the first to the third person, generalizing Ardelia\u2019s particular experience to encompass all those who suffer from melancholia: \u201cAll, that cou\u2019d ere thy ill got rule, invade, / Their uselesse arms, before thy feet have laid; / The Fort is thine, now ruin\u2019d, all within, / Whilst by decays without, thy Conquest too, is seen.\u201d The imperial language of the poem might also suggest a more abstract relation between her submission to the spleen and her status as a political exile.\nFinch circulated two manuscripts of her work before she published Miscellany Poems, and several of her poems were published individually in broadsheets and smaller collections. Finch experienced some additional, though limited, recognition after the publication of her Miscellany Poems. Richard Steele, for instance, published several of her poems in his Miscellanies of 1714. She was personally acquainted with both Swift and Pope, though the full extent of her relationships with them is unknown. Finch is mentioned in several compilations, memoirs, and literary dictionaries during the 18th century, to a lesser extent in the 19th century, and began receiving sustained attention in the late 20th century. The first modern edition of her work, though incomplete, appeared in 1903. Much of the recent interest in Finch arises from current academic efforts to recover the work of previously neglected women writers, exploring how those writers depict themselves as poetic subjects and examining the ways in which they adopt and alter the poetic standards of a particular period. In addition to her representations of melancholy and the spleen\u2014an affliction commonly ascribed to women of her time\u2014Finch also called attention to the need for the education of women and recorded the isolation and solitude that marked women\u2019s lives. In \u201cThe Bird and the Arras,\u201d for instance, a female bird enclosed in a room mistakes the arras for a real scene and flies happily into it. But she is soon trapped, \u201cFlutt\u2019ring in endless circles of dismay\u201d until she finally escapes to \u201cample space,\u201d the \u201conly Heav\u2019n of Birds.\u201d Such images of entrapment and frustration are echoed in Finch\u2019s description of the limitations of women\u2019s social roles in England at the turn of the 18th century. In \u201cThe Unequal Fetters,\u201d the speaker notes her fear of fading youth, but later refuses to be a \u201cpris\u2019ner\u201d in marriage. Finch admits that marriage does \u201cslightly tye Men,\u201d yet insists that women remain \u201cclose Pris\u2019ners\u201d in the union, while men can continue to function \u201cAt the full length of all their chain.\u201d For the most part, however, Finch\u2019s message is subtle in its persistent decorum and final resignation and consolation in God. Although she was certainly aware of the problems many of her countrywomen faced, and particularly of the difficulties confronting women writers, Finch offers a playful yet firm protest rather than an outspoken condemnation of the social position of women. And although she endured a loss of affluence with James\u2019s deposition, there is little evidence that she abhorred her 25-year retirement in Eastwell, which afforded her the leisure in which to pursue her creative interests.\n\r\nFinch died quietly on August 5, 1720 after several years of increasingly ill health. Following her funeral, Heneage Finch praised her Christian virtues and persistent loyalty to her friends and family, and noting her talents as a writer: \u201cTo draw her...just character requires a masterly pen like her own. We shall only presume to say she was the most faithful servant to her Royall Mistresse, the best wife to her noble Lord, and in every other relation public and private so illustrious an example of all moral and divine virtues.\u201d Much of the immediate appeal of Finch\u2019s verse to a post-Romantic modern audience lies in the sincerity with which she expressed the Christian values her husband recalls in his eulogy. But clearly Anne Finch belongs to her age and merits greater appreciation for her poetic experimentation and her fluent use of Augustan diction and forms. Her voice is clear and self-assured, evidence of the controlled and confident poise of an aristocratic poet.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Augustan"]}}
