Fintan O\u2019Toole wrote of Clifton\u2019s work in the Irish Times: \u201cHis is a universe of aftermaths, hauntings and returns, in which even God . . . dreams of becoming flesh again,\u201d and asserted that Secular Eden \u201ccaptures an Irish voice that is utterly contemporary in its restless movement through time and space.\u201d\nClifton has lived in Europe, Africa, and Asia, working as an aid administrator in Thailand from 1980 to 1988. Clifton\u2019s On the Spine of Italy: A Year in the Abruzzi (1999) is a prose work based on a year he spent in the Abruzzi mountains of Italy with his wife, the writer Deirdre Madden.
