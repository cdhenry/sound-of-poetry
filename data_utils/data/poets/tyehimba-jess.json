A reviewer for Publishers Weekly\u00a0noted that \u201cthe collection\u2019s strength lies in its contradictory forms; from biography to lyric to hard-driving prose poem, boast to song, all are soaked in the rhythm and dialect of Southern blues and the demands of honoring one\u2019s talent.\" Jess's second book\u00a0Olio (2016) received the Pulitzer Prize.\nA two-time member of the Chicago Green Mill Slam team, Jess was also Chicago\u2019s Poetry Ambassador to Accra, Ghana.
