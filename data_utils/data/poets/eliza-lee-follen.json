They had one son together.\nThe Follens were early anti-slavery activists. Charles was the first German professor at Harvard, though his career there was cut short, possibly due to his abolitionist work.\nFollen is the author of The Skeptic (1835), Sketches of Married Life (1838), and several works for children. Her children\u2019s verse is noted for including nonsense and nursery rhyme while avoiding the more violent imagery common at the time. In addition to her own work, which explores political and religious themes, Follen\u2019s Poems (1839) includes her translation of a selection of German poetry. She edited two Sunday school periodicals, The Christian Teachers Manual from 1828 to 1830, and The Child\u2019s Friend from 1843 to 1850. Follen also edited the first American edition of Grimm\u2019s fairy tales, Gammer Grethel (1840). She published the political writings of her husband and of Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon, a 17th-century French liberal theorist.After her husband\u2019s death at sea in 1840, Follen increasingly devoted herself to activism and publishing. She died in Brookline, Massachusetts.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
