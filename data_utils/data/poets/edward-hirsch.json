Over the course of many collections of poetry and criticism, and the long-running \u201cPoet\u2019s Choice\u201d column in the Washington Post, Hirsch has transformed the quotidian into poetry in his own work, as well as demonstrated his adeptness at explicating the nuances and shades of feeling, tradition, and craft at work in the poetry of others. Introducing Hirsch at the National Arts Club, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jhumpa Lahiri remarked: \u201cThe trademarks of his poems are things I strive to bring to my own writing: to be intimate but restrained, to be tender without being sentimental, to witness life without flinching, and above all, to isolate and preserve those details of our existence so often overlooked, so easily forgotten, so essential to our souls.\u201d \u201cI would like to speak in my poems with what the Romantic poets called \u2018the true voice of feeling,\u2019\u201d Hirsch told Contemporary Authors. \u201cI believe, as Ezra Pound once said, that when it comes to poetry, \u2018only emotion endures.\u2019\u201d\nDescribed by Peter Stitt in Poetry as \u201ca poet of genuine talent and feeling,\u201d Hirsch\u00a0was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award\u00a0for his first volume, For the Sleepwalkers (1981); his second, Wild Gratitude\u00a0(1986) won the award in 1987. He has been awarded fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, and received a MacArthur \u201cGenius Grant\u201d in 1997. His numerous other awards include an Ingram Merrill Foundation Award, the Rome Prize from the American Academy in Rome, and a Lila Wallace-Reader\u2019s Digest Writers\u2019 Award. A former professor at Wayne State University and the University of Houston, Hirsch is president of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation and is a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets.\nBorn in 1950 in Chicago, Hirsch was educated at Grinnell College and the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a PhD in folklore. His first books contain vignettes of urban life and numerous tributes to artists, which, according to David Wojahn in the New York Times Book Review, \u201cbegin as troubled meditations on human suffering [but] end in celebration.\u201d New Republic contributor Jay Parini wrote that in For the Sleepwalkers, \u201cHirsch inhabits, poem by poem, dozens of other skins. He can become Rimbaud, Rilke, Paul Klee, or Matisse, in each case convincingly.\u201d Hirsch uses other voices in later works like On Love (1998). Taking on the personae of dozens of poets from the past, including diverse writers like D.H. Lawrence, Charles Baudelaire, and Jimi Hendrix, Hirsch creates an imaginary conversation between them as they discuss the subject of love.\nHirsch\u2019s interest in mining the past and traditions of poetry extends to his critical work as well. How to Read a Poem and Fall in Love with Poetry (1999) presents close-readings of an eclectic mix of poems and poets, written in an accessible style. The Demon and the Angel: Searching for the Source of Artistic Inspiration (2003) considers the concept of duende, which posits that artistic creation arises out of a heightened state, or power. Hirsch explores the implications of duende\u2014made most famous by\u00a0Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca\u2014across a variety of artists, including Martha Graham and Lorca himself. Hirsch\u2019s encyclopedic knowledge of poetry, poets, and poetics served him during his tenure at the Washington Post, where he penned the weekly \u201cPoet\u2019s Choice\u201d column. Collecting the columns into the book Poet\u2019s Choice (2006), Hirsch stated his goals for his work as a critic: \u201cI write for both initiated and uninitiated readers of poetry. I like to spread the word ... My notion was to make links and connections, to bring forward unknown poets, and to help people to think about poetry in a somewhat deeper way. It seemed to work.\u201d In 2014, Hirsch published A Poet\u2019s Glossary, a comprehensive look at poetry\u2019s\u00a0forms, devices, groups, movements, -isms, aesthetics, rhetorical terms, and folklore.\nHirsch\u2019s more recent volumes of poetry include Earthly Measures (1994), On Love (1998), and Lay Back the Darkness (2003), which includes treatments of the Orpheus myth as well as several ekphrasis poems. The Living Fire: New and Selected Poems 1972\u20132010 shows, according to Peter Campion in the New York Times, \u201ca kind of model for the growth of poetic intelligence.\u201d Campion went on to note, \u201cWhat makes Hirsch so singular in American poetry is the balance he strikes between the quotidian and something completely other\u2014an irrational counterforce.\u201d Though noting that Hirsch\u2019s poems sometimes sink to rhetoric, Campion concluded that, \u201cHirsch situates himself between the ordinary and the ecstatic. The everyday and the otherworldly temper each other in these excellent \u00adpoems, and American poetry gains new strength as a result.\u201d\nHirsch\u2019s poetry collection Gabriel (2014), which explores the death of his son, was longlisted for the National Book Award.\u00a0Eavan Boland\u00a0described\u00a0Gabriel\u00a0as \u201ca masterpiece of sorrow ... the creation of the loved and lost boy is one of the poem\u2019s most important effects.\u201d\nHirsch lives in Brooklyn.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
