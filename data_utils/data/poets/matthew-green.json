He is author of The Grotto, a Poem (1732), about Queen Caroline\u2019s Grotto in Richmond. He is best known for his aphorisms and The Spleen, an Epistle Inscribed to His Particular Friend Mr. C.J. (1737), a poem in octosyllabic meter that praises the simple, contemplative life.\nHis poetry was admired by Alexander Pope and Thomas Gray.
