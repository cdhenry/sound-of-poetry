With wry humor and formal curiosity, Ronk tests the limits of syntax and literary convention in her work. She is the\u00a0author of numerous collections of poetry, including Silences (2019),\u00a0Ocular Proof (2016);\u00a0Transfer of Qualities\u00a0(2013), a National Book Award long-list selection;\u00a0Partially Kept (2012);\u00a0Vertigo (2007), chosen by C.D. Wright for the National Poetry Series; and\u00a0In a landscape of having to repeat (2004), winner of the PEN Center USA Literary Award.\u00a0Ronk has stated that, for her, \u201cWriting is the most interesting and exhausting thing I do. And every time I read a great piece \u2026 I am eager to write more, to find yet another juxtaposition of words. Each one offers something of a solution to the mystery of how it is done.\u201d\nRonk\u2019s prose includes Glass Grapes: And Other Stories (2008), and\u00a0Displeasures of the Table: memoir as caricature (2001). Her work has been featured in American Hybrid: A Norton Anthology of New Poetry (2009) and Lyric Postmodernisms: An Anthology of Contemporary Innovative Poetries\u00a0(2008). Her additional honors include the PIP Gertrude Stein Award for Innovative Poetry and a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts.\nWith writers Paul Vangelisti and Dennis Phillips, Ronk founded the cooperative literary press Littoral Books. She coedited The New Review of Literature, which ceased publication in 2008. The Irma and Jay Price Professor of English Literature and a professor of comparative literary studies at Occidental College, Ronk has also taught at the Otis College of Art and Design. A selection of her papers is held at the University of California, San Diego\u2019s Mandeville Special Collections Library. She lives in Los Angeles, California.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
