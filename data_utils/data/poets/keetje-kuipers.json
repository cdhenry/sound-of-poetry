She earned her BA at Swarthmore College and her MFA at the University of Oregon. Her collections of poetry include Beautiful in the Mouth (2010), which won an A. Poulin Jr. Poetry Prize, The Keys to the Jail (2014), and All its Charms (2019). In her poems, Kuipers ranges over and across landscapes with \u201can unmistakable sense of adventure,\u201d in poet Eavan Boland\u2019s phrase. In an interview, Kuipers herself noted that \u201cgeography has become of primary importance to me, and the battle for belonging\u2014and the butting together of disparate and conflicting geographies that express different parts of myself\u2014are clearly hashed out in my poetry.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nKuipers\u2019s many honors and awards include fellowships from the Vermont Studio Center, the Squaw Valley Community of Writers, and Oregon Literary Arts. A former Wallace Stegner fellow at Stanford University, Kuipers has also been a Margery Davis Boyden Wilderness Writing Resident and an Emerging Writer Lecturer at Gettysburg College. She serves as a senior editor at Poetry Northwest and teaches on the faculty of the Hugo House in Seattle. She lives with her wife and daughter on an island in the Salish Sea.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
