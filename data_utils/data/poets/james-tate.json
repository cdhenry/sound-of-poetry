He earned a BA from\u00a0Kansas State College and an MFA from the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop.\u00a0He was the author of over 20 poetry collections, including the posthumously published The Government Lake (2018); The Ghost Soldiers\u00a0(2008);\u00a0Worshipful Company of Fletchers\u00a0(1994), which won the National Book Award;\u00a0Selected Poems\u00a0(1991), which won the Pulitzer Prize and the William Carlos Williams Award;\u00a0Distance from Loved Ones\u00a0(1990);\u00a0Constant Defender\u00a0(1983);\u00a0Viper Jazz\u00a0(1976); and\u00a0The Oblivion Ha-Ha\u00a0(1970).\n\r\nTate\u2019s poems have been described as tragic, comic, absurdist, ironic, hopeful, haunting, lonely, and surreal. Tate said of his own poems in a Paris Review interview,\u00a0\u201cThere is nothing better than [to move the reader deeply]. I love my funny poems, but I\u2019d rather break your heart. And if I can do both in the same poem, that\u2019s the best. If you laughed earlier in the poem, and I bring you close to tears in the end, that\u2019s the best.\u201d\n\r\nHis first major collection, The Lost Pilot (1967), was selected by Dudley Fitts for the Yale Series of Younger Poets when Tate was just 23 and still a graduate student. The title poem is dedicated to Tate\u2019s father, a B-17 copilot killed on a bombing mission during World War II when James was five months old. However, as poet and critic Dana Gioia noted in a 1998 essay, Tate\u2019s subsequent work \u201crevealed his dreams and nightmares, his fears and desires\u2014but he never shared further details of his waking life.\u201d Over the decades, Tate honed his distinctive writing style, in which, as poet Donald Revell describes it, \u201cThe tender phrase is subordinated by an absurdity. A crazily surreal passage is broken off and followed by a painfully simple realization of ordinary, unqualified grief.\u201d\n\r\nMany of Tate\u2019s poems are character driven, featuring a narrator\u2019s various encounters with a gnome, a goat, an insurance agent. In a 1998 interview, he pointed to one unifying element in his work: \u201cMy characters usually are\u2014or, I\u2019d say most often, I don\u2019t want to generalize too much\u2014but most often they\u2019re in trouble, and they\u2019re trying to find some kind of life.\u201d Of Tate\u2019s characters in The Ghost Soldiers, critic Richard Wirick writes, \u201cThey are stick people but their language\u2014fleetingly glimpsed\u2014gives them the fullness of crushed spirits, Nietschean sheep, Republican wives.\u201d\n\r\nTate\u2019s honors included an Academy of American Poets chancellorship, a National Institute of Arts and Letters Award for Poetry, the Wallace Stevens Award,\u00a0the Tanning Prize,\u00a0and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. He taught the\u00a0University of California at Berkeley, Columbia University, Emerson College, and for five decades,\u00a0at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. He died in 2015.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
