Unable to afford university, Gay went to London to apprentice as a draper instead. While in London, he began writing journalism, including the pamphlet The Present State of Wit (1711), a survey of contemporary periodicals and authors. Rural Sports (1713) is generally considered his first important poem; the poem is ostensibly pastoral, but the speaker discovers that predatory instincts undergird much of nature. By 1714, Gay had started corresponding with Alexander Pope and become a member of the Scriblerus Club, a group that included Jonathan Swift, John Arbuthnot, Thomas Parnell, and Lord Oxford. Gay\u2019s publications dating from this time include the poems Trivia: Or, the Art of Walking the Streets of London (1716) and The Shepherd\u2019s Week (1714). The Scriblerus Club influenced Gay\u2019s major plays of this period, The What D\u2019Ye Call It (1715) and Three Hours After Marriage (1717), which was frequently linked to Pope. \u00a0 Gay was more or less dependent on patronage his whole life and lived in various semi-employed states with a number of aristocrats. Many works, such as the Fables (1727, 1738), were written to win the favor of specific members of court. Though relying on the generosity of patrons such as the Duchess of Queensberry, Gay also earned money from his plays, especially The Beggar\u2019s Opera (1728), which enjoyed unprecedented success. Running for 62 performances, the opera inspired numerous imitations and parodies and provided the basis for Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht\u2019s 20th-century Threepenny Opera (1928). Allegedly satirizing then-prime minister Sir Robert Walpole, Gay\u2019s play gained notoriety and made staging its sequel, Polly, impossible until 1777. The Beggar\u2019s Opera was in some ways the culmination of Gay\u2019s career. In 1730, he moved to the Queensberry estate in Burlington Gardens, where he spent the last years of his life in partial isolation. He restaged an early effort, The Wife of Bath (1713, revised 1730), and continued writing plays, though he didn\u2019t attempt to get them produced. After his sudden death from fever, he was buried in Westminster Abbey. Pope was a pallbearer and contributed an epitaph to Gay\u2019s memorial. Above it are Gay\u2019s own words: \u201cLife is a jest; and all things show it / I thought so once; but now I know it.\u201d\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Augustan"]}}
