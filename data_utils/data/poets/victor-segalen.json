He traveled to Tahiti, where he held a medical post (1903\u20131904), and to China several times as a member of several archaeological expeditions. He is the author of a collection of prose poems, St\u00e8les (1912); the novels Les Imm\u00e9moriaux and Ren\u00e9 Leys (1922); and Equip\u00e9e (1929), an account of an imaginary expedition.\nHis books often portray the effects of colonization and European culture on colonized populations. His theories of the exotic are pursued in Essay on Exoticism: An Aesthetics of Diversity (2002, trans. Ya\u00ebl Rachel Schlick). St\u00e8les\u2014available in a 2007 English translation by Timothy Billings and Christopher Bush\u2014is a collection of poems that imitate the inscriptions of stelae that he observed on his travels in China.\nIn 1919 Segalen was found dead in a forest in near Brest, with a copy of Shakespeare\u2019s works open to Hamlet at his side.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"]}}
