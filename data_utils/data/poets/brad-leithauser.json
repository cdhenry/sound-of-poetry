Leithauser explained in an interview with PBS, \u201cAs a poet, I\u2019m very interested in structures and what you might call the mathematics of poetry, the prosody of poetry, the stuff that is as independent of meaning as anything in a poem can be independent of meaning.\u201d Critic Joel Conarroe, in a review of Hundreds of Fireflies, described Leithauser as \u201cinventive by nature, playful, and in love with language.\u201d\nFor 21 years, he shared the position of Emily Dickinson Senior Lecturer in the Humanities at Mount Holyoke College with his wife, the poet Mary Jo Salter. In 2008, he joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins University, where he is Chair of the MA in Teaching Writing Program, the MA in Writing Program, and the Science Writing Program in the Advanced Academic Programs.
