His photo was featured in Esquire, Vogue, and Glamour, and his book was often stolen from the library. A Guggenheim Fellowship enabled him to go to Europe; he spent much of the ensuing two decades living modestly abroad. Although the literary world embraced him early in his career, he was something of a self-imposed exile: flunking out of high school; congregating with Allen Ginsberg and Jack Spicer in San Francisco but never really writing like a Beat poet; living in Europe and writing American poetry inspired by Pound and Eliot.  A self-described \u201cserious romantic,\u201d Gilbert had a relationship with poet Linda Gregg, and was later married to sculptor Michiko Nogami, who died after 11 years of marriage. Many of his poems are about these relationships and losses. Gilbert\u2019s fourth book, Refusing Heaven (2005), contains, as poet Dan Albergotti describes, \u201cpoems about love, loss, and grief that defy all expectations of sentimentality. All of them are part of the larger poem, the poem that is the life of the poet, perhaps the most profound and moving piece of work to come out of American literature in generations.\u201d  Refusing Heaven won the National Book Critics Circle Award, and Gilbert\u2019s work has also received a Lannan Literary Award for Poetry and a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. His second book of poetry, Monolithos (1982), won the Stanley Kunitz Prize and the American Poetry Review Prize. Despite these awards, some critics have ignored or dismissed Gilbert, and critic Meghan O\u2019Rourke, writing for Slate in 2005, pondered why: \u201cGilbert isn\u2019t just a remarkable poet. He\u2019s a poet whose directness and lucidity ought to appeal to lots of readers . . . the poet who stands outside his own time, practicing a poetics of purity in an ever-more cacophonous world\u2014a lyrical ghost, you might say, from a literary history that never came to be.\u201d  In an essay he wrote to introduce his own work in the anthology New American Poets of the Golden Gate (1984), Gilbert pointed to the spareness of his work: \u201cI am by nature drawn to exigence, compression, selection,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOne of the special pleasures in poetry for me is accomplishing a lot with the least means possible.\u201d Publishing only four books since he began writing over 50 years ago reinforces for his readers Gilbert\u2019s love of economy. In a 2006 interview on NPR, he reflected on his relatively sparse list of publications: \u201cIt\u2019s not a business with me . . . . I\u2019m not a professional of poetry, I\u2019m a farmer of poetry.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
