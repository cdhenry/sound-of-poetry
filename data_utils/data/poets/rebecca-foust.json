She earned a JD from Stanford Law School and was a practicing attorney for many years before returning, at age 50, to poetry. She went on to earn her MFA from Warren Wilson College. She is the author of four books of poetry:\u00a0Paradise Drive\u00a0(2015), which won a Poetry Society of Virginia Book Award, a National Indie Excellence Award for Poetry, a San Francisco Book Festival Award for Poetry, and a Royal Dragonfly Award for Poetry;\u00a0All That Gorgeous Pitiless Song\u00a0(2010), winner of a Many Mountains Moving Press Book Prize; and\u00a0God, Seed: Poetry & Art About the Natural World\u00a0(2010), a collaboration with artist Lorna Stevens that won a\u00a0Foreword Reviews\u00a0Book of the Year Award for Poetry. Foust\u2019s chapbooks include\u00a0Mom\u2019s Canoe\u00a0(2009) and\u00a0Dark Card\u00a0(2008). In her poetry, she blends narrative and song, layering images and story through free verse and, as in\u00a0Paradise Drive,\u00a0received forms such as the sonnet. \u201cThe sonnets of this new life are jagged, fresh, and formed in only the way a stunningly skilled poet can craft them,\u201d noted\u00a0Molly Peacock\u00a0of the book. \u201cFoust drives her Keatsian sensibility straight into the 21st Century of terrorism and autism, divorce and yoga, soldiers and syringes, booze and valet parking, determined to prove that truth makes beauty.\u201d\nFoust has held residencies at the MacDowell Colony and the Frost Place, where she was the 2014 Dartmouth poet-in-residence. She is on the board of the Marin Poetry Center, a reader for the Northern California Book Award, and assistant editor of fiction for\u00a0Narrative\u00a0magazine. An autism activist and a grassroots organizer, Foust lives in the Bay Area.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
