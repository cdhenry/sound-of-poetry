Di Piero was born in 1945 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and earned his BA from St. Joseph\u2019s College and MA from San Francisco State College. A poet, essayist, art critic, and translator, Di Piero has taught at institutions such as Northwestern University, Louisiana State University, and Stanford, where he is professor emeritus of English and on faculty in the prestigious Stegner Poetry Workshop. Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001, Di Piero was awarded the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize in 2012.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDi Piero\u2019s poetry is known for its gritty realism. Populated with characters and settings reminiscent of the South Philadelphia neighborhood of his boyhood and the Italian-American working-class families he grew up with, Di Piero\u2019s poetry frequently makes use of colloquial language and diction\u2014what poet Philip Levine described as \u201cour American voices in all their glory and banality.\u201d Using everyday objects as well as speech to create both rhythm and image, Di Piero\u2019s style is\u00a0able to evoke \u201cintensity and \u2026 atmosphere within the space of a single line,\u201d\u00a0according to\u00a0Publisher\u2019s Weekly. Di Piero\u2019s numerous collections of poetry include The First Hour (1982), The Dog Star (1990), Skirts and Slacks (2001), Chinese Apples: New and Selected Poems (2007), and Nitro Nights (2011), and TOMBO (2014). Of his own work, Di Piero told McSweeney\u2019s magazine in an interview: \u201cI don\u2019t think about differentiations. My work, for me, is all a weird, present streaming. I\u2019m guided (or driven) by emotion and sounds, so I\u2019m usually not aware of what kinds of poems I\u2019ve written until they\u2019re already written and I see the pattern of the obsession \u2026 All my life I\u2019ve wanted to write less intensely, to relax, take it easy, lighten up for Christ\u2019s sake, be clear and plain and funny and loose and whimsical. I\u2019m probably still not quite there.\u201d\nDi Piero also takes inspiration from works of art, including the art of Italian masters such as Caravaggio, Carpaccio, and Fra Lippo Lippi as well as German expressionist painter Paul Klee, whose sketch \u201cRuined Architectures\u201d is the frontispiece to TOMBO. Di Piero\u2019s interest in visual art has led him to art criticism, and he is a regular art reviewer for the San Diego Reader. Di Piero has published a number of volumes of essays on literary and visual art, including Memory and Enthusiasm (1989), Out of Eden: Essays on Modern Art (1991), Shooting the Works: On Poetry and Pictures (1996), a collection of memoirs, essays, notes, and art criticism, City Dog (2009), and When Can I See You Again: New Art Writings (2010).\nAn award-winning translator of Italian poetry, Di Piero\u2019s first published translation was\u00a0Giacomo Leopardi\u2019s Pensieri (1981). Other translations include Sandro Penna\u2019s This Strange Joy (1982), which received the Academy of American Poets Raiziss/de Palchi Translation Award, Leonardo Sinisgalli\u2019s The Ellipse (1982) and Night of Shooting Stars (2011), and a translation of Euripides\u2019s Ion (1996). Speaking to John Rodden about translation, Di Piero noted: \u201cTranslation assists you in arriving at recognitions. As a translator, you feel your way through to some of the same recognitions that the poet originally had and that shaped the poem. For me, this sense of pursuing recognitions\u2014of waiting for recognitions to arrive\u2014is what poetry and translation are about. So the process of translation has helped me immensely in that way: not as a question of language, but rather as a quest for recognitions.\u201d\nW.S. Di Piero has won numerous honors and awards for his work, including fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Ingram Merrill Foundation, and the Lila Wallace-Reader\u2019s Digest Fund. He lives in San Francisco.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
