She was influenced by Langston Hughes, who was an early supporter of her writing. In her short-lined poems, grounded in personal narratives, Evans explored the nature of community and the power of language to name and reframe. Her best-known poems include \u201cSpeak the Truth to the People,\u201d \u201cTo Be Born Black,\u201d and \u201cI Am a Black Woman.\u201d\nEvans\u2019s poetry collections include Continuum: New and Selected Poems (2007, revised and expanded in 2015); A Dark and Splendid Mass (1992); Nightstar: 1973\u20131978 (1981); I Am a Black Woman (1970), which won the Black Academy of Arts and Letters poetry award; and Where Is All the Music? (1968). Evans\u00a0also published\u00a0the essay collection Clarity as Concept: A Poet\u2019s Perspective (2006).\nIn her essay \u201cHow We Speak,\u201d published in Clarity as Concept, Evans wrote, \u201cListening is a special art. It is a fine art developed by practice. One hears the unexpressed as clearly as if it had been verbalized. One hears silence screaming in clarion tones. Ninety decibels. Hears tears, unshed, falling. Hears hunger gnawing at the back of spines; hears aching feet pushed past that one more step. Hears the repressed hurt of incest, hears the anguish of spousal abuse. Hears it all. Clearly, listening is a fine art. It can translate an obscure text into reality that walks, weeps and carries its own odor. Listening can decode a stranger\u2019s eye and hear autobiography. Listening can watch a listless babe and understand the absence of future, the improbability, in fact, of possibility. Listening, more often than not, is a crushing experience.\u201d\nEvans\u2019s books for younger audiences include I\u2019m Late: The Story of LaNeese and Moonlight and Alisha Who Didn\u2019t Have Anyone of Her Own (2006); Dear Corinne, Tell Somebody! Love, Annie: A Book About Secrets (1999); Singing Black: Alternative Nursery Rhymes for Children (1998, illustrated by Ramon Price); Jim Flying High (1979, illustrated by Ashley Bryan); and J.D. (1973, illustrated by Jerry Pinkney).\nEvans\u2019s plays include Boochie (1979), Portrait of a Man (1979), River of My Song (1977), and the musicals New World (1984) and Eye (1979, an adaptation of Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s Their Eyes Were Watching God).\nEvans\u2019s critical works include Black Women Writers (1950\u20131980): A Critical Evaluation (1984) and Black Women Writers: Arguments and Interviews (1983). Her work\u00a0featured in numerous anthologies, including Black Voices: An Anthology of Afro-American Literature (1968) and Black Out Loud: An Anthology of Modern Poems by Black Americans (1970).\nThe recipient of fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, MacDowell Colony, Yaddo, and the John Hay Whitney Foundation, Evans also received an honorary doctorate from Marian College and was featured on a Ugandan postage stamp. She taught at Spelman College, Purdue University, and Cornell University. Evans lived in Indianapolis for nearly 70 years, before her death in 2017.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"], "School/Period:": ["Black Arts Movement"]}}
