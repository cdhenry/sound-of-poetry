His poems have also been featured in Joyful Noise: An Anthology of American Spiritual Poetry (2006) and in Best American Poetry (2005). He uses juxtaposition to explore themes of transformation and transcendence and has described his poems as \u201cequal parts political, erotic, and meditations on the world.\u201d In an interview with G.E. Reutter, Gontarek continued, \u201cMy views on these things are complicated; hence the overlay texture of the poems.\u201d Reviewing D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu Diner, Amy Small-McKinney observed that \u201cLeonard Gontarek asks his readers to hear, see, and practically touch, as though in a state of synesthesia, the particulars of his world. His poems ask us to suspend our own worldviews, to trust him, and to give ourselves over to his meticulous use of language and startling juxtapositions of imagery.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nGontarek\u2019s honors include several Pushcart Prize nominations and two fellowships from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. He has edited several anthologies of children\u2019s poetry, including This Is Forever the Room (1979), The Balloonists Are Coming Back from the Clouds (1978), and Rain of the Haunted Trees (1979). He lives in Philadelphia, where he\u00a0coordinates Peace/Works: Poets and Writers for Peace and has taught through the Philadelphia Arts in Education Partnership and the Arts League.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
