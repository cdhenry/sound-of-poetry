In Poeta en San Francisco Reyes employs English, Spanish, and Tagalog to create a devastating portrait of her hometown. Craig Perez noted in a Rain Taxi review that \u201cthroughout Poeta, we witness the intersecting trajectories of body, self, culture and city.\u201d In a review for Bluefifth, Nicole Cartwright Denison commented that by \u201cdrawing heavily upon inspiration from Filipino creation myths, along with multiple biblical and classical allusions \u2026 Poeta en San Francisco transforms her hometown into the broader world teeming with struggle, with life wasted and wanted, with hope leaking from the edges.\u201d\nWith her husband, the poet Oscar Bermeo, Reyes coedits Doveglion Press, which publishes political literature. She has taught creative writing at Mills College and is an adjunct professor at the University of San Francisco\u2019s Yuchengco Philippine Studies Program.
