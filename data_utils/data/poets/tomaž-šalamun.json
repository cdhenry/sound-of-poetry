Early in his career he edited the literary magazine Perspektive and was briefly jailed on political charges. He studied art history at the University of Ljubljana, where he found poetry suddenly, as a revelation, describing its arrival in a 2004 interview as \u201cstones from the sky.\u201d\n\r\n\u0160alamun is the author of more than 40 collections of poetry in Slovenian and English. He published his first collection, Poker (1966), at the age of 25. His poetry, using elements of surrealism and polyphony, was influenced by the work of Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery,\u00a0Charles Simic, and Charles Baudelaire. His collections of poetry in\u00a0English\u00a0include\u00a0The Selected Poems of Toma\u017e \u0160alamun\u00a0(Ecco Press, 1998);\u00a0The Shepherd, the Hunter\u00a0(Pedernal, 1992);\u00a0The Four Questions of Melancholy\u00a0(White Pine Press, 1997);\u00a0Feast\u00a0(Harcourt, 2000), Ballad for Metka Krasovec (Twisted Spoon Press, 2001, translated by Michael Biggins), Poker\u00a0(Ugly Duckling Presse, 2nd edition 2008, translated by Joshua Beckman and \u0160alamun),\u00a0Row!\u00a0(Arc Publications, 2006),\u00a0The Book for My Brother\u00a0(Harcourt),\u00a0Woods and Chalices\u00a0(Harcourt, 2008, translated by Brian Henry),\u00a0There's the Hand and There's the Arid Chair\u00a0(Counterpath, 2009), and\u00a0On the Tracks of Wild Game\u00a0(Ugly Duckling Presse, 2012).\u00a0His poetry has been widely anthologized and translated into more than 20 languages.\n\r\n\u0160alamun\u00a0won the Jenko Prize, Slovenia\u2019s Pre\u0161eren and Mladost Prizes, and a Pushcart Prize. \u0160alamun and his German translator, Fabjan Hafner, were awarded the European Prize for Poetry by the German city of Muenster.\u00a0He was a Fulbright Fellow at Columbia University and taught occasionally in the United States. When he joined the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa, he met the Finnish American poet Anselm Hollo, who later became one of \u0160alamun\u2019s translators.\n\r\n\u0160alamun was a member of the Slovenian Academy of Science and Art and lived in Ljubljana, Slovenia, until his death in late 2014.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Eastern Europe"]}}
