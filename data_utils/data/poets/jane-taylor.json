A few of their poems, including \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle Little Star\u201d (first published as \u201cThe Star\u201d), later became nursery rhymes. The pair\u2019s publications include Original Poems for Infant Minds (1804), Rhymes for the Nursery (1806), Limed Twigs to Catch Young Birds (1808), City Scenes; or, A Peep into London: for good children (1809), Hymns for Infant Minds (1810), Original Hymns for Sunday School (1812), and The Linnet\u2019s Life: Twelve Poems (1822).\nTheir revision and expansion of an 18th-century book of humorous children\u2019s verse was published as Signor Topsy-Turvy\u2019s Wonderful Magic Lantern, or, The world turned upside down (1810), and the sisters also contributed significantly to The Associate Minstrels (1810), a book of children\u2019s poetry.\nFollowing her sister\u2019s marriage, Jane moved with her brother Isaac to his home in Devon, where she composed her first solo work, the children\u2019s novel Display: A Tale for Young People (1815), as well as the satire Essays in Rhyme on Morals and Manners (1816). She maintained her focus on children\u2019s literature and, beginning in 1816, was a regular contributor to Youth\u2019s Magazine.\n\r\nTaylor\u2019s work was widely reviewed and translated during her lifetime, and poet Robert Browning acknowledged her influence on his work. Contemporary critic Stuart Curran noted, \u201cTaylor\u2019s capacity to reveal the inner life as a thing is, it could be asserted, unrivaled in English literature before Dickens.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Romantic"]}}
