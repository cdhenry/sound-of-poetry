He served in US Army Air Corps during World War II, and was a merchant marine after. Appleman is known for his biting social commentary and masterful command of form. The author of numerous volumes of poetry, three novels, and half a dozen collections of prose, Appleman\u2019s range of subject matter includes Darwin, politics, morality, and sex.\nArt Seidenbaum in the Los Angeles Times described Appleman\u2019s second novel, Shame the Devil (1981), as entertaining and provocative: \u201cMost of our modern manners are [satirized]. ... Appleman wants to amuse and drop morals without moralizing; he\u2019s smart enough to do it swiftly, knowing the warp of satire soon wears thin.\u201d Appleman\u2019s poetry similarly skewers both literary conventions and contemporary mores. With illustrations by Arnold Roth, Appleman\u2019s collection Karma, Dharma, Pudding & Pie (2009) takes on large social issues with irreverence, wit, and formal prowess. Poet X.J. Kennedy alleges in the book\u2019s forward, \u201cAppleman is a master of the sonnet, the terse rhymed epigram, and even that fiendishly ingenious form, the double dactyl. To watch him sling words is to be richly regaled.\u201d The recipient of numerous awards, including a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Morley Award from the Poetry Society of America, and a Pushcart Prize, Appleman has served on the boards of the Poetry Society of America and the Poet\u2019s House. He has taught at SUNY Purchase, Columbia University, and is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus at Indiana University.\nA recognized expert on the life and work of Charles Darwin, Appleman edited the critical anthology Darwin (2001) and penned two books of poems on the 19th century naturalist, Darwin\u2019s Ark (1984) and Darwin\u2019s Bestiary (1986). Critics have singled out Appleman\u2019s grasp of Darwin\u2019s provocative theories and his ability to elucidate their social implications. Bette Chambers in the Humanist commented on the second edition of Darwin: \u201cLaypersons and scientists alike will treasure this new edition as an essential reference work. Appleman\u2019s own lucid style emerges in \u2018Darwin Among the Moralists\u2019 and \u2018Darwin: On Changing the Mind.\u2019\u201d Regarding the poems of Darwin\u2019s Ark, Stephen Jay Gould praised Appleman for having \u201ccaptured the elusive themes of Darwin\u2019s worldview and translat[ing] them into items of beauty that also provoke thought.\u201d Gould added that Appleman \u201cdeftly captures the meaning of Darwin\u2019s revolution,\u201d citing the \u201ccentral theme of continuity between man and nature.\u201d\nAppleman\u2019s poems and prose pieces have\u00a0appeared in dozens of publications, including the Nation, the New York Times, the New Republic, the Paris Review, Poetry, and the Yale Review. He is married to the playwright Marjorie Appleman.\n", "attrs": {}}
