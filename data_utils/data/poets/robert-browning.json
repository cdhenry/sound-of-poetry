His dramatic monologues and the psycho-historical epic\u00a0The Ring and the Book\u00a0(1868-1869), a novel in verse, have established him as a major figure in the history of English poetry. His claim to attention as a children\u2019s writer is more modest, resting as it does almost entirely on one poem, \u201cThe Pied Piper of Hamelin,\u201d included almost as an afterthought in\u00a0Bells and Pomegranites. No. III.\u2014Dramatic Lyrics\u00a0(1842) and evidently never highly regarded by its creator. Nevertheless, \u201cThe Pied Piper\u201d moved quickly into the canon of children\u2019s literature, where it has remained ever since, receiving the dubious honor (shared by the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen and J.M. Barrie\u2019s\u00a0Peter Pan) of appearing almost as frequently in \u201cadapted\u201d versions as in the author\u2019s original. His approach to dramatic monologue influenced countless poets for almost a century.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBrowning was born on May 7, 1812 in Camberwell, a middle-class suburb of London. He was the only son of Robert Browning, a clerk in the Bank of England, and a devoutly religious German-Scotch mother, Sarah Anna Wiedemann Browning. He had a sister, Sarianna, who like her parents was devoted to Browning. While Mrs. Browning\u2019s piety and love of music are frequently cited as important influences on the poet\u2019s development, his father\u2019s scholarly interests and unusual educational practices may have been equally significant. The son of a wealthy banker, Robert Browning the elder had been sent in his youth to make his fortune in the West Indies, but he found the slave economy there so distasteful that he returned, hoping for a career in art and scholarship. A quarrel with his father and the financial necessity it entailed led the elder Browning to relinquish his dreams so as to support himself and his family through his bank clerkship.\n\r\nBrowning\u2019s father amassed a personal library of some 6,000 volumes, many of them collections of arcane lore and historical anecdotes that the poet plundered for poetic material, including the source of \u201cThe Pied Piper.\u201d The younger Browning recalled his father\u2019s unorthodox methods of education in his late poem \u201cDevelopment,\u201d published in\u00a0Asolando: Fancies and Facts\u00a0(1889). Browning remembers at the age of five asking what his father was reading. To explain the siege of Troy, the elder Browning created a game for the child in which the family pets were assigned roles and furniture was recruited to serve for the besieged city. Later, when the child had incorporated the game into his play with his friends, his father introduced him to Alexander Pope\u2019s translation of the\u00a0Iliad. Browning\u2019s appetite for the story having been whetted, he was induced to learn Greek so as to read the original.\r\n\u00a0\r\nMuch of Browning\u2019s education was conducted at home by his father, which accounts for the wide range of unusual information the mature poet brought to his work. His family background was also important for financial reasons; the father whose own artistic and scholarly dreams had been destroyed by financial necessity was more than willing to support his beloved son\u2019s efforts. Browning decided as a child that he wanted to be a poet, and he never seriously attempted any other profession. Both his day-to-day needs and the financial cost of publishing his early poetic efforts were willingly supplied by his parents.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBrowning\u2019s early career has been characterized by Ian Jack as a search for an appropriate poetic form, and his first published effort,\u00a0Pauline: A Fragment of a Confession\u00a0(1833), proved in retrospect to be a false start. Browning\u2019s next poetic production,\u00a0Paracelsus\u00a0(1835), achieved more critical regard and began to move toward the greater objectivity of the dramatic monologue form that Browning perfected over the next several years. Browning also wrote several plays intended for the stage, along with closet dramas; however, he was not suited to be a playwright. His chief theatrical patron, William Macready, was already becoming disillusioned by the plays\u2019 lack of success and the poet\u2019s persistent difficulties in creating theatrical plots.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBefore that estrangement, however, the alliance between Browning and Macready had one salutary effect: it provided the occasion for Browning\u2019s composition of \u201cThe Pied Piper.\u201d In May 1842 Macready\u2019s son Willie was sick in bed; Willie liked to draw and asked Browning to give him \u201csome little thing to illustrate\u201d while in confinement. The poet responded first with a short poem, \u201cThe Cardinal and the Dog,\u201d and then, after being impressed with Willie\u2019s drawings for it, with \u201cThe Pied Piper of Hamelin.\u201d The story of the Pied Piper was evidently well known in Browning\u2019s home. The poet\u2019s father began his own poem on the subject in 1842 for another young family friend, discontinuing his effort when he learned of his son\u2019s poem. The primary source of the story was a 17th-century collection, Nathaniel Wanley\u2019s\u00a0Wonders of the Little World\u00a0(1678). Browning claimed many years later that this was the sole source, but William Clyde DeVane notes that some significant details in Browning\u2019s account, including an erroneous date for the event described, occur in an earlier work, Richard Verstegen\u2019s\u00a0Restitution of Decayed Intelligence in Antiquities\u00a0(1605), but not in Wanley.\n\r\nWhatever its sources, \u201cThe Pied Piper\u201d reflects the hand of a master storyteller. The poem tells a story of civic venality and retribution. Desperate to rid the city of rats, the corrupt and repulsively corpulent mayor engages the mysterious piper to charm the vermin away; the piper plays a tune that draws the rats from their holes and leads them to the river Weser, where they drown. Only one especially hardy rat escapes death\u2014by swimming across the river\u2014to tell a cautionary tale to other rats; the rat\u2019s story enables Browning to provide an explanation for the piper\u2019s magic, as the rat tells how the sound of the pipe evoked all kinds of wonderful treats for rats:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I heard a sound as of scraping tripe,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And putting apples, wondrous ripe,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In a cider-press\u2019s gripe;\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And a moving away of pickle-tub boards,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And a drawing the corks of train-oil flasks,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks.\nWith the rats destroyed and their nests blocked up, the mayor and corporation of Hamelin feel secure in reneging on their agreement with the piper and refuse to pay him the thousand guilders he demands. Where they had offered 50 times the piper\u2019s requested fee before the rats were eliminated, they now offer only 50 guilders, thinking of all the fine wines they might purchase with the money saved. After all, the mayor claims, the piper cannot restore the rats to life.\n\u201cThe Pied Piper\u201d has a great deal of charm, and both its theme and its moral reflect the mainstream of Victorian thought. Browning, however, seems to have held the poem in little esteem and reportedly only included it in\u00a0Dramatic Lyrics\u00a0because of the need for additional verse to fill out the 16-page pamphlet. Indeed, this narrative poem does not seem to fit comfortably with the dramatic monologue form of the other poems in the book, which include such widely anthologized pieces as \u201cMy Last Duchess\u201d and \u201cPorphyria\u2019s Lover.\u201d While \u201cThe Pied Piper\u201d found its own audience and John Forster\u2019s review of\u00a0Dramatic Lyrics\u00a0in\u00a0The Examiner\u00a0quoted favorably nearly half the poem, critical attention has usually focused on the other poems in the volume, the shorter dramatic monologues in which Browning finally found the form that would establish him as a major poet of his time and a significant influence on modern poetry.\nWhile \u201cThe Pied Piper\u201d differs from most of Browning\u2019s adult poetry, much of its charm and delight derive from the same poetic tools that Browning deployed in his more serious work. However, techniques that are praised in \u201cThe Pied Piper\u201d are frequently perceived as defects in the adult poems. Victorian critics disliked his predilection for outrageous (and sometimes unpronounceable) rhymes and the excessive use of single rhymes, as in the vivid account of the rat infestation that opens \u201cThe Pied Piper\u201d:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Rats!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They fought the dogs and killed the cats,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 And bit the babies in the cradles,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And ate the cheese out of the vats,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 And licked the soup from the cooks\u2019 own ladles,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Split open the kegs of salted sprats,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Made nests inside men\u2019s Sunday hats,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And even spoiled the women\u2019s chats.\nEarlier critics tended to see Browning\u2019s rhyme patterns as appropriate for light verse such as children\u2019s poems, where the emphasis is on entertainment, but as a defect in adult poetry, with its philosophical or religious concerns. The source of \u201cThe Pied Piper\u201d in arcane reference works from past centuries also suggests one of the problems Browning had in achieving an audience for his adult poetry: he was frequently attacked for obscurity in his verse, and much of that obscurity derives from his unreferenced allusions to the vast body of arcana that he had read.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAnother narrative poem, \u201c\u2018How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix,\u2019\u201c appeared in Browning\u2019s collection of dramatic monologues\u00a0Bells and Pomegranates. No. VII.\u2014Dramatic Romances & Lyrics\u00a0(1845). While not expressly written for children, this poem was printed separately in a child\u2019s edition after Browning\u2019s death and for many years was commonly included in children\u2019s school texts; it remains popular for its galloping anapestic rhythm and exciting description of a cross-country equestrian race. The poem presents an entirely imaginary 17th-century mission to relieve the city of Aix-la-Chapelle in Germany. Three riders are dispatched from Ghent, in Belgium, to carry an important message; two of the riders\u2019 horses fail, and the third, that of the speaker, accomplishes the mission to universal acclaim. What the message is, other than to secure the freedom of the German city, is never stated.\n\r\nBesides introducing the world to \u201cThe Pied Piper\u201d and establishing the poet\u2019s modus operandi for his future verse,\u00a0Dramatic Lyrics\u00a0also had a lasting effect on Browning\u2019s personal life. Elizabeth Barrett admired the book, and in her 1844 poem \u201cLady Geraldine\u2019s Courtship\u201d she expressed the esteem in which she held Browning by linking him to William Wordsworth and Alfred, Lord Tennyson as one of the great poets of the age. She met Browning and the two poets fell deeply in love, but Elizabeth\u2019s father, Edward Moulton Barrett, would not countenance any of his children marrying and leaving the home. On September 12, 1846 they were secretly married, and one week later they eloped to the Continent.\nBrowning wrote relatively little during the marriage, in part because the family frequently moved and, because of Elizabeth\u2019s frail health, he was usually busy making all the arrangements for housing and transportation. The Brownings had one child, Robert Wiedemann Barrett Browning, called \u201cPen,\u201d born in 1849 (the same year Browning\u2019s mother died). Both parents doted on the boy, and Robert Browning took particular responsibility for his son\u2019s education\u2014yet another diversion from poetic production. The poet who some years earlier had produced a major children\u2019s poem to amuse the son of a friend made no similar creations for his own son, however, but continued to work on longer philosophical poems for an adult audience.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBrowning became in his later years that curious phenomenon, the Victorian sage\u2014widely regarded for his knowledge and his explorations of philosophical questions of great resonance in Victorian life. He witnessed the creation (by F.J. Furnivall in 1881) of the Browning Society, dedicated to the study of the poet\u2019s work and thought. Just before his death in 1889, Browning finally published the other poem written for young Willie Macready, \u201cThe Cardinal and the Dog.\u201d This 15-line poem, like \u201cThe Pied Piper,\u201d originated in one of the legends recounted in Wanley\u2019s\u00a0Wonders of the Little World. It tells how Cardinal Crescenzio, a representative of the pope at the Council of Trent, was frightened by the apparition of a large black dog that only he could see, after which he became seriously ill; on his deathbed he again saw the dog. The poem has elicited little critical response and has seldom been anthologized; its interest today lies primarily in its role as a warm-up to \u201cThe Pied Piper.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAnyone as widely adulated as Browning was during the later years of his life is bound to suffer a decline in critical valuation. Along with other Victorians, Browning was dismissed by influential figures among the modernists, including T.S. Eliot (although Ezra Pound paid tribute to Browning as one of his literary fathers). Following World War II, however, Browning\u2019s reputation has been salvaged by a more objective generation of critics who note his poetic failings but also trace his influence on the poetic forms and concerns of his 20th-century successors. Through all the vicissitudes of critical reputation, however, Browning\u2019s major contribution to the canon of children\u2019s literature, \u201cThe Pied Piper of Hamelin,\u201d has retained its popular audience.\nAt the time of his death in 1889, he was one of the most popular poets in England.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Victorian"]}}
