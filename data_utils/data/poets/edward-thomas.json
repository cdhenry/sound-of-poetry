Although prominent critics and authors as Walter de la Mare, Aldous Huxley,\u00a0Peter Sacks,\u00a0Seamus Heaney, and Edna Longley called Edward Thomas one of England\u2019s most important poets, Thomas wrote all of his poetry over a three year span, 1914\u201317, and was much more widely known as a critic and prose writer during his lifetime. Despite affinities with the Georgian movement of the early 20th century United Kingdom, Edward Thomas\u2019s verse consistently defies classification. Like the work of his Georgian contemporaries, his poems display a profound love of natural beauty and, at times, an archaic use of diction. However, Thomas\u2019s personalized voice and intensity of vision give his poetry an artistic force which the Georgians never approached. In particular, Thomas\u2019s experiences of World War I, which echo and sometimes intrude on his poems, distinguish his work from his predecessors. Since 2000, much serious consideration has been given to Thomas\u2019s work. Most critics would agree with\u00a0Andrew Motion, who states that Thomas occupies \u201ca crucial place in the development of twentieth-century poetry\u201d for introducing a modern sensibility, later found in the work of such poets as\u00a0W.H. Auden\u00a0and\u00a0Ted Hughes, to the poetic subjects of Victorian and Georgian poetry.\u00a0\n\r\nThomas was born of Welsh parents in London. His father was a railway clerk who neglected his six sons in favor of politics and intellectual pursuits. Temperamentally, Edward\u2019s father was the opposite of his son, and the two disagreed on nearly all matters, including Thomas\u2019s desire for a literary career. Much later Thomas was to portray this adversarial relationship with his father in the poem \u201cP.H.T.\u201d In 1894, while attending St. Paul\u2019s School, Thomas met the successful literary journalist James Ashcroft Noble, who encouraged Thomas in his literary ambitions and was instrumental in getting his first book, The Woodland Life, accepted for publication. Shortly thereafter, while still a student at Lincoln College in Oxford, Thomas married Noble\u2019s daughter, Helen. Faced with the necessity of supporting a growing family, Thomas began accepting writing and reviewing assignments from London publishers. Much of the work he received was uncongenial, but Thomas wrote steadily, sometimes producing as many as three books a year. His work included essays, natural history, criticism, biographies, reviews, fiction, introductions, and topographical descriptions. Thomas wrote his first poems in 1914 at the urging of the American poet Robert Frost, with whom he forged a friendship during Frost\u2019s years in England. Two years later his first book of verse, Six Poems, was published. Due to Thomas\u2019s fear that it would be unfairly dismissed by the critics if it were published under his own name, this collection was published under the pseudonym of Edward Eastaway. These six were the only poems that Thomas lived to see in print: in 1915 he enlisted in the infantry and was killed two years later in the Battle of Arras, while the first edition of his Poems\u00a0(1917) was being prepared for press.\n\r\nThomas\u2019s many reviews and critical studies\u2014such as Richard Jefferies, Walter Pater, and The Feminine Influence on the Poets\u2014represent the best of his prose work. Much of Thomas\u2019s prose was written according to the demands and deadlines of his publishers. Many critics believe that Thomas wasted his talents on hack work, and the author himself felt that his artistic potential was being destroyed under the strain of constant production. Matthew Bevis, however, has noted that Thomas\u2019s prose paved the way for his poetry: \u201cThomas wrote some of the finest criticism of his generation, and that work was preparation for the poetry, not merely an avoidance of it,\u201d Bevis argues. \u201cWhen he lamented that Walter Pater used words as \u2018labels\u2019, or when he sensed that John Clare\u2019s words were \u2018alive\u2019 because they were \u2018still half-wild and imperfectly domesticated\u2019, Thomas was discovering what sort of writer he wanted to be.\u201d Thomas developed into a respected critic, and his reviews for various newspapers and journals were widely quoted. All of Thomas\u2019s criticism has been praised for its lucid style, precision of speech, and intelligent observations. Vernon Scannell has said that Thomas\u2019s \u201cverse criticism shows not merely an intuitive awareness of what poetry should be about, but an intelligent familiarity with refinements of technique and a fine sense of the historical continuity of English literature.\u201d\n\r\nWhile an accomplished prose writer, Thomas has become better known for the poetry which he began to write relatively late in his career. From his first poems, Thomas demonstrated, according to John Lehmann, an \u201cintensity of vision\u201d which set him apart from his contemporaries. His earliest poems bear the influence of Frost in their treatment of nature and in their simple style. However, Frost\u2019s influence was to decrease as Thomas discovered his own personal voice. Numerous critics, including Jeremy Hooker and J. P. Ward, have stressed the two principal themes in Thomas\u2019s poetry: one, the presence of war and its effect on the individual; the other, the poet\u2019s profound sense of solitude. Though he wrote only one war poem per se\u2014\u201cThis Is No Case of Petty Right or Wrong\u201d\u2014throughout his poetry Thomas subtly portrays the influence of war on the natural order. Thomas\u2019s sense of solitude has led Ward to consider him an early existentialist. Though this might be an isolated point of view, most critics agree that Thomas remains appealing to the modern reader\u2014while many of his contemporaries have fallen out of favor\u2014because his poetry expresses an awareness of individual alienation commonly associated with existentialism.\nThomas\u2019s life and work have increasingly received attention from poets and scholars. In 2012, Nick Dear wrote a play about the last seven years of Thomas\u2019s life, The Dark Earth and the Light Sky, and Matthew Hollis covered similar material in his account of Thomas\u2019s friendship with Frost, Now All Roads Lead to France: The Last Years of Edward Thomas (2012). Jean Moorcroft Wilson\u2019s full-scale biography of Thomas, Edward Thomas: From Adlestrop to Arras (2015) offered a frank assessment of Thomas\u2019s life, including his struggles with depression, marital troubles, and his many attempts at suicide. Reviewing the book for the Literary Review, Bevis noted that \u201ceven at his most tortured and torturing, he has a matter-of-fact resilience. \u2026 Poetry freed him from his motives. Or, rather, it freed him from his obsession with \u2018thinking out my motives for this or that act or word in the past until I long for sleep\u2019 by allowing him to observe and to create things he didn\u2019t feel the need to account for.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
