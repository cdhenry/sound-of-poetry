He earned a BA from New York University, an MA from the Johns Hopkins University Writing Seminars, an MFA from the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, and a PhD from Purdue University. His first collection of poetry, Green Squall\u00a0(2006), won a Yale Younger Poets Prize, a Great Lakes Colleges Association New Writers Award, a National \u201cBest Books\u201d Award from\u00a0USA Book News,\u00a0a Florida Book Award,\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0Foreword Reviews\u00a0Book of the Year Award.\u00a0His second collection,\u00a0The Abridged History of Rainfall\u00a0(2016), was a finalist for the 2016 National Book Award in Poetry. In his evocative and elegiac poems, Hopler engages the philosophical lyric tradition of\u00a0Wallace Stevens\u00a0and often draws on the tropical landscapes of Florida. According to poet\u00a0Katie Ford, \u201cHopler\u2019s vision and voice [are] both painfully complex because of how much of the world he allows to attach to him, to stake its claim on him.\u201d\nHopler is editor of\u00a0The Killing Spirit: An Anthology of Murder for Hire\u00a0(1998) and, with Kimberly Johnson,\u00a0Before the Door of God: An Anthology of Devotional Poetry (2013). He also edited and translated the collection The Museum of Small Dark Things: 25 Poems by Georg Trakl (2016). He is the recipient of numerous honors and awards, including a Fellowship from the Lannan Foundation, a Whiting Award, and the Rome Prize in Literature. He is Professor of English at the University of South Florida.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
