He earned a BA at Melbourne University and attended Yale University. Wallace-Crabbe\u2019s wry yet expansive poems mix high and low diction to sometimes startling effect. In the Times Literary Supplement, critic Eric Ormsby referred to Wallace-Crabbe as \u201ca genial smuggler of surprises,\u201d noting, \u201cHis uncommon affability, even when treating the gravest subjects, leaves the reader unprepared for his sudden luxuriance of phrase.\u201d \u00a0\nWallace-Crabbe is the author of more than a dozen collections of poetry, including By and Large (2001); Selected Poems 1956\u20131994 (1995), which won the Dinny O\u2019Hearn Poetry Prize; The Amorous Cannibal (1985), which won the Grace Leven Prize for Poetry; and Blood Is the Water (1969), which won the Farmer\u2019s Poetry Prize. He also published the novel Splinters (1981) and several critical works, including Read It Again (2005) and Falling into Language (1990). He has edited numerous anthologies, including Imagining Australia: Literature and Culture in the New New World (2004, with Judith Ryan), The Oxford Literary History of Australia (1998, with Bruce Bennett and Jennifer Strauss), and The Golden Apples of the Sun: Twentieth Century Australian Poetry (1980). \u00a0 In 2011, Wallace-Crabbe was awarded the Order of Australia. Over the course of his career, he has received the St. Michael\u2019s Medal, the Philip Hodgins Memorial Medal, the Human Rights Award for Poetry, and the Christopher Brennan Award for Literature.
