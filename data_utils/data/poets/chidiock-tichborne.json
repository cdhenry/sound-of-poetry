Though Catholicism was tolerated in England during Tichborne\u2019s early years, when Queen Elizabeth I was excommunicated by the pope in 1570, she reinstated a series of anti-Catholic measures in retaliation. In 1583, Tichborne was interrogated about relics he had gathered while traveling abroad; three years later, he joined the Babington conspirators who were plotting to kill the queen. He was apprehended and held in the Tower of London, where he composed a letter to his wife with the stanzas\u2014known as \u201cTichborne\u2019s Elegy\u201d\u2014concerning his impending death. Tichborne and a number of his coconspirators were disemboweled before they were hanged, a practice Queen Elizabeth prohibited in future executions when she learned of it.\r\n\u00a0\n\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Renaissance"]}}
