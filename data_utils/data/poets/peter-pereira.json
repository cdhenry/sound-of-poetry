{"pf_url": "https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/peter-pereira", "name": "Peter Pereira", "yob": "1959", "yod": null, "image": null, "bio": "\nPeter Pereira is a physician, a poet, and the founder of Floating Bridge Press. His poems are marked by their wit, humane observations, and range of both form and subject. In his collections\u00a0What\u2019s Written on the Body (2007) and Saying the World (2003), and his chapbook,\u00a0The Lost Twin (2000), he\u00a0seamlessly traverses his favorite themes, which include his work as a primary care provider at an urban clinic in Seattle, domestic life, suffering and the human condition, and the slippage of language. He is as comfortable with free-verse narratives as he is with anagrams, and Gregory Orr calls him \u201ca master of many modes, all of them yielding either wisdom or delight.\u201d Edward Byrne has praised his formal innovations, \u201cinventive use of language,\u201d and \u201cunexpected\u201d juxtapositions. Pereira\u2019s investigations have a prevailing undercurrent of celebration in the tradition of Walt Whitman, and even his deepest explorations of suffering are likely to be suffused with humor or hope.\nPereira\u2019s work has appeared in numerous publications, including Poetry, the Virginia Quarterly Review, and several anthologies, including Best American Poetry and To Come to Light: Perspectives on Chronic Illness in Modern Literature. He has received the \u201cDiscovery\u201d/The Nation and Hayden Carruth prizes, and has been a finalist for a Lambda Literary Award. He lives in Seattle, Washington.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
