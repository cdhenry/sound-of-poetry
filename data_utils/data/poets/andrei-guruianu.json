One is full of hardship yet luminosity. The other is full of irony and observation.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAs an editor, Guruianu\u00a0compiled the anthology Twenty Years after the Fall: A Retrospective in Poetry and Prose (2010) to commemorate the fall of the Iron Curtain and the 20-year anniversary of the Romanian revolution.
