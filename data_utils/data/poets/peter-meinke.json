He later earned an MA at the University of Michigan and a PhD at the University of Minnesota. He published his dissertation on the work of poet Howard Nemerov as a 1968 monograph in the University of Minnesota Press Pamphlets on American Writers series. He has published numerous volumes of poetry, including Lucky Bones (2014), The Contracted World: New & More Selected Poems (2006), Zinc Fingers (2000), Liquid Paper: New & Selected Poems (1991), The Night Train & the Golden Bird (1977), and the Russian-English poetry collection Maples and Orange Trees (2005). \u00a0 Witty, dark, and formally assured, Meinke explores family, daily life, and politics in his poems. Calling himself \u201cmore of a neighborhood poet than a state or Southern poet\u201d in an interview with Artsmania, Meinke went on to say, \u201cEven in America, where poetry isn\u2019t important to most people, everyone recognizes that at crucial times prose just doesn\u2019t cut it. When we fall in love, when we get married, or have a baby, when somebody dies, prose doesn\u2019t do it. We need poetry at these times. One of my ideas is that if people could work poetry into their daily lives, their daily lives would be better\u2014more pleasurable, more thoughtful. As a country we\u2019d have more imagination, and with more imagination there would be more empathy toward each other and toward the other countries in the world. We wouldn\u2019t be so eager to bomb Iran, or anyone else.\u201d  \u00a0 Meinke is also the author of the short story collections Unheard Music (2007) and The Piano Tuner (1986), which won a Flannery O\u2019Connor Award for Short Fiction, as well as the children\u2019s books Very Seldom Animals (1969, illustrated by Robert Hodgell) and The Legend of Larry the Lizard (1968, illustrated by Jeanne Clark Meinke, the poet\u2019s wife). She has also illustrated Meinke\u2019s nonfiction writing, including The Shape of Poetry: A Practical Guide to Writing & Reading Poems (2012) and Truth and Affection: The \u201cPoet\u2019s Notebook\u201d Columns from Creative Loafing (2013). \u00a0 In 2009, Meinke was appointed the inaugural poet laureate of St. Petersburg, Florida. His additional honors include two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts as well as an O. Henry Award and several prizes from the Poetry Society of America. He has taught at many colleges and universities, including Eckerd College, where he directed the Writer\u2019s Workshop for more than 20 years; the University of North Carolina at Greensboro; and the University of Tampa. Meinke lives in St. Petersburg.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"]}}
