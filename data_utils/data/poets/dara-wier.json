She teaches at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. The Harvard Review describes Wier's poems this way: \"many of Weir's stanzas draw a reader away from a recognizable world into one in which women waltz with bears, houseflies chat with colonels, and the absence of sound makes a material presence.\" Her most recent book is Reverse Rapture (2005), published by Verse Press.\n", "attrs": {}}
