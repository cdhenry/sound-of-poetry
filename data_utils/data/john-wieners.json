His poetry combines candid accounts of sexual and drug-related experimentation with jazz-influenced improvisation, placing both in a lyrical structure. In an interview with his editor, Raymond Foye, Wieners stated, \u201cI try to write the most embarrassing thing I can think of.\u201d As Robert Creeley observed, \u201cHis poems had nothing else in mind but their own fact.\u201d\nWieners earned a BA from Boston College and studied at Black Mountain College with\u00a0Robert Creeley,\u00a0Charles Olson, and\u00a0Robert Duncan. He later followed Olson, his mentor, to SUNY Buffalo. He\u00a0published his first book of poetry, The Hotel Wentley Poems (1958), at the age of 24. Numerous collections followed, including Ace of Pentacles (1964); Nerves (1970); Behind the State Capitol, or Cincinnati Pike (1975), a collection of letters, memoir, and poems; Selected Poems 1958\u20131984 (1986); and Cultural Affairs in Boston: Poetry & Prose 1956\u20131985 (1988).\nWieners\u2019s honors include awards from the Poets Foundation, the New Hope Foundations, and the National Institute of Arts and Letters, as well as a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. He founded and edited the literary magazine Measure (1957\u20131962).
