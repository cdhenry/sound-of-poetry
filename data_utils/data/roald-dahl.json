Instead of attending university, Dahl joined the Public Schools Exploring Society on a journey to Newfoundland and then worked as a salesman for Shell Oil in Dar es Salaam. At the start of World War II, he joined the Royal Air Force in Nairobi and survived a crash landing in the Libyan desert\u2014Dahl\u2019s first prose was an account of this crash. He began writing for children while raising five children with his first wife, actress Patricia Neal. As it did his childhood, tragedy marked Dahl\u2019s life as a father. His daughter Olivia died of measles at age seven, and his infant son, Theo, sustained brain damage in a car accident. After the accident, Dahl helped a toymaker and a neurosurgeon invent the Wade-Dahl-Till (WDT) shunt, which was used to treat thousands of children.  \u00a0 Perhaps because of his family experiences, Dahl\u2019s writing is darkly funny and staunchly loyal to a child\u2019s sense of fairness, magic, and revenge. Dahl began his writing career with fiction and nonfiction for adults. He published nine short story collections, including Over to You (1946); two novels, Sometime Never (1949) and My Uncle Oswald (1979); and several screenplays, including Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and the James Bond film You Only Live Twice. Dahl was awarded the Mystery Writers of America\u2019s Edgar Award three times. \u00a0 His 19 books for children include James and the Giant Peach (1961), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964), Whitbread Award\u2013winner The Witches (1983), and Matilda (1988), which won the Children\u2019s Book Award from the Federation of Children\u2019s Book Groups. \u00a0 He wrote two memoirs, Boy (1984) and Going Solo (1986), and is the subject of the biographies Roald Dahl: A Biography (1994), by Jeremy Treglown, and Storyteller: The Authorized Biography of Roald Dahl, by Donald Sturrock (2010). \u00a0 The Roald Dahl Foundation and Roald Dahl\u2019s Marvellous Children\u2019s Charity, established by his second wife, Felicity Dahl, offer grants in the areas of neurology and hematology. The Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre is located in Buckinghamshire, England, where Dahl spent most of his adult life. Dahl died in 1990 at a hospital in Oxford of a rare blood disorder. He was 74.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
