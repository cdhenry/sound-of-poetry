Troyan\u2019s work\u00a0explores the terror of becoming female amidst the accelerated haze of contemporary culture, deriving pleasure and power from interrogations of submission, violence, queer desire, sex work, horror, and capital.\u00a0By\u00a0engaging a practice of radical alterity, Christopher Higgs writes in a review at The Collagist,\u00a0\u201cThe question\u00a0Throne of Blood\u00a0seems interested in provoking is not the basic ontological question, 'what does it mean to be,' but rather a more rabidly black and potently nihilistic question: who gives a fuck about being? Or, put in the form of a statement rather than a question: to be is not to be, forget the question.\u201d At Vice, Blake Butler evinces another notion of being in\u00a0Kill Manual, as \u201cTroyan infects the struggle of the self into a living, breathing language-system, spitting and shrieking and cackling rather than just whining and worshipping, using reality's\u00a0death threat against itself.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
