All three books are collected In the Western Night: Collected Poems 1965-1990. His position in American letters has been solidified through his later works, including Desire, Star Dust, and Watching the Spring Festival. Much of Bidart\u2019s early work focuses on the origins and consequences of guilt. Among his most notable pieces are dramatic monologues presented through such characters as Herbert White, a child-murderer, and Ellen West, an anorexic woman. \u201cPart of his effectiveness comes simply from his ability as a storyteller,\u201d commented Michael Dirda in Washington Post Book World. \u201cYou long to discover what happens to his poor, doomed people.\u201d\n\r\nBidart grew up in California and entertained thoughts of becoming an actor or director when he was young. His plans changed, however, when he was introduced to literature at the University of California-Riverside. While an undergraduate, he became familiar with the work of T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. In a 1983 interview with Mark Halliday, included in\u00a0 In the Western Night, the poet spoke of how reading Pound\u2019s Cantos introduced him to the potential of poetry to encompass a wide range of subjects: \u201cThey were tremendously liberating in the way that they say that anything can be gotten into a poem, that it doesn\u2019t have to change its essential identity to enter the poem\u2014if you can create a structure that is large enough or strong enough, anything can retain its own identity and find its place there.\u201d\n\r\nAfter graduating from the University of California\u2014Riverside, Bidart continued his education at Harvard University. He was not, however, certain of where his course of study would lead him. Bidart related in his interview with Halliday: \u201cI took classes with half my will\u2014often finishing the work for them months after they were over; and was scared, miserable, hopeful. I wrote a great deal. I wrote lugubrious plays that I couldn\u2019t see had characters with no character. More and more, I wrote poems.\u201d Bidart\u2019s first attempts at poetry were, by his own admission, failures. \u201cThey were terrible; no good at all,\u201d he continued in his interview. \u201cI was doing what many people start out by doing, trying to be \u2018universal\u2019 by making the entire poem out of assertions and generalization about the world\u2014with a very thin sense of a complicated, surprising, opaque world outside myself that resisted the patterns I was asserting. These generalizations, shorn of much experience, were pretty simple-minded and banal.\u201d\n\r\nBidart submitted his work to Richard Howard, who was then editor of a poetry series at Braziller. Golden State was released in 1973. The book\u2019s most famous poem is \u201cHerbert White,\u201d which is told through the voice of a psychopathic child-murderer and necrophiliac. In his interview with Halliday, Bidart stated that his intent in writing the piece was to present \u201csomeone who was \u2018all that I was not,\u2019 whose way of \u2018solving problems\u2019 was the opposite of that of the son in the middle of the book. The son\u2019s way . . . involves trying to \u2018analyze\u2019 and \u2018order\u2019 the past, in order to reach \u2018insight\u2019; Herbert White\u2019s is to give himself a violent pattern growing out of the dramas of his past, a pattern that consoles him as long as he can feel that someone else has acted within it.\u201d In a review for Parnassus, Sharon Mayer Libera wrote that \u201cBidart\u2019s achievement, even a tour de force, is to have made [Herbert White] human. The narrator\u2019s gruesome adventures become the least important aspect of the monologue\u2014what is significant is his reaching out, in a language both awkward and alive, for the reasons he seeks power over his experience in peculiar and violent ways.\u201d\n\r\nBidart\u2019s second collection, The Book of the Body, includes several poems featuring characters struggling to overcome both physical and emotional adversity. The book opens with \u201cThe Arc,\u201d a series of musings by an amputee, and includes the dramatic monologue \u201cEllen West,\u201d spoken by a woman with anorexia. Based on a case study by noted psychiatrist Ludwig Binswanger, Edmund White regarded the poem as \u201ca work that displays Bidart\u2019s talents at their most exacting, their most insistent.\u201d\n\r\nBidart\u2019s early work often disregarded the conventions of poetry. In an appraisal of The Book of the Body, Helen Vendler stated that \u201cBidart\u2019s method is not narrative; unlike the seamless dramatic monologues we are used to, his are spliced together, as harrowing bits of speech, an anecdote, a reminiscence, a doctor\u2019s journal notes, a letter, an analogy, follow each other in a cinematic progression.\u201d Reviewers have also often drawn attention to Bidart\u2019s unusual typography, and to the liberties he takes with punctuation and capitalization. In his interview with Halliday, Bidart explained that \u201cthe only way I can sufficiently . . . express the relative weight and importance of the parts of a sentence\u2014so that the reader knows where he or she is and the \u2018weight\u2019 the speaker is placing on the various elements that are being laid out\u2014is [through] punctuation. . . Punctuation allows me to \u2018lay out\u2019 the bones of a sentence visually, spatially, so that the reader can see the pauses, emphases, urgencies and languors in the voice.\u201d\n\nThe Sacrifice, released in 1983, received widespread praise. Central to the volume is a thirty-page work titled \u201cThe War of Vaslav Nijinsky,\u201d As with most of his poetry, \u201cThe War of Vaslav Nijinsky\u201d went through a series of revisions as Bidart experimented with language and punctuation. \u201cThe Nijinsky poem was a nightmare,\u201d he remarked in his interview. \u201cThere is a passage early in it that I got stuck on, and didn\u2019t solve for two years.\u201d David Lehman praised Bidart\u2019s technique of alternating portions of the dancer\u2019s monologue with prose sections on Nijinsky\u2019s life. According to Lehman, \u201cthe result combines a documentary effect with an intensity rare in contemporary poetry.\u201d\n\r\nAlthough he has written in a variety of forms, Bidart\u2019s first books are best known for\u00a0 their dramatic monologues of troubled characters like Herbert White, Ellen West, and Vaslav Nijinsky. In his interview Bidart discussed how he is able to write in voices so different from his own: \u201cOnce I finally get the typed page to the point where it does seem \u2018right\u2019\u2014where it does seem to reproduce the voice I hear\u2014something very odd happens: the \u2018 being\u2019 of the poem suddenly becomes the poem on paper, and no longer the \u2018voice\u2019 in my head. The poem on paper suddenly seems a truer embodiment of the poem\u2019s voice than what I still hear in my head. I\u2019ve learned to trust this when it happens\u2014at that point, the entire process is finished.\u201d\n\r\nBidart\u2019s book Desire was nominated for the triple crown of awards\u2014the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award\u2014and received the 1998 Rebekka Bobbitt Prize from the Library of Congress for the best book of poetry published during the previous two years.\n\nDesire begins with thirteen short poems, including a memorial to artist Joe Brainard, who died of AIDS. William Logan said in New Criterion that these poems \u201cprepare the psychology of \u2018The Second Hour of the Night,\u2019 a masterwork whose first part is as good as anything Bidart has done\u201d The book\u2019s second half, \u201cThe Second Hour of the Night,\u201d is a recounting of Ovid\u2019s tale of Myrrha\u2019s incestuous love for her father, Cinyrus. Nation reviewer Langdon Hammer wrote that the poem \u201cis, in a sense, the worst case that could be made against desire: Sex makes people miserable; it leads them to destroy others and themselves. Yet Bidart converts his poem into an affirmation of embodied love.\u201d Hammer noted that the \u201cpre-existing forms\u201d in Desire include writing by Dante, Marcus Aurelius, and Catullus. \u201cBidart\u2019s mind,\u201d continued Hammer, \u201clike Ezra Pound\u2019s, is full of writing. The experience he records is first of all the experience of a compassionate, intensive reader. What he cares about most is not the content of prior texts but what it feels like to enter them, and then to carry them inside you.\u201d\n\r\nBidart told Lambda Book Report interviewer Timothy Liu, \u201cI think \u2018The Second Hour of the Night\u2019 is a poem I\u2019ve been trying to write all my life. . . . I wanted to write a poem that questioned love, and in some sense, to punish love as far as one could\u2014and see what remained. Not out of the illusion that one could destroy the desire for love, but to devour as many sentimentalities and delusional aspects as possible, certainly to question the traditional assumptions about love.\u201d\n\r\nBidart\u2019s sixth book, Star Dust, was published in 2005. Like Desire, it is divided in two parts. The first section is composed of the short poems published as the Pulitzer-prize nominated chapbook \u201cMusic like Dirt,\u201d and the second of eight short lyrics and a long narrative poem that continues the series Bidart began in Into the Western Night. Like the rest of the collection, \u201cThe Third Hour of the Night\u201d focuses on the human urge to make or create, but does so by subverting the process described in the first half. Jacob Edmund, the Boston Review, wrote that \u201cthe failure to realize \u2018the human need to make\u2019 in the first section becomes an effort to make by unmaking the self in the second. The two sections interpenetrate, mirror, and modify one another, creating a dynamic and impressively realized whole.\u201d \u201cThe Third Hour of the Night\u201d tells the story of Benvenuto Cellini, a contemporary of Michelangelo\u2014and a sorcerer\u2014who struggles to complete a bronze statue of Perseus holding Medusa\u2019s head. The intense drive towards creation, the way we shape and give form to experience, is the central theme of Star Dust. Reviewing the book for the New York Times, Langdon Hammer noted that Bidart\u2019s emphasis was both on the way we shape \u201cor mis-shape\u201d our lives: \u201cThe qualification is important. Making is our best chance for meaning, he [Bidart] insists. \u2018\u2018Without clarity about what we make,\u2019\u2019 however, it becomes \u2018\u2018a curse, a misfortune\u2019; and what each of us must make, let alone how to make it, is never clear.\u201d The book, which was nominated for a National Book Award, employed familiar Bidart typography\u2014block capital, italics, blank space\u2014and techniques such as dramatic monologue, quotation, and paraphrase.\n\r\nBidart\u2019s recent books include\u00a0Watching the Spring Festival (2008), his first book of lyric poems;\u00a0and\u00a0Metaphysical Dog (2013), which won the National Books Critics Circle Award and was a finalist for the National Book Award. His Half-Light: Collected Poems 1965-2016 won the National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize in Poetry.\n", "attrs": {}}
