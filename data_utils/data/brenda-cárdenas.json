She writes in a blend of English and Spanish, which she has said reflects her interest in \u201cthe interconnectedness and juxtapositions of difference and similarity between seemingly disparate peoples, events, places, and experiences.\u201d While C\u00e1rdenas often writes in free verse, she also experiments with a variety of forms, and, as Craig Santos Perez has noted, \u201cThis syncretic formal impulse reflects the polyphonic texture of C\u00e1rdenas\u2019s language-scape.\u201d Her poetry has appeared in a number of anthologies and journals, including The City Visible: Chicago Poetry for the New Century (2007) and The Wind Shifts: New Latino Poetry (2007). She is a professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and was Milwaukee\u2019s poet laureate from 2010 to 2012.\n", "attrs": {}}
