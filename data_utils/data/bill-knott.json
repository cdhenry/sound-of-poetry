Poet Thomas Lux wrote of the collection: \u201cThe best poems in this first collection \u2026 confront the reader with their directness and imagination\u2026 . They\u2019re poems of anguish and frustration because the poet takes responsibility.\u201d Knott\u2019s poems are sometimes surreal, with startling juxtaposed images. Critic Meghan O\u2019Rourke noted the variety of forms in Knott\u2019s poetry, identifying the simple style of some poems and the \u201chighly-torqued syntactic compression\u201d of others. In The Unsubscriber, she found \u201cthe mode alternately heroic and vernacular, the subjects ranging from ecocide to the degradations of age to meditations on the sword of Damocles and Rilke\u2019s archaic torso.\u201d\u00a0Knott self-published many collections of his work, which are available for free through his website.\nKnott, who was an orphan, spent a year in an institution for the mentally ill in Elgin, Illinois, when he was 15; he worked with his uncle at a farm in Michigan, spent two years in the army, and wrote his first book while working as a hospital orderly. He taught for many years at Emerson College in Boston. He died in 2014.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
