His work has been anthologized numerous times, including A Sulfur Anthology (2015) and The Collected Explosive Magazine (2017). Keckler has published widely in magazines, including Fence, Zeitzoo, Columbia Poetry Review, Sulfur, Talisman, the Washington Review, and the New Orleans Review. Susan Smith Nash said of Keckler\u2019s first collection that he writes \u201cFluid, thoughtful, gorgeous poems. Some connect the reader with the challenge of re-perceiving everydayness, others recall the perverse ironies of Emily Dickinson. Subtle wordplay and quick intelligences recall Stevens, but updated and more fleshy and playful.\u201d His translations of two early novellas by Andr\u00e9 Malraux were published as The Kingdom of Farfelu (Fugue State Press, 2005).\nKeckler has received fellowships in poetry from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, and he is the recipient of two Gertrude Stein Awards in Innovative American poetry. He is also a visual artist and his artwork has been published in numerous magazines and books. He is currently represented by the Dan Skj\u00e6veland Gallery (Norway). He resides in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n", "attrs": {}}
