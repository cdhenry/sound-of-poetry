She is the great-granddaughter of Greek poet Angelos Sikelianos and the niece of Anne Waldman. She is the author of eight\u00a0poetry collections, including\u00a0Make Yourself Happy\u00a0(2017),\u00a0The Loving Detail of the Living & the Dead\u00a0(2013),\u00a0Body Clock\u00a0(2008), and\u00a0The California Poem\u00a0(2004). She is also author of the hybrid memoirs\u00a0You Animal Machine (The Golden Greek)\u00a0(2014) and\u00a0The Book of Jon\u00a0(2004).\nSikelianos work negotiates the boundary between poetry and prose and other forms of documentation, including visual art and notebook writing. Speaking to reviewer Ann Beman about\u00a0You Animal Machine,\u00a0which explores the history of Sikelianos\u2019s grandmother, a former burlesque dancer, through found and imagined materials, Sikelianos articulated her relationship to form and hybrid projects: by being \u201cconscious of the way our vision is blocked,\u201d Sikelianos stated, she is \u201cmore interested in the ways we don\u2019t see, in blindness, rather than in what we do. \u2026 The shifting forms are a way to see around corners.\u201d\nSikelianos has received numerous honors and awards for her writing and translations, including fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Fulbright Commission, and Princeton University, where she was a Seeger fellow. She has held residencies at Yaddo,\u00a0the Lannan Foundation in Marfa,\u00a0and La Maison des \u00c9crivains \u00c9trangers in Brittany and is the recipient of two Gertrude Stein Awards for Innovative American Writing, a New York Foundation for the Arts Award in Nonfiction Literature, a James D. Phelan Award, and a New York State Council for the Arts Translation Award. On guest faculty at the Naropa Summer Writing Program, she teaches in the\u00a0Literary Arts Program at Brown University and lives\u00a0with her husband, the novelist Laird Hunt.\n", "attrs": {}}
