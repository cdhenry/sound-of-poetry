He is the son of the artist, author, and pioneering art therapist Selwyn Dewdney. He is the author of more than ten books of poetry, including Predators of the Adoration (1983) and Radiant Inventory (1998), nominated for the Canadian Governor General\u2019s Award. Two other books were also nominated for the Governor General\u2019s Award: The Immaculate Perception (1986), which includes poetry and essays on language, consciousness, and dreams and won a CBC Literary Competition, and Acquainted with the Night: Excursions Through the World After Dark (2004). Dewdney\u2019s other poetry collections include Demon Pond (1994) and The Natural History (2002). Works of nonfiction include Last Flesh: Life in the Transhuman Era (1998) and Soul of the World: Unlocking the Secrets of Time (2008).\n\r\nDescribing the effect of his childhood, in which \u201cthere was as much art around the house as there was science,\u201d on his poetry, Dewdney once said, \u201cMy poetry is warped out of science. I think I\u2019m a frustrated scientist in poetry and a frustrated poet in science. \u2026 All poetry deals with information, finally.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Canada"]}}
