Her collections of poetry include\u00a0The Exchange (2013),\u00a0The Descent (2004), which won the Connecticut Book Award, and\u00a0The Misunderstanding of Nature (1994), which won the Poetry Society of America\u2019s Norma Farber First Book Award. Black\u2019s lyrical poems are both revelatory and elusive, exploring a landscape sharpened with grief and devotion. As a reviewer for the Los Angeles Times Book Review noted, \u201cSophie Cabot Black ... is absolutely direct and absolutely removed\u2014a strange confluence of tones that is both intellectually provocative and deeply moving.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s poetry has been anthologized in Best American Poetry and Never Before: Poems About First Experiences (2005). Her essays have been included in Wanting a Child (1998).\nHer honors include the Grolier Poetry Prize and the Poetry Society of America\u2019s John Masefield Memorial Award, as well as fellowships from the MacDowell Colony, the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, and the Bunting Institute at Radcliffe College. Black has taught at The New School, Rutgers University, and Columbia University, the 92nd St Y and the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown. She divides her time between\u00a0New England, New York, and Colorado.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
