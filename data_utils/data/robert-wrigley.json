He was drafted in 1971, but was discharged as a conscientious objector. The first in his family to graduate from college, and the first male for generations to escape work in a coal mine, Wrigley earned his MFA from the University of Montana, where he studied with\u00a0Madeline DeFrees,\u00a0John Haines, and\u00a0Richard Hugo.\n\r\nHis collections of poetry include\u00a0Box\u00a0(Penguin, 2017);\u00a0Anatomy of Melancholy & Other Poems\u00a0(Penguin, 2013), winner of the\u00a0Pacific Northwest Book Award;\u00a0Beautiful Country\u00a0(Penguin, 2010);\u00a0Earthly Meditations: New and Selected Poems\u00a0(2006);\u00a0Lives of the Animals\u00a0(2003), winner of the Poets Prize;\u00a0Reign of Snakes\u00a0(1999), winner of the Kingsley Tufts Award; and\u00a0In the Bank of Beautiful Sins\u00a0(1995), winner of the San Francisco Poetry Center Book Award and finalist for the Lenore Marshall Award from the Academy of American Poets.\u00a0\nWrigley believes that poetry can influence the world and people\u2019s lives rather than just reside within the confines of academia. He holds that \u201cpoetry can have a redemptive function. It can look at the chaos you see and make a kind of sense of the smallest part of it.\u201d His poems are concerned with rural Western landscapes and humankind\u2019s place within the natural world, and he aims to \u201ctell all the truth, but make it sing.\u201d\u00a0Wrigley cites Keats and Stevens as major influences and aligns himself more closely to the unifying goals of Modernism than to the disjunctions of Postmodernism. While his voice has been fairly consistent throughout his career, his sequence \u201cEarthly Meditations,\u201d in\u00a0Reign of Snakes\u00a0(1999), marks a departure from his established style and cadences. Notable for its emphatically sound-driven nature, Wrigley\u2019s five-part meditation was written within the span of two weeks and is steeped in the voices of\u00a0Theodore Roethke,\u00a0Sylvia Plath,\u00a0Galway Kinnell, and\u00a0Dylan Thomas.\n\r\nWrigley won the J. Howard and Barbara M.J. Wood Prize,\u00a0Poetry\u00a0magazine\u2019s Frederick Bock Prize, the Poetry Society of America\u2019s Celia B. Wagner Award,\u00a0Poetry Northwest\u2019s Theodore Roethke Award, and five Pushcart Prizes.\u00a0He has been awarded fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the Idaho Commission on the Arts. His poems have been widely anthologized, twice included in\u00a0Best American Poetry, and featured on NPR\u2019s\u00a0The Writer\u2019s Almanac.\n\r\nWrigley has taught at Lewis-Clark State College, Warren Wilson College, the University of Oregon, the University of Montana, and the University of Idaho. He lives in Idaho with his wife, the writer Kim Barnes.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
