A popular author, journalist, and poet of the mid-19th century, he wrote for various publications and periodicals, including the Saturday Press, Vanity Fair, and Weekly Review under the name \u201cMcArone,\u201d which brought him recognition as a humorist. In addition to humorous pieces, Arnold also wrote poetry and published books on children\u2019s games. He was best known for his poem \u201cThe Jolly Old Pedagogue\u201d as well as the McArone Papers, which he wrote under his pseudonym. Arnold was also a patron of Pfaff\u2019s Beer Cellar, a popular watering hole for a group of New York bohemian writers and artists, including Walt Whitman. \u00a0\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
