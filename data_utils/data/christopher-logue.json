There was no substance to it.\u201d He is best known for his innovative adaptations of Homer\u2019s Iliad, which he has been producing since receiving a BBC radio commission in the late 1950s.\n\r\nHumbly referring to himself as \u201ca rewrite man\u201d in his 2006 interview for the Guardian, Logue has adapted and edited the books of Homer\u2019s Iliad in modern, cinematic blank verse while retaining the storyline of the original, creating a bold hybrid of translation, adaptation, and invention. An autodidact with no knowledge of ancient Greek, Logue, inspired by Ezra Pound\u2019s early Cantos, uses previously published translations as springboards for his accessible, vivid adaptations. War Music (2003), a revision of his first three installments of books from the Iliad, was shortlisted for the International Griffin Poetry Prize. Cold Calls (2005), winner of the Whitbread Poetry Award, showcased Logue\u2019s ability to \u201cre-enact and reinvigorate Homer\u2019s poem,\u201d according to Guardian critic Charles Bainbridge.\n\r\nIn addition to his accounts of Homer, Logue has also published numerous collections of politically engaged and jazz-influenced poetry. His Selected Poems was published in 1996. Logue has also written screenplays, memoirs, and, under the pen name Count Palmiro Vicarion, pornographic fiction, ballads, and limericks. He has edited anthologies of children\u2019s poetry, including The Children\u2019s Book of Children\u2019s Rhymes (1986), and has translated Bertolt Brecht\u2019s The Seven Deadly Sins (1986). His autobiography, Prince Charming, was published in 2001.\n\r\nLogue has won the Paris Review/Bernard F. O\u2019Connor Award and has been honored by the queen of England as a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for his contributions to literature.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
