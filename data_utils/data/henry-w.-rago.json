Rago graduated from the DePaul College of Law in 1937. After passing the bar exam, he earned degrees in theology and philosophy from the University of Notre Dame. Rago served in counterintelligence during World War II before returning to the US to teach at the University of Chicago, where he taught both theology and literature from 1947 until just before his death. \u00a0 Rago published one collection of poetry during his lifetime: A Sky of Late Summer (1963). Rago\u2019s spare, lyrical work often explores themes of religion and philosophy.  \u00a0 Following Karl Shapiro\u2019s tenure, Rago was appointed Poetry\u2019s editor in 1955, a role he held for 14 years. While editor of Poetry, Rago published a wide range of poets, including the Black Mountain poets, Deep Image poets, and members of the New York School. In addition to his role as Poetry\u2019s editor, Rago co-edited Poems in Folio (1957 and 1958) with Stanley Kunitz and Richard Wilbur. He also served as a reviewer for Commonweal. \u00a0 Rago died at the age of 53, shortly after resigning from his post at Poetry. With the support of a Ford Foundation grant, he had planned to devote a year to working on a new book manuscript, The Vocation of Poetry, before returning to a fulltime teaching position at the University of Chicago. \u00a0 Rago was married to the painter Juliet Rago, with whom he had four children. Recordings of his poems are held in the Library of Congress and Harvard University\u2019s Woodberry Poetry Room. His papers are held at the Lilly Library of Indiana University.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
