Educated at Goshen College, she earned a BA, an MA in creative writing, and a PhD from New York University.\n\r\nKasdorf\u2019s lyrical poems, steeped in her family\u2019s Mennonite background, explore faith, social justice, and cultural inheritance. In an interview with Melissa Beattie-Moss, Kasdorf described how motherhood has affected the concerns of her poetry, noting, \u201cYou\u2019re both incredibly drawn to the small and the domestic, and you\u2019re also suddenly very sensitive to matters of the world. Your attention is pulled urgently in two directions.\u201d\n\r\nKasdorf\u2019s poetry collections include Eve\u2019s Striptease (1998); Sleeping Preacher (1992), which won the Agnes Lynch Starrett Poetry Prize and the Great Lakes Colleges Association Award for New Writing;\u00a0Poetry in America (2011); and Shale Play: Poems and Photographs from the\u00a0Fracking Fields\u00a0(2018), with photographs by Steven Rubin. She is also the author of the essay collection The Body and the Book: Writing from a Mennonite Life (2001) and the biography Fixing Tradition: Joseph W. Yoder, Amish American (2002).\u00a0\n\r\nKasdorf co-edited, with Michael Tyrell, Broken Land: Poems of Brooklyn (2007). With Joshua R. Brown, she edited a restored edition of J.W. Yoder\u2019s Rosanna of the Amish (2008) and Fred Lewis Pattee's The House of the Black Ring: A Romance of the Seven Mountains\u00a0(2012). Kasdorf has received a Pushcart Prize as well as grants and fellowships from the Pennsylvania Arts Council and the Fetzer Institute. Her poems have often been featured on Garrison Keillor\u2019s National Public Radio program The Writer\u2019s Almanac, and have appeared in Prairie Schooner, The\u00a0Gettysburg Review, and the Antioch Review.\u00a0\n\r\nShe has taught at Pennsylvania State University, the University of Pittsburgh, and New York University, and lives in Pennsylvania.\ufeff\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
