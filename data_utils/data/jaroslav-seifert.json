He was born into a working-class family near Prague and joined the avant-garde poetry group Dev\u011btsil as a young man. In 1929, working as a journalist and an editor, he was expelled from the Communist Party for voicing his criticism of the party platform. The tenor of his work, and its reception, changed during the German occupation and subsequent Communist takeover. In 1956, his criticism of the Communists made it difficult for him to publish new work. The changing political climate of the 1960s resulted in his appointment as National Artist of Czechoslovakia in 1967, and in 1969, he was elected chairman of the Czechoslovakian Writers\u2019 Union.\nA visit to France in the 1920s introduced him to surrealism and modernist writers, yet Seifert\u2019s work remained close to his working-class beginnings as well as being influenced by current events and a sense of nationalism. The Nobel Prize committee described him as a poet \u201cloved as dearly for the astonishing clarity, musicality and sensuality of his poems as for his unembellished but deeply felt identification with his country and its people.\u201d He often wrote of love, and his poems show a commitment to art that transcended politics. Seifert published his first book of poems, M\u011bsto v slz\u00e1ch, in 1921, eventually publishing 30 books of poems and a memoir. His work is available in English translation in Mozart in Prague: Thirteen Rondels (1985, Tom O\u2019Grady and Paul Jagasich, trans.), Early Poetry of Jaroslav Seifert (1997, Dana Loewy, trans.), The Poetry of Jaroslav Seifert (1998, George Gibian and Ewald Osers, trans.), and The Casting of Bells (2008, O\u2019Grady and Jagasich, trans.). Seifert died in 1986.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Eastern Europe"]}}
