His father was in the millinery business and the family moved several times during Reznikoff\u2019s childhood, often to non-Jewish neighborhoods, where he experienced the virulent anti-semitism that influenced his self-identification as an outsider and informed much of his later writing. Reznikoff was intellectually precocious and entered high school three years ahead of schedule; he graduated from Brooklyn\u2019s Boys High School at the age of 15. A year later, in 1910, he entered the University of Missouri\u2019s School of Journalism, where he remained for a year before returning to New York. In 1912, he entered the New York University Law School; he was 18 years old. Although he graduated in 1915 and was admitted to the New York Bar a year later, he practiced law for a very short time and concentrated instead on his writing. In 1917, Reznikoff joined the ROTC at Columbia University, but the war ended before he completed his training. He worked briefly for his father in the hat-making business, then as a freelance writer and editor. He also began publishing his poems and plays; however, very little of his work was critically or commercially successful. In 1930, Reznikoff mar\u00adried Marie Syrkin, a high school teacher. That same year, he published the novel\u00a0By the Waters of Manhat\u00adtan,\u00a0a work that earned him a fair amount of recogni\u00adtion, but few royalties. In 1931, some of his poems\u00a0were included in\u00a0Poetry\u00a0magazine\u2019s special issue on the Objectivist movement edited by Louis Zukofsky, who also discussed Reznikoff\u2019s work in his essay outlining the principles of the movement. Economic conditions during the Great Depression forced Rezni\u00adkoff to take a job for a legal publishing company as the editor of\u00a0Corpus Juris,\u00a0a reference book for lawyers. He left after a few years and returned to his writing career, by this time earning a sufficient amount of money to live on. During the 1940s, Reznikoff\u2019s wife took a position at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, while he remained in Manhattan; the couple then lived apart except for weekends and holidays until his wife\u2019s retirement from Brandeis in 1966 when she rejoined him in New York. Reznikoff continued to write and publish throughout the 1960s and early 1970s until his death on January 22, 1976, after suffering a heart attack the previous day.\n\r\nCharles Reznikoff\u2019s first two volumes of verse,\u00a0Rhythms\u00a0(1918) and\u00a0Rhythms II\u00a0(1919) were both printed on a small press in his parents\u2019 home. A year later, his first com\u00admercially produced volume,\u00a0Poems,\u00a0appeared, but most of the other poems from the early 1920s were published in periodicals. During this same period, Reznikoff was writing plays, some of them in verse, in addition to his poetry, but most of the plays were poorly received. In 1927, he issued\u00a0Five Groups of Verse\u00a0and\u00a0Nine Plays,\u00a0most of which had been published previously. Following that publication, he apparently gave up on play writing. During the 1930s and early 1940s, he published only two more volumes of poetry:\u00a0Jerusalem the Golden\u00a0(1934) and\u00a0Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down\u00a0(1941).\u00a0His next important volume of poetry did not appear until 1962 when he published\u00a0By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse;\u00a0the title causes some confusion since he had earlier written a novel titled\u00a0By the Waters of Manhattan.\u00a0Similar confusion arises between\u00a0Testimony,\u00a0a collection of prose narratives published in 1934, and the poetry volumes\u00a0Testimony: The United States, 1885-1890: Recitative\u00a0(1965) and\u00a0Testimony: The United States, 1891-1900: Recitative\u00a0(1968). Reznikoff\u2019s work from the 1960s and 1970s includes By the Well of Living and Seeing, and The Fifth Book of the Maccabees (1969) and By the Well of Living & Seeing: New & Selected Poems, 1918-1973 (1974).\nAlthough Reznikoff responded to the threat posed by the Nazis in the 1930s, notably in the poems\u00a0In Memoriam, 1933\u00a0and \u201cA Compassionate People,\u201d his most powerful works on the fate of European Jews did not appear until much later with the publication of\u00a0Holocaust\u00a0in 1975, following a long silence on the subject after the war. Using the Nuremberg and Eichmann trials as source material, the volume transforms courtroom testimony into poetry. The first volume of Reznikoff\u2019s collected poems, Poems 1918-1936, was published in 1976; however it would take another 13 years for his complete poetic output to appear, as\u00a0Poems 1918-1975: The Complete Poems of Charles Reznikoff\u00a0(1989; 2005). And the two volumes of Testimony would not be published together until 2015.\nWriter Paul Auster described Reznikoff as \u201ca poet of the eye,\u201d explaining that for Reznikoff \u201ceach poetic utterance is an emanation of the eye, a transcription of the visible into the brute, unciphered code of being. Which means that the act of writing is not so much an ordering of the real as a discovery of it.\u201d Milton Hindus also notes the visual quality of Reznikoff\u2019s work, contending that the poet had an \u2018\u201ceye for resemblances,\u2019 which could take the most commonplace scene and transform it with an unforgettable metaphor.\u201d Rocco Marinaccio maintains that Reznikoff\u2019s poetry was similar to the writings of the era\u2019s crusading journalists; many of the things Reznikoff saw and reported to his readers involved the exposure of social injustice and inequal\u00adity. According to Marinaccio, Reznikoff \u201cspent a lifetime writing about the disenfranchised, relentlessly and incisively detailing the plights of the working class, women and children, racial and ethnic minori\u00adties, immigrants, and artists, many of them living in wretched poverty.\u201d\nAs the child of Russian Jews who emigrated to the United States, Reznikoff wrote about Jewish themes, as well as themes of exile, of being cut off from the ethnic background of his parents while, at the same time, never quite fitting into American life. Thus, much of his work deals with loneliness and isolation; as Auster puts it, Reznikoff is \u201cthe poet as solitary wanderer, as man in the crowd, as faceless scribe,\u201d who walks through the city space, observing it from the vantage point of an outsider, and recording those observations in his poetry. Bob Perelman notes that while Reznikoff\u2019s early writing involves the lives of Jewish immigrants in America, \u201chis later poems tend to be short ruminations of a solitary walker noticing bushes, birds, clouds, pedestrians,\u201d characterized by \u201cloneliness\u201d and \u201ca touch of solipsism.\u201d For Stephen Fredman, \u201cthe heart of the Jew\u00adish dilemmas in Charles Reznikoff\u2019s writing\u201d is best\u00a0demonstrated by his treatment of the Hebrew language. Ranen Omer reports that although Reznikoff was \u201ca thoughtful chronicler of the major currents in Jewish history,\u201d as well as of his own lifetime, he rarely discussed zionism, thus offering \u201can alternative model of ethnic identity\u201d for Jewish Americans apart from their relationship to Israel and/or the Holocaust.\nReznikoff\u2019s poetic response to the Holocaust has been criticized as far too factual to convey the horror of the events. Robert Franciosi, however, refutes the charges that the presentation of documentary facts amounts to an oversimplification and dehumanization of the experiences of the victims. According to Franciosi, in his use of testimonies Reznikoff \u201cdoes not surrender the emotional and moral authority with which they were delivered to austere factuality, does not sacrifice the witnesses\u2019 humanity ... to a naive gesture toward the \u2018neutral\u2019 documentation of historical or political events.\u201d Charles Bernstein calls\u00a0Holocaust\u00a0\u201dthe most unrelentingly painful to read of Reznikoff\u2019s work,\u201d and at the same time believes that it is his \u201cmost problematic work at a technical\u2014in the sense of aesthetic or formal\u2014level.\u201d Reznikoff had used the documentary approach in the earlier two-volume work\u00a0Testimony,\u00a0which Bernstein calls \u201cperhaps the darkest, and certainly most unrelenting, of modernist long poems.\u201d The work, like\u00a0Holocaust,\u00a0is based on court records, in this case detailing racism, violence, negligence, and injustice in American life. Auster claims that\u00a0Testimony\u00a0is \u201cat once a kaleidoscopic vi\u00adsion of American life and the ultimate test of Reznikoff\u2019s poetic principles.\u201d David Guest discusses the effectiveness of both\u00a0Testimony\u00a0and\u00a0Holocaust,\u00a0explaining that both \u201care notable for describing emotionally charged events in voices lacking in emotional force.\u201d Yet despite the \u201cflat tone of these narratives\u201d they nonetheless \u201cmanage to convey powerful emotion.\u201d\nCharles Reznikoff received the Morton Dauwen Zabel Award from the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1971. After his death in 1976,\u00a0Reznikoff\u2019s publisher John Martin, of Black Sparrow Press, discovered an unpublished novel among his papers. This was published as The Manner Music, with an introduction by Robert Creeley.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"], "School/Period:": ["Objectivist"]}}
