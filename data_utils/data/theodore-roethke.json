Born in Saginaw, Michigan, his father was a German immigrant who owned and ran a 25-acre greenhouse. Though as a child he read a great deal and as a high school freshman he had a Red Cross campaign speech translated into 26 languages, he suffered from issues of abandonment and loss, and his lack of self-esteem led him to strive to be accepted by peers. When he was 14, his father died of cancer and his uncle committed suicide. He attended the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where he adopted a tough, bear-like image (weighing over 225 pounds) and even developed a fascination with gangsters. Eccentric and nonconformist\u2014he later called himself \u201codious\u201d and \u201cunhappy\u201d\u2014Roethke yearned for a friend with whom he could talk and relate his ambitions. Poet and writer James Dickey once named Roethke the greatest of all American poets: \u201cI don't see anyone else that has the kind of deep, gut vitality that Roethke's got. Whitman was a great poet, but he's no competition for Roethke.\u201d His difficult childhood, his bouts with bipolar disorder, and his ceaseless search for truth through his poetry writing led to a difficult life, but also helped to produce a remarkable body of work that would influence future generations of American poets to pursue the mysteries of one\u2019s inner self.\r\n\u00a0\r\nRoethke\u2019s awareness evolved at Michigan into a decision to pursue teaching\u2014and poetry\u2014as a career. He earned his BA and MA from the University of Michigan. The fascination with nature he explored so deeply in his later poetry compelled him to write in an undergraduate paper: \u201cWhen I get alone under an open sky where man isn\u2019t too evident\u2014then I\u2019m tremendously exalted and a thousand vivid ideas and sweet visions flood my consciousness.\u201d In addition to the stories, essays, and criticism commonly expected of English students, Roethke began writing poetry at this time. \u201cIf I can\u2019t write, what can I do,\u201d he said, and though Richard Allen Blessing claimed he \u201cwrote a reasonably good prose,\u201d it still would \u201chave taken a keen eye to detect the mature poet beneath the layers of undergraduate baby fat.\u201d The direction towards his eventual career cleared somewhat when Roethke dropped out \u201cin disgust\u201d after a brief stint as a University of Michigan law student: \u201cI didn\u2019t wish to become a defender of property or a corporation lawyer as all my cousins on one side of the family had done.\u201d The attitude evident in this decision supported biographer Allan Seager\u2019s conclusion that it was more than an unsuppressible awareness of life that led him to choose poetry as a career: \u201cIt would be flattering to call it courage; more accurately it seems to have been an angry, defiant, Prussian pigheadedness that was leading him to his decision.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe first 15 years of Roethke\u2019s writing career, from his beginnings as an undergraduate to the publication of Open House, formed a \u201clengthy and painful apprenticeship\u201d for the young writer. During this time, he briefly attended Harvard Law School, where he studied with poet Robert Hillyer, but he abandoned law school due to the Great Depression. In cultivating his poetic expression in the 1930s, Roethke relied heavily upon T.S. Eliot\u2019s belief that \u201cthe only way to manipulate any kind of English verse, [is] by assimilation and imitation.\u201d With this model in mind, Roethke himself once wrote \u201cimitation, conscious imitation, is one of the great methods, perhaps the method of learning to write. ... The final triumph is what the language does, not what the poet can do, or display.\u201d In her book The Echoing Wood of Theodore Roethke, Jenijoy La Belle summarized Roethke\u2019s major challenge as a \u201cconscious imitator\u201d: \u201cThe modern poet should move away from the Romantic concept of personal expression. ... He must, in effect, march through the history of poetry\u2014rewrite the poems of the past\u2014that he may come out at the end of his journey a poet who has absorbed the tradition and who thus may take one step forward and add to that tradition.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nRoethke\u2019s task was no easy one. In addition to debts to such contemporaries as W.H. Auden, Louise Bogan, Babette Deutsch, and William Carlos Williams, his extensive and varied poetic tradition included Wordsworth, Blake, Christopher Smart, Donne, Sir John Davies, Whitman, \u00a0Yeats, Eliot, and Dante.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAlong with these influences, the source of much of Roethke\u2019s poetry was the notebooks he dutifully kept throughout his life. A measure of the devotion given to his craft can be found in his statement \u201cI\u2019m always working,\u201d and indeed his pockets were seemingly always filled with jottings of striking thoughts and conversations. His less spontaneous reflections found a place in the workbench of his poetry\u2014his notebooks. Though Roethke is not generally considered a prolific writer, a more accurate account of the time and effort spent developing his verse is apparent in this extensive accumulation of criticism (of himself and others), abstract thoughts, reflections on childhood, and, of course, poetry. In his biography of Roethke, The Glass House, Allan Seager estimated that only three percent of the lines of poetry in the more than two hundred notebooks was ever published.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe introspective Roethke announced his bold \u201cintention to use himself as the material for his art\u201d through the title of his first published volume, Open House. Not surprisingly, however, the book reflected the imitative and traditional elements of his \u201cconscious imitation\u201d apprenticeship.\r\n\u00a0\r\nRegardless of the limitations evident in Open House, Seager pointed out that \u201cmost of the reviews were good and those that contained adverse criticisms tacitly acknowledged that this was the work of a genuine poet and not a beginner.\u201d Marveling at Roethke\u2019s \u201crare\u201d ability to \u201cremember and to transform the humiliation [\u2018of feeling physically soiled and humiliated by life\u2019] into something beautiful,\u201d Auden called Open House \u201ccompletely successful.\u201d In another review of the book, Elizabeth Drew felt \u201chis poems have a controlled grace of movement and his images the utmost precision; while in the expression of a kind of gnomic wisdom which is peculiar to him as he attains an austerity of contemplation and a pared, spare strictness of language very unusual in poets of today.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nRoethke kept both Auden\u2019s and Drew\u2019s reviews, along with other favorable reactions to his work. As he remained sensitive to how peers and others he respected should view his poetry, so too did he remain sensitive to his introspective drives as the source of his creativity. Understandably, critics picked up on the self as the predominant preoccupation in Roethke\u2019s poems. Others, however, interpreted Roethke\u2019s introspection more positively, claiming it is the essence of his work. Ralph J. Mills called this self-interest \u201cthe primary matter of artistic exploration and knowledge, an interest which endows the poems with a sense of personal urgency, even necessity.\u201d Stanley Poss also heralded Roethke as \u201ca test case of the writer whose interest in himself is so continuous, so relentless, that it transforms itself and becomes in the end centrifugal. With hardly a social or political bone in his body he yet touches all our Ur-selves, our fear and love of our fathers, ... our relish of the lives of plants and animals, our pleasures in women who have more sides than seals, our night fears, our apprehensions of Immanence.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhether this introspection is a weakness or a strength of his poetry, the intensity he devoted to teaching demonstrates an obvious concern outside the self. An immensely popular professor, Roethke succeeded in driving his students to share his enthusiasm for poetry. Not only was he well liked, often extending classroom sessions into the local bar, he was unique, as demonstrated by a popular anecdote from one of his classes at Michigan State University: To stimulate his class in an assignment of the description of physical action, Roethke told his students to describe the act he was about to perform. He then crawled outside through a classroom window and inched himself along the ledge, making faces into each of the surrounding windows.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSuch actions corresponded with what Roethke, a very demanding teacher, expected from his students\u2019 poetry. Oliver Everette recalled him exclaiming, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have rhythm. If you want to dance naked in an open barndoor with a chalk in your navel, I don\u2019t care! You\u2019ve got to have rhythm.\u201d Another student remembered him saying, \u201cPlease let me see evidences of an active mind. Don\u2019t be so guarded\u2014let your mind buzz around.\u201d And, Roethke impressed poet David Wagoner with the line \u201cmotion is equal to emotion.\u201d In addition to Wagoner, Roethke\u2019s best-known students include the poets Richard Hugo, James Wright, Carolyn Kizer, and Jack Gilbert.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThis energetic pursuit of both a teaching and a writing career at times understandably affected his outlook. Part of his frustration stemmed from the amount of time teaching entailed. \u201cI\u2019m teaching well,\u201d he wrote in 1947, \u201c\u2014if I can judge by the response\u2014but haven\u2019t done one damned thing on my own. It\u2019s no way to live\u2014to go from exhaustion to exhaustion.\u201d Later, the fatigue seemed even more crucial to him. \u201cI think I can say there\u2019s a real need for me to get out of teaching for a time,\u201d he wrote William Carlos Williams in 1949. \u201cI\u2019m getting caught up in it: too obsessed with making dents in these little bitches. The best ones keep urging me to quit: not worth it, etc. etc.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nThere were times when Roethke was unable to maintain any semblance of balance. His well-publicized mental breakdowns were, at least in part, the result from his going \u201cfrom exhaustion to exhaustion.\u201d Allan Seager explained the apparent inevitability of first attack (1935): \u201cThere was no great mystery about his going to the hospital\u2014he had nearly ruined himself in a mad attempt to go without sleep, work hard on everything, eat only one or two meals a day because he was so intent on \u2018this experiment\u2019 he was making in his classes.\u201d Roethke himself told Rolfe Humphries (with what Seager noted is a \u201cperfectly rational\u201d explanation) that the reason for his illness, which eventually brought him to the Mercywood Sanitarium in Ann Arbor, \u201cwas his own stupidity in trying to live \u2018a pure and industrious life all of a sudden.\u2019\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nHe suffered a second breakdown ten years later, in 1945, and they became increasingly more frequent in the ensuing decade; by 1958, he was attending therapy sessions six times a week.\r\nDespite his difficulties with mental illness, Roethke remained an invaluable and highly esteemed member of university faculty. Although Seager admitted the cause of Roethke\u2019s problems \u201cmay have lain in the chemistries of his blood and nerves,\u201d some have claimed that they were attributable to his intense self-exploration and that he was able to see into himself more clearly because of his illnesses. Kenneth Burke has shown that by willingly immersing himself in the conflicts of his childhood Roethke precipitated his second breakdown; one psychiatrist has said, \u201cI think his troubles were merely the running expenses he paid for being his kind of poet.\u201d Not denying the personal tragedy of Roethke\u2019s illness, Rosemary Sullivan maintained, \u201che was able to see in his experience a potential insight into other thresholds of consciousness.\u201d These views correspond with Roethke\u2019s premise on the search for truth: \u201cTo go forward (as a spiritual man) it is necessary first to go back.\u201d In The Lost Son (1948) he explored this pattern in the title poem and in its three companion pieces, as Sullivan explained: \u201cThey are desperate poems, each beginning in negative, life-denying solipsism which is gradually and painfully transcended until the poet achieves an exultant experience of wholeness and relation.\u201d In the same vein, Roethke probed the darkness of his childhood in \u201cThe Greenhouse Poems\u201d of The Lost Son.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe roots of the greenhouse sequence lay in the extensive greenhouses owned by Roethke\u2019s father and uncle. For Roethke, whom Seager described as \u201cthin, undersized and sickly as a boy, obviously intelligent but shy and diffident as well,\u201d the greenhouses became a source of ambivalence: \u201cThey were to me, I realize now, both heaven and hell, a kind of tropics created in the savage climate of Michigan, where austere German Americans turned their love of order and their terrifying efficiency into something beautiful.\u201d Associated with the greenhouse in measuring the effects of childhood was his father, a German American, who died when Roethke was 14. Sullivan explained the paradoxical father-son relationship: \u201cOtto Roethke presented an exterior of authoritarian order and discipline [but] in the greenhouse he gave expression to a deep sensitivity to the beauty of nature.\u201d The apparent tendency of Otto to hide this \u201cvulnerable core,\u201d Sullivan added, prevented Roethke from understanding his father. Feeling \u201cangered and abandoned,\u201d Roethke implicated himself in his father\u2019s death, a death that prevented any gradual reconciliation between them. Sullivan further theorized that \u201cfrom the consequent sense of his own inadequacy Roethke seems to have acquired the burdens of fears and guilts which haunted him all his life.\u201d Certainly his writings\u2014from essays written at the University of Michigan to the poem \u201cOtto\u201d in The Far Field\u2014uphold Seager\u2019s comment that \u201call his life the memory loomed over him.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nBy scrutinizing the plants, flowers, and creatures, Roethke attempted to tie the world of the greenhouse to the \u201cinner world\u201d of man. \u201cThe sensual world of the greenhouse is the first garden from which we have all emerged,\u201d explained Richard Blessing, \u201cand the attempt to make meaning of it, to recall the energies of that place occupies us all in the lonely chill of our adult beds.\u201d James G. Southworth agreed that the search through the past is a painful one, as demonstrated in the opening lines of \u201cCuttings (later)\u201d: \u201cThis urge, wrestle, resurrection of dry sticks, / Cut stems struggling to put down feet, / What saint strained so much, / Rose on such lopped limbs to new life?\u201d Ultimately the message spelled from the greenhouse sequence, as interpreted by Blessing, \u201creads that life is dynamic, not static; that the energy of the moment from the past preserves it, in part, in the present; that experience is a continuum, not a collection of dead instant preserved and pinned on walls we have left behind.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhile The Lost Son focused on a child\u2019s struggle for identity, Roethke made great advances in establishing his own identity as a poet during this time. Michael Harrington felt \u201cRoethke found his own voice and central themes in The Lost Son\u201d and Stanley Kunitz saw a \u201cconfirmation that he was in full possession of his art and of his vision.\u201d Blessing echoed this praise when he wrote: \u201cTo my mind, the transformation of Theodore Roethke from a poet of \u2018lyric resourcefulness, technical proficiency and ordered sensibility\u2019 to a poet of \u2018indomitable creativeness and audacity ... difficult, heroic, moving and profoundly disquieting\u2019 is one of the most remarkable in American literary history.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nRoethke\u2019s next book of poetry, Praise to the End! (1951), followed much the same pattern set in The Lost Son by continuing \u201chis most heroic enterprise,\u201d the sequence of interior monologues initiated in the title poem of The Lost Son. Roethke himself offered these suggestions on how to read the new book: \u201cYou will have no trouble if you approach these poems as a child would, naively, with your whole being awake, your faculties loose and alert. (A large order, I daresay!) Listen to them, for they are written to be heard, with the themes often coming alternately, as in music, and usually a partial resolution at the end. Each poem ... is complete in itself; yet each in a sense is a stage in a kind of struggle out of the slime; part of a slow spiritual progress; an effort to be born, and later, to become something more.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAfter the intense explorations of The Lost Son and Praise to the End! \u201cit is not surprising,\u201d as W.D. Snodgrass pointed out, \u201cthat Roethke might at this point need to step back and regather his forces. He did just that in the group of \u2018New Poems\u2019 in The Waking (1954).\u201d This next book of Roethke\u2019s won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, and has long since been considered one of the most important books of contemporary American poetry. The title poem, \u201cThe Waking,\u201d has been one of the most anthologized American poems of the 20th-century.\r\n\u00a0\r\nRoethke\u2019s marriage, his readings in philosophy and religion, and his feelings of anxiety and illness are, according to Malkoff, the most important events projected in the \u201cNew Poems\u201d of Words for the Wind. His love poems, which first appeared in The Waking, earned their own section in the new book, \u201cwere a distinct departure from the painful excavations of the monologues and in some respects a return to the strict stanzaic forms of the earliest work,\u201d said Stanley Kunitz. Ralph Mills described \u201cthe amatory verse\u201d as a blend of \u201cconsideration of self with qualities of eroticism and sensuality; but more important, the poems introduce and maintain a fascination with something beyond the self, that is, with the figure of the other, or the beloved woman.\u201d Roethke\u2019s \u201csurrender to sensualism,\u201d claimed Robert Boyers, is not permanent: \u201cHe eventually discovers that the love of woman is not the ultimate mode for him.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAs Malkoff noted, Roethke is not a thoroughly consistent poet. \u201cHe moves from utter despair, to resignation, to mystic faith beyond mysticism and back to despair. We shall not find in his poems the development of a systematic philosophy; there emerges rather the complex figure of a man directly confronting the limitations of his existence with none of life\u2019s possibilities ... excluded.\u201d Words for the Wind wavers in this way when, in Kunitz\u2019s words, \u201cthe love poems gradually dissolve into the death poems.\u201d The book does conclude with \u201cThe Dying Man\u201d and \u201cMeditations of an Old Woman,\u201d but these poems are more than gloomy contemplations of death: Blessing believed \u201cThe Dying Man\u201d (dedicated to Roethke\u2019s spiritual father, Yeats) \u201cremains a poem about the creative possibilities inherent in the very shapelessness of death\u201d; Malkoff thought \u201cMeditations of an Old Woman\u201d \u201cprovides a kind of frame of reference for the consideration of life, and which often reappearing, is never far from the poem\u2019s surface. ... [Ultimately,] Words for the Wind, read from cover to cover, is the spiritual autobiography of a man whose excessive sensitivity to his experience magnifies rather than distorts man\u2019s universal condition.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nRoethke earned much of this magnified vision with an understanding of the mysticism that pervades Words for the Wind (1958) and The Far Field (1964), which both won the National Book Award for Poetry. Heavily influenced by Evelyn Underhill\u2019s Mysticism, many of his later poems follow her psychological progression, as outlined by Sullivan: \u201cThey begin with the painful apprehension of personal insufficiency, aggravated by the awareness of the possibility of a deeper reality. This is followed by a desire for purification through self-castigation and mortification, which Underhill calls the painful descent into the \u2018cell of knowledge.\u2019 This leads to illumination, a sudden breakthrough to a heightened visionary joy in the awakening of transcendental consciousness. These are only the first three, as it were, secular stages of mystical insight; he never laid claim to the last stages which lead to union with Absolute Being.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nWilliam Heyen emphasized that Roethke was not one who dedicated \u201chis life to educating himself to achieve union with God. Rather, Roethke was an artist who experienced moments of deep religious feeling and almost inexpressible illumination. His choice was not traditional Christianity or atheism, but a reliance upon the mystic perceptions of his own imagination.\u201d In Sequence, Sometimes Metaphysical, for example, Roethke defined his focus as \u201ca hunt, a drive toward God; an effort to break through the barrier of rational experience.\u201d McMichael, however, found a paradox involved in such an effort: \u201cThe more he thinks about that thing [something other than himself] the less likely he is to know it as it really is; for as soon as he begins to acquire for him any of the qualities that his conceptual faculty is ready to impose upon it, his intuition and love of it are lost.\u201d Roethke does reach points of ecstasy in his poems, though, and Heyen defended him against critics who have charged that his joy is superficial and too easily attained: \u201cIt is important to realize that the happiness achieved in any Roethke poem ... is not one based on reason. ... Armed with his study of Underhill and the mystics she discusses Roethke has found his rationale ... he can rock irrationally between light and dark, can go by feeling where he has to go.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAdmittedly in retrospect, Seager reflected on the years preceding The Far Field and Roethke\u2019s death in 1963: \u201cThe last years of Ted\u2019s life, as we look back on them knowing they were the last, seem to have a strange air of unconscious preparation. As the fabric of his body begins to give way, the best part of his mind, his poetry, ... strives toward a mystical union with his Father. But this was unconscious. I don\u2019t think he was at all aware that he was getting ready to go. He had too much work in hand, too much projected, yet the last poems seem prophetic: they read like last poems.\u201d Perceiving a similar pattern in The Far Field, W.D. Snodgrass wrote that \u201cthese poems, recording that withdrawal [as in \u2018The Longing\u2019], also, I think suffer from it. The language grows imprecise with pain. ... Metrically, too, one has a sense of discouragement and withdrawal. ... More and more, Roethke\u2019s late poems seem to have lost their appetite, their tolerance for that anguish of concreteness.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\nThe Far Field, which won the National Book Award in 1965, contained two sequences representing earlier themes and images, as well as \u201cNorth American Sequence\u201d and Sequence, Sometimes Metaphysical. According to Sullivan, Roethke wished to be remembered by the last poems in the latter sequence. Roethke himself wrote that \u201cin spite of all the muck and welter, the dreck of these poems [in Sequence, Sometimes Metaphysical], I count myself among the happy poets: I proclaim once more a condition of joy.\u201d Indeed for those distressed by the tragic self-implications of his statement\u2014\u201dThere is nothing more disconcerting than when a rich nature thins into despair\u201d\u2014these last poems, in celebrating the richness of nature and the poet\u2019s \u201ccapacity to face up to genuine mystery,\u201d erase the despair. His last lines read: \u201cAnd everything comes to One, / As we dance on, dance on, dance on.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nRoethke\u2019s death in 1963, of a heart attack while swimming in a friend\u2019s pool, was \u201can incalculable loss to American Literature,\u201d wrote Ralph Mills. While the poet was drinking much and suffering in his later years from a combination of ailments, including arthritis, bursitis, and periods of manic excitement, his poetry was reaching its peak and earned this praise from James Dickey: \u201cRoethke seems to me the finest poet now writing in English. I[say] this with a certain fierceness, knowing that I have to put him up against Eliot, Pound, Graves, and a good many others of high rank. I do it cheerfully, however. ... I think Roethke is the finest poet not so much because of his beautifully personal sense of form ... but because of the way he sees and feels the aspects of life which are compelling to him.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe publication of Collected Poems in 1966 brought renewed interest in Roethke and prompted illuminating overviews of his work. David Ferry felt \u201chis seriousness is frequently too solemnly serious, his lyrical qualities too lyrically lyrical. His mystical vein often seems willed, forced. ... And yet Roethke is a very interesting and important poet. For one thing there is ... the brilliance there [in Praise to the End!] with which he uses imitations of children\u2019s voices, nursery rhymes, his beautiful sense of the lives of small creatures, the shifting rhythms and stanza forms. ... [And, in The Far Field] there are signs ... of a new and promising expansiveness and tentativeness. ... For the reader, the pity is not to be able to see where this would have taken him.\u201d Karl Malkoff wrote, \u201cThough not definite, Roethke: Collected Poems is a major book of poetry. It reveals the full extent of Roethke\u2019s achievement: his ability to perceive reality in terms of the tensions between inner and outer worlds, and to find a meaningful system of metaphor with which to communicate this perception. \u2026 He is one of our finest poets, a human poet in a world that threatens to turn man into an object.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nRoethke was altogether human, both in creating \u201cthe most exhaustive, vital, and vivid reports\u201d we have of a soul in the several agonies normally recorded in one human life,\u201d and in impressing \u201chis friends and readers profoundly as a human being.\u201d His appreciation for all life is evident in his statement, \u201cIf I have a complex, it\u2019s a full-life complex.\u201d Roethke lived energetically, most notably through a devotion to his teaching and through the introspection necessary to his poetry. At the same time, it is generally acknowledged that he paid for his tremendous mental and physical energy with his breakdowns. Thus, as Snodgrass said, one can view Roethke\u2019s career \u201cwith an astonished awe, yet with sadness.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
