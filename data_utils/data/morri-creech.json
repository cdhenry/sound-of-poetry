His formal poems engage human questions within a framework of biblical and mythical allusion. A reviewer for\u00a0Library Journal\u00a0praises Creech\u2019s \u201csense of pacing and musicality,\u201d observing that in\u00a0The Sleep of Reason, Creech \u201cturn[s] over hard questions as he registers frustration with the human detritus of banks, businesses, and weapons of war, but he finally comes back to the surety and beauty of the universe.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nCreech\u2019s collections include\u00a0The Sleep of Reason\u00a0(2013), the Anthony Hecht Poetry Prize\u2013winning\u00a0Field Knowledge\u00a0(2006), and the Stan and Tom Wick Poetry Prize\u2013winning\u00a0Paper Cathedrals\u00a0(2001). His work has been featured in\u00a0Poetry: A Pocket Anthology\u00a0(2005, 4th edition, edited by R.S. Gwynn) and\u00a0The Swallow Anthology of New American Poets\u00a0(2009, edited by David Yezzi).\r\n\u00a0\r\nCreech\u2019s honors include a Ruth Lilly Fellowship, a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship, grants from the Louisiana Division of the Arts and the North Carolina Arts Council, and a\u00a0Southwest Review\u00a0Elizabeth Matchett Stover Memorial Award.
