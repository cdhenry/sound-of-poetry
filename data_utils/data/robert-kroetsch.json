His novels, poems, and criticism articulated a postmodern, experimental vision of Canadian literature during the 1960s and 1970s. Based in the western prairies of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, Kroetsch helped found literary journals\u2014including the influential Boundary 2: A Journal of Postmodern Literature\u2014presses, and reading series and mentored a generation of Canadian writers during his tenure at the University of Manitoba.  \u00a0 Kroetsch was born in Heisler, Alberta, in 1927 and earned degrees at the University of Manitoba, Middlebury College, and the University of Iowa. He set many of his novels on the prairies where he had grown up, including Words of My Roaring (1966); The Studhorse Man (1969), which won a Canadian Governor General\u2019s award; and Gone Indian (1973). His nine novels, which blend myth, magical realism, and postmodern play, are landmarks in Canadian literature. \u00a0 Kroetsch also published 14 collections of poetry. According to poet and critic Robert Archambeau, Kroetsch\u2019s work provides \u201ca kind of constant, amused intellectual probing of the everyday.\u201d In many of his long poems, such as Seed Catalogue (1986) and The Ledger (1975), Kroetsch experimented with found texts and procedural writing. He played with constraints\u2014in his long poem The Sad Phoenician (1979), all the lines begin with and or but\u2014as well as fragments and serial writing. Other books of poetry include Too Bad (2010), The Hornbooks of Rita K (2001), and Completed Field Notes: The Long Poems of Robert Kroetsch (1989), a collection that brings together all of Kroetsch\u2019s long poems.  \u00a0 When Kroetsch was killed in a car accident in 2011, there was an outpouring of tributes from friends and former students. Writers such as Archambeau, Rudy Wiebe, Aritha van Herk, and Michael Ondaatje all spoke of Kroetsch\u2019s generosity and genius. According to Ondaatje, \u201cHe was life-force. I can think of no one else like him.\" Each year Snare Press grants the Kroetsch Award for Innovative Poetry in his honor.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Canada"]}}
