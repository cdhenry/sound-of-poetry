His first book, Bent To Earth, a 2006 National Book Critics Circle finalist, reflects on those experiences. Claire Dederer in Poetry noted, \u201cThe immigrant labor experience permeates De Luna\u2019s spare, forthright poetry, from his depictions of border crossings and INS beatings to his evocation of \u2018bitter dust\u2019 and carefully tended tomato plants.\u201d\u00a0 With \u201chome\u201d and \u201cits life of rural, working poverty\u201d as his major themes, Dederer observes that De Luna \u201clays bare the dear costs and secret truths of such poverty, often in just a few sharp images.\u201d\nIn the same Poetry profile, De Luna comments on the autobiographical tone of his poems, stating, \u201cI\u2019m not by nature the kind of person who reveals himself, but it just kind of happens in the poems\u2014the willingness to go to the place where you\u2019re revealed, but always in service of the poem, never in a purging kind of way.\nA writer of both fiction and poetry, De Luna earned a BA and MA from California State University, Fresno, and an MFA from the University of Washington. He was the Ruth and Jay C. Halls Poetry Fellow at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. His poems have been anthologized in How Much Earth: An Anthology of Fresno Poets\u00a0(2001) and Highway 99: A Literary Journey Through California\u2019s Great Central Valley (1996). A 1998 Artist Trust / Washington State Art Commission Literature Fellow, he teaches high school English in California.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
