Rivers grew up in Chicago and was educated at the University of the Americas in Mexico City. Rivers\u2019s poems often return to one of several sources: his youth in Chicago, Mexican history and culture, the personas of \u201cCulpepper\u201d and \u201cEsterhazy,\u201d and the history of World War II. Blending historical and cultural fact with the surreal, his poems frequently explore themes of justice and loss. \u201cJames W. Rivers is a poet whose keen psychological insights pierce straight to the marrow of human experience. The poems in this final collection, assembled and edited by Rivers shortly before his death, expand on themes that have concerned him throughout his writing life: courage and fortitude in the face of adversity, the enormity of coping with personal loss, and the ironies inherent in the perceptions of reality by divergent worldviews,\u201d observed Robert D. Sutherland of the poems in Rivers\u2019s chapbook From the House of War. \u00a0 Rivers published four full-length collections of poetry during his lifetime: From the Chicago Notebook: Memories of the South Side (1979); Proud and On My Feet (1983); which was chosen for the University of Georgia Contemporary Poetry Series by Mona Van Duyn; When the Owl Cries, Indians Die: Poems of Mexico and the Southwest (1986); and The Lady in Once-White Shoes: Poems of the Colonial Frontier (1989).
