He lived in Berlin for a couple of years, moved to France in 1982, and has taught at universities in the United States, including the University of Houston and the University of Chicago. Zagajewski writes in Polish; many of his books of poetry and essays have been translated into English.  Zagajewski was considered one of the \u201cGeneration of \u201968\u201d or \u201cNew Wave\u201d writers in Poland; his early work was protest poetry, though he has moved away from that emphasis in his later work. The reviewer Joachim T. Baer noted in World Literature Today that Zagajewski\u2019s themes \u201care the night, dreams, history and time, infinity and eternity, silence and death.\u201d The titles of his collections of poetry suggest some of these concerns: Tremor (1985), Mysticism for Beginners (1997), and World Without End: New and Selected Poems (2002).  Writing of Zagajewski\u2019s 1991 collection of poems, Canvas, poet and reviewer Robert Pinsky commented that the poems are \u201cabout the presence of the past in ordinary life: history not as chronicle of the dead, or an anima to be illuminated by some doctrine, but as an immense, sometimes subtle force inhering in what people see and feel every day\u2014and in the ways we see and feel.\u201d  Zagajewski\u2019s prose collections include Two Cities: On Exile, History and the Imagination (1995) and the 2000 memoir Another Beauty. Zagajewski has won the Prix de la Libert\u00e9 as well as fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the Berliner Kunstleprogramm.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Poland"]}}
