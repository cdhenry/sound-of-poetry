After briefly coediting the magazine Vice Versa with classmate and fellow dropout Harry Brown in New York City, Thompson joined the U.S. Army in 1942. During the war, Thompson published his first book, Poems (1942), which received acclaim. His other books include including Laments for the Sleepwalkers (1946), the travel book The Phoenix in the Desert (1951), and the novel The Dove with the Bough of Olive (1954). After the war, Thompson settled in the UK with his partner and died in 1975.\nAfter publishing relatively little in his lifetime, Thompson has received much posthumous attention for balancing his Catholic and homosexual identities. Poet D.A. Powell has called Thompson an \u201cAmerican master\u201d and poet-critic Dana Gioia wrote that Thompson was \u201cone of the first poets\u2014and certainly the best of the World War era\u2014to write openly about homosexual experience.\u201d\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
