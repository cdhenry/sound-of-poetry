Carroll revised a diary he kept as a teenage years into his most famous literary work, The Basketball Diaries (1978), which chronicles Carroll\u2019s double life as a star student and basketball player and who also happened to be a junkie, hustling gay men to support his drug habit. At fifteen Carroll started writing poetry, and at sixteen published his first book of poems, Organic Trains (1967); he went on to publish five more books of poetry, including The Living At The Movies (1973), Book of Nods (1986), and Fear of Dreaming (1993).\nAlso a musician and song writer, Carroll formed the Jim Carroll Band; their album Catholic Boy is considered a significant punk record with its hit single \"People Who Died.\" In 1995 a film version of The Basketball Diaries was released starring Leonardo DiCaprio, and in 2002-2003 Carroll recorded three spoken word albums, including a reading of Jack Kerouac\u2019s Doctor Sax and the Great World Snake and William Blake\u2019s The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.
