The son of Eastern European immigrants, Stern\u2019s poetry frequently references his all-American, working-class upbringing as well as his Jewish and Eastern European heritage. Cosmopolitan, even international in scope, and yet deeply personal, Stern\u2019s work is known for its passionate defense of human emotions and needs. According to Jeffrey Dodd, Elise Gregory, and Adam O\u2019Connor Rodriguez, all of whom interviewed Stern for the journal Willow Springs: \u201cHis work derides provincialism and points to a world of experiences beyond American borders and transcendent of temporal limits. Stern has lived in this rich world, and his poetry calls attention to its failures, beauties, and curiosities without fear, shame or sentimentality.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nThough Stern has declared himself \u201cnot really an internationalist,\u201d he does identify with Eastern European poets. In his Willow Springs interview, Stern said: \u201cMy family\u2019s only been here for 100 years. Exactly 100 years. And I grew up in Pittsburgh, American-raised, whatever the hell that means\u2014to be American. But I realize now I\u2019m somewhat of a foreigner.\u201d That sense of foreignness and outsider status has permeated both Stern\u2019s work and his career. Though good friends with poets like Jack Gilbert, who enjoyed early success, Stern was over 50 when his first book to receive critical attention was published. His second poetry collection, Lucky Life (1977), was the Lamont Poetry Selection of the Academy of American Poets and nominated for a National Book Award. His next, The Red Coal (1981), received the Melville Caine Award from the Poetry Society of American. Subsequent collections include Leaving Another Kingdom: Selected Poems (1990); Bread Without Sugar (1992), winner of the Paterson Prize; This Time: New and Selected Poems (1998), which won the National Book Award; Last Blue (2002); American Sonnets (2002); Everything is Burning (2005); Save the Last Dance (2008);\u00a0\u00a0Early Collected Poems: 1965\u20131992 (2010), a volume collecting six of Stern\u2019s earliest books; Galaxy Love\u00a0(2017); and Blessed As We Were: Late Selected & New\u00a0(2020). Stern has also written two collections of essays, including the autobiographical What I Can\u2019t Bear Losing: Notes from a Life (2004; 2009).\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nStern taught for many years at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. He has also held positions at Temple University, New England College\u2014where he co-founded the Masters of Fine Arts in Poetry\u2014and Drew University. Stern is proud of his checkered career within academia: \u201cMyself, I floundered in my twenties,\u201d he told Adrienne Davich in an interview for The Rumpus. \u201cThough I wore a long scarf. And when I got to be thirty I got a job at Temple University in Philadelphia. I worked there for seven years, and I finally got fired, mostly for political reasons\u2026 the institution subtly and insidiously works on you in such a way that though you seem to have freedom you become a servant. Your main issue is to get promoted to the next thing. Or get invited to a picnic. Or get tenure. Or get laid.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nStern\u2019s many awards and honors include the Wallace Stevens Award, the Bess Hokin Award, the Ruth Lilly Prize, the Bernard F. Conners Award from the Paris Review, and the Pennsylvania Governor\u2019s Award for Excellence in the Arts. He has received fellowships from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Guggenheim Foundation. He was Poet Laureate of New Jersey from 2000\u20132002. More than one critic has compared Stern to Walt Whitman, but Southern Review writer Kate Daniels articulated a different perspective: \u201cWe might like to think of [Stern] as our quintessentially Whitmanian American poet,\u201d Daniels has stated, \u201cbut he is far too literate, too worldly to seem typically American. Perhaps it would be more accurate to think of him as a post-nuclear, multicultural Whitman for the millennium\u2014the U.S.'s one and only truly global poet.\u201d\n", "attrs": {}}
