Hearon\u2019s lyric, sometimes formal poems are rich with allusion and historical reference even as they engage contemporary culture. In a 2007 interview for the Exeter Bulletin, Hearon noted, \u201cI have been faced with the new artistic problem (new for me, not for art) of how to find a place in my poems for the ugly, the treacherous, the false, the banal\u2014things that have always, of course, been there, but that seemed to have floated to the surface of my consciousness, stayed put, and sought expression.\u201d\nHis poetry collection Strange Land (2010) was selected by poet Natasha Trethewey as a winner of the Crab Orchard Poetry Series in Poetry Open Competition Award. Hearon is the recipient of a PEN New England Discovery Award and a Friends of Literature Prize from Poetry magazine.
