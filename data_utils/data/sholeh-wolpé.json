She earned an MA in radio, television, and film from Northwestern University, as well as a master of health sciences degree from Johns Hopkins University.\u00a0\nWolp\u00e9 discussed the source of her poetry in a 2005 interview: \u201cThe universe is one long poem. I think some of us just tap into that poem and snatch little pieces of it and translate it into words. Every poem is a translation of this sort.\u201d Wolp\u00e9\u2019s concise, unflinching, and often wry free verse explores violence, culture, and gender. \u201cSo many of Wolp\u00e9's poems deal with the violent situation in the Middle East, yet she is ready to both bravely and playfully refuse to let death be too proud,\u201d observed Joe Benevento in a review of The Scar Saloon (2004) for Green Hills Literary Lantern.\nWolp\u00e9 is the author of the chapbook The Outsider (2018) and several collections of poetry, including\u00a0C\u00f3mo escribir una canci\u00f3n de amor (2017), Keeping Time with Blue Hyacinths\u00a0(2013), Rooftops of Tehran\u00a0(2008), and\u00a0The Scar Saloon\u00a0(2004). She translated Attar\u2019s The Conference of the Birds, for which she received a PEN/Heim translation grant,\u00a0and\u00a0Sin: Selected Poems of Forugh Farrokhzad\u00a0(2007), which won the Lois Roth Persian Translation Award, among other works. She has also written plays and edited anthologies, including Breaking the Jaws of Silence: Sixty Americans Poets Speak to the World (2012)\u00a0and The Forbidden: Poems from Iran and Its Exiles (2012), which was awarded the Midwest Book Award. Wolp\u00e9\u2019s 2010 Iran issue of the\u00a0Atlanta Review\u00a0became that journal\u2019s bestselling issue. She is also a regional editor for the Iran section of\u00a0Tablet & Pen: Literary Landscapes from the Modern Middle East\u00a0(2010), and her Persian co-translation of Walt Whitman\u2019s\u00a0Song of Myself, commissioned by the International Program at the University of Iowa, was published on Whitman Web, and will be published in Iran.\nHer work has been translated into several languages and included in numerous anthologies, such as\u00a0Language for a New Century: Contemporary Poetry from the Middle East, Asia, and Beyond\u00a0(2008) and\u00a0Yellow as Turmeric, Fragrant as Cloves: An Anthology of Asian American Female Poets\u00a0(2008),\u00a0PowWow: Charting the Faultlines in the American Experience\u2014Fiction from Then to Now\u00a0(2009), and\u00a0Tremors: New Fiction by Iranian American Writers\u00a0(2009). Wolp\u00e9\u2019s poetry has been nominated several times for the Pushcart Prize, and in 2005 she received an Artists Embassy International\u2019s Peace through the Arts award.\nWolp\u00e9\u00a0has taught poetry and literary translation at Stonecoast's MFA program\u00a0and\u00a0the University of Southern California. She has performed her work at numerous\u00a0venues, including Broad Stage, the Skirball Cultural Center Series, and the Dodge Poetry Festival; and sponsored international programs such as\u00a0Same Gate in Turkey. She lives in Los Angeles.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
