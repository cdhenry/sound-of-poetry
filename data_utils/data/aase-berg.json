She is also the author of two books of criticism, a YA novel, and, most recently, the novel\u00a0Haggan (2019). Poet Johannes G\u00f6ransson has translated six of Berg\u2019s books into English:\u00a0Remainland: Selected Poems\u00a0(2004),\u00a0With Deer\u00a0(2009),\u00a0Transfer Fat\u00a0(2012), Dark Matter\u00a0(2013),\u00a0Hackers (2015), and the essay collection A Tsunami from Solaris (2019), with Joyelle McSweeney. Berg's\u00a0writings have\u00a0been translated into numerous other languages.\nBerg\u2019s work is known for its dense and speculative imagery, linguistic deformation and play, and gothic or post-human sensibility. Berg describes her first books, which utilized the form of the prose poem, as \u201cwaking dreams or\u00a0hallies\u00a0[hallucinations],\u201d adding \u201cthe things I wanted to show were accompanied by a pounding rhythm. And they were almost sickeningly kitschy. The rhythmic and screamily exaggerated word-images gave birth to the form.\u201d Berg\u2019s later work utilizes shorter lines. She says of her relationship to language, \u201cLanguage forces one to be a human on conditions one may not enjoy, forces one to accept reason, causality and chronology as main elements, not as choices. Following hand in hand with the surprise at the possibilities of language comes the hatred of language, and the demand for a new, more human language: a language that looks like us, instead of trying to discipline us.\u201d\nBerg\u2019s writing on literature and culture has appeared widely in Sweden, and she was awarded the Dagens Nyheter\u2019s Lagercrantzen for her criticism. She is also a recipient of the prestigious Aftonbladets Litteraturpris.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Scandinavia"]}}
