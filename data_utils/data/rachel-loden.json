After her parents\u2019 divorce, her mother was hospitalized for schizophrenia, and Loden and her brother spent time in foster care. As a teenager, she discovered Donald Allen\u2019s influential anthology The New American Poetry (1945\u20131960), and from there began to immerse herself in poetry, finding influences in Emily Dickinson, Franz Kafka, and John Ashbery. She\u00a0attended seminal events such as the Berkeley Poetry Conference in 1965; her book\u00a0Kulchur Girl (2014) collects her notes and diary entries about this conference.\u00a0\u00a0 Loden\u2019s collections of poetry include Dick of the Dead (2009), a finalist for the PEN USA Literary Award for Poetry and the California Book Award, and Hotel Imperium (2008), winner of the Contemporary Poetry Series competition and selected as one of the top 10 poetry books of the year by the San Francisco Chronicle. Both books offer extended poems about former president Richard Nixon, who was a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee that blacklisted Loden\u2019s father, an actor and radio announcer. Weaving together sharp wit and serious music, Loden\u2019s work contains layers of personal, cultural, and political history. \u00a0 In a 2009 review of Dick of the Dead for the Rumpus, poet D.A. Powell noted that Loden\u2019s \u201cNixon is a fallen monument, an apparition who stalks the grounds of the White [H]ouse; who sits with his head \u2018like a Rushmore in space\u2019 awaiting his ultimate pardon.\u201d In an interview for the same piece, Loden offered a realization she had while preparing the proofs of Dick of the Dead: \u201cWhat hit me was what should have been obvious all along: I am Nixon. I am my Nixon, anyway. I am most avidly interested in not dying.\u201d \u00a0 Loden\u2019s honors include a fellowship from the California Arts Council, a grant from the Fund for Poetry, an &NOW award, and a Pushcart Prize. Her poems have been included in two editions of Best American Poetry and in Western Wind: An Introduction to Poetry (2005). \n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
