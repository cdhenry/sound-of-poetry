She earned a BA from Creighton University and an MA from San Francisco State University. Since 1993 she has taught at the University of Southern California, where she founded the PhD in creative writing and literature program. A former poet laureate of California, she is the author of the poetry collections Blue Rose (2018);\u00a0Twin Cities (2011);\u00a0Sparrow (2003), which was a National Book Award finalist;\u00a0An Octave Above Thunder: New and Selected Poems (1997);\u00a0Applause (1989);\u00a0and Camouflage (1975). She has won numerous awards for her work, including the Alice Fay Di Castagnola Award, an Ingram-Merrill grant, several Pushcart Prizes, and a Witter/Bynner Award from the Library of Congress. She has received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation.\nIn addition to poetry, Muske-Dukes has published two collections of essays, including Married to the Ice Pick Killer: A Poet in Hollywood (2002), which humorously and insightfully describes her encounters with Hollywood following her marriage to the actor David Coleman Dukes. With Bob Holman, she co-edited the anthology Crossing State Lines: An American Renga (2011), and with Diana Arterian, she coedited The Magical Poetry Blimp Pilot\u2019s Guide (2011), a handbook designed to help students read, memorize, and love poetry. Muske-Dukes has also written novels, including Dear Digby (2014), Saving St. Germ (2014), Life after Death (2001), and Channeling Mark Twain (2007). Known for her sharp portraiture and strong imagery, Muske-Dukes drew on her own experiences teaching in a women\u2019s prison for the bestselling Channeling Mark Twain. In 1972, she created Free Space, a creative writing program at the Women\u2019s House of Detention on Riker\u2019s Island.\nA careful writer who balances rhetorical precision with a unique manner of relating personal experience, Muske-Dukes has discovered, in the words of one critic, how to \u201creach past anecdote.\u201d Writing in Contemporary Women Poets, essayist Duane Ackerson noted of Muske-Dukes\u2019 verse that, \u201cwhile well-anchored in daily life, [it] moves far beyond to become a meditation on philosophical concerns like the nature of time and the value of life. This carefully achieved scope contributes much of what is powerful and persuasive in her work.\u201d Muske-Dukes published her first story at age 11 and began writing poetry at an even earlier age. \u201cBut I was fairly unconscious about the power of words and what it meant to have the power to use them until I came to New York in 1971,\u201d she explained to Contemporary Authors. After becoming involved in several writing workshops, including Free Space, she \u201cbegan to hear the dialogue between craft and sentiment, form and feeling.\u201d Still she considers herself to be primarily a visual poet: \u201cimages come ... easily to me, imagistic phrases litter my poems. I feel very close to painters, our processes are similar.\u201d\nThe difference between \u201cseeing\u201d and \u201chearing\u201d her writing is one of the distinctions Muske-Dukes finds between her poetry and her prose. \u201cThe problem for me is \u2018hearing\u2019 what I write\u2014that\u2019s why it was so refreshing for me to write [my first novel]. I found a voice, I trusted it, I let it speak. Beyond time and how time happens in a poem or a story, the relationship between eye and ear forms the difference for me between poetry and prose. In prose, the reader listens, the reader is being told a story, she hears, then sees\u2014in poems, the reader sees aurally, the eye and ear become one.\u201d With the same precision that she composes her poetry, Muske-Dukes extracts real meaning from the images created by the words in each of her novels, and her wide variety of subjects demonstrate her broad learning and interests. \u201cAs many writers have said before me,\u201d she told Contemporary Authors, \u201cI didn\u2019t choose my subjects, they chose me. I was \u2018given\u2019 a set of themes early in life and they\u2019ve obsessed me and continue to do so.\u201d\nCarol Muske-Dukes writes regularly for the New York Times Book Review and the Los Angeles Times Book Review. She lives in Los Angeles.\n", "attrs": {}}
