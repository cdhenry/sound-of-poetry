During childhood, he was in and out of hospitals as doctors attempted to remedy a condition in which one leg grew faster than the other. His experiences with the medical establishment and its culture became important to his work as a poet and a scholar; he holds the Ability Center of Greater Toledo Endowed Chair of Disability Studies at the University of Toledo. His groundbreaking essay \u201cThe Enjambed Body: A Step Toward a Crippled Poetics\u201d appeared in the Georgia Review.  Ferris\u2019s first book of poems, The Hospital Poems (2004), won the Main Street Rag Poetry Book Award. Ferris himself has called it a \u201cmemoir in verse,\u201d but Edward Hirsch, the contest\u2019s judge, noted that the collection \u201ccrosses a divide and reaches out to the crippled and disabled, to what is sick, wounded, and orphaned in us.\u201d Ferris\u2019s other books include the chapbook Facts of Life (2005) and Slouching Towards Guantanamo (Main Street Rag, 2011). He holds a doctorate in performance studies and has performed his own work widely.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
