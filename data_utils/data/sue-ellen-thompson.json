Her two other books, The Leaving: New & Selected Poems (2001) and The Golden Hour (2005), were nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Known for her elegant control of form, Thompson\u2019s poetry has been praised for its metaphorical heft and sinuous syntax. Poet B.H. Fairchild praised The Golden Hour for its \u201celegant, wild, beautifully disciplined quatrains and casually rhymed sonnets.\u201d She is also the editor of The Autumn House Anthology of Contemporary American Poetry (2005).\n\u00a0Thompson has received numerous awards and honors, including the Samuel French Morse Prize, the Pablo Neruda Prize, the Maryland Author Award, and two Artist Fellowships from the Connecticut Commission on Culture & Tourism. She has taught at Middlebury College, Wesleyan University, Binghamton University (SUNY), and Central Connecticut State University. She currently works at The Writer\u2019s Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and tutors adult poets.\n\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
