She is the author of several critically acclaimed books of poetry, including Abacus (1987; reprinted 2007), The Devil\u2019s Tour (1993), Viper Rum (2001), Sinners Welcome (2006), and Tropic of Squalor (2018), a trilogy of memoirs including The Liar\u2019s Club (1995), Cherry (2001), and Lit (2009), and The Art of Memoir (2015). Karr\u2019s poetry and prose frequently include autobiographical elements, including her hardscrabble childhood, teenage drug-use, failed marriage and adult alcoholism, as well as her subsequent recovery and conversion to Catholicism. Yet despite the brutality of much of her subject matter, Karr\u2019s work has received tremendous praise for its lyricism and beauty. Reviewing the breakthrough memoir, The Liars\u2019 Club, in the New York Times, Michiko Kakutani noted that Karr\u2019s \u201cmost powerful tool is her language, which she wields with the virtuosity of both a lyric poet and an earthy, down-home Texan. It\u2019s a skill used\u2026 in the service of a wonderfully unsentimental vision that redeems the past even as it recaptures it on paper.\u201d\nThe Liars\u2019 Club recreated and reflected on Karr\u2019s rugged and often traumatic childhood in an industrial town in East Texas. The work focuses primarily on events that took place between 1961 and 1963, when Karr was seven and eight years old, and the book contains the author\u2019s adult musings on her past and her family. In the course of the work, Karr describes mental illness, violence, neglect, and substance abuse. Her mother suffered from mental instability. Her father was a heavy drinker and a storyteller, an oil refinery worker who spent his leisure time at what many women in the small town called the \u201cliars\u2019 club,\u201d the back room of the local bait shop, where men gathered to socialize and spin yarns. Karr\u2019s more recent memoirs, including Cherry and Lit, continue her story into adolescence and adulthood.\nLike her prose, Karr\u2019s poetry treats events from her past; her style is frequently described as \u201cunsentimental\u201d and \u201cunsparing\u201d in its evocation of painful truths. David Barber described Karr\u2019s tone in her second book, The Devil\u2019s Tour: \u201cAvowedly unsentimental, Karr doesn\u2019t overcompensate by striking exaggerated poses of disabused wisdom or affecting mandarin disdain for the muddle of human relations\u2026 Hers are the measured lamentations of a writer who will always side with the painful certitude over the wishful thought.\u201d Karr\u2019s fourth poetry collection, Sinners Welcome, like the memoir Lit, includes meditative poems on Karr\u2019s recovery from alcoholism and her new found, perhaps surprising, sense of faith. Reviewing the collection for the New York Times, David Kirby found in Karr a careful, tough religious poet: \u201cImages rather than wishful abstractions abound,\u201d Kirby noted. \u201cSo much trickery has been got up to in religion's name that it's natural to get nervous when a writer starts talking about salvation, but Karr never tries to substitute faith for sound poetic practices. If anything, by adding prayer, she just makes the poems that much stronger.\u201d\nKarr\u2019s interest in concrete language and representing lived experience has been widely noted\u2014Karr herself has written about the need for poetry to remain grounded in direct, accessible language, in her essay \u201cAgainst Decoration,\u201d included in her book Viper Rum. Ellen Kaufman in Library Journal described the poems in that book as \u201cconfessional writing that conjures up the physical world.\u201d Ullman contended that the poems in Viper Rum \u201caffirm human gestures towards life by highlighting them as gestures\u2026 Karr peers beyond illusions of safety and is energized by the shadows out there, the persistent and unanswerable questions.\u201d\nMary Karr has received numerous honors and awards for her work, including fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and a Bunting Fellowship from Radcliffe College. She has received a Pushcart Prize, the PEN/Martha Albrand Award, and Whiting Writer\u2019s Award. She is a sought-after speaker who has given talks and lectures at major universities, libraries, and at the Weil Cornell Medical College, where she lectured during Grand Rounds in the psychiatric department in 2011. In 2012, she released an album of songs she wrote with singer Rodney Crowell, Kin.\u00a0Her memoir,\u00a0Lit,\u00a0is scheduled to become and HBO television series. Karr is the Jesse Truesdell Peck Professor of Literature at Syracuse University.\n\r\nReflecting upon her aspirations as an author, Karr told Publishers Weekly: \u201cPublic readings and the oral tradition [are] important to me. An aesthetic experience is fine, but unless someone is infused with feeling from a work of art, it\u2019s totally without conviction. My idea of art is, you write something that makes people feel so strongly that they get some conviction about who they want to be or what they want to do. It\u2019s morally useful not in a political way, but it makes your heart bigger; it\u2019s emotionally and spiritually empowering.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"]}}
