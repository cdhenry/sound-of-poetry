She is currently a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets and the inaugural Frederick Iseman Professor of Poetry at Yale University. She is the former Chair of the African American Studies Department at Yale University.\u00a0Alexander is a highly respected scholar, teacher, and mentor, as well as a founding member of Cave Canem, an organization dedicated to promoting African American poets and poetry. Her accomplishments within academia are numerous and include a Quantrelle Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching from the University of Chicago and fellowships from the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard and the Alphonse Fletcher Foundation.\n\r\nAlexander\u2019s career as a poet has likewise been impressive. Her book American Sublime (2005) was shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize, and in 2005 she was awarded the Jackson Poetry Prize. She is often recognized as a pivotal figure in African American poetry. When Barack Obama asked her to compose and read a poem for his Presidential inauguration, she joined the ranks of Robert Frost, Maya Angelou and Miller Williams; her poem, \u201cPraise Song for the Day,\u201d became a bestseller after it was published as a chapbook by Graywolf Press.\nAlexander writes on a variety of subjects, most notably race and gender, politics and history, and motherhood. The poet Clarence Major has described Alexander\u2019s \u201cinstinct for turning her profound cultural vision into one that illuminates universal experience,\u201d and Doris Lynch, writing for the Library Journal, commented that \u201cmemory and race\u201d are \u201ctwo of Alexander\u2019s most powerful themes,\u201d adding that \u201cwhen Alexander\u2019s forge is hot, the reader is transported to her world.\u201d Alexander\u2019s poems, short stories, and critical essays have been widely published in journals such as the Paris Review, the Kenyon Review, the Village Voice, and Prairie Schooner. Her verse play Diva Studies was produced by the Yale School of Drama in May, 1996.\nAlexander\u2019s first poetry collection, The Venus Hottentot (1990), won widespread praise from reviewers. The poems delve into the minds and emotions of historical black figures, including the eponymous character, Saartjie Baartman, who was exhibited in London and Paris before her death at 25, and was later dissected and infamously preserved by the Baron Cuvier. Reviewing the book for the New York Times, Doris Jean Austin called the collection \u201ca historical mosaic with profound cultural integrity,\u201d and a reviewer for Poetry magazine described it as \u201ca superb first book.\u201d Alexander\u2019s second collection, Body of Life (1996), continues to examine what Antioch Review contributor Harryette Mullen called \u201cthe ongoing public preoccupation with the black body.\u201d Mullen noted that Alexander \u201creminds readers that the life of the body cannot be separated from the construction of individual and collective identities.\u201d Like The Venus Hottentot before it, Body of Life mixes poems of personal and family experience with larger historical explorations. The Washington Post Book World described it as a book of \u201cgraceful elegance and easy musicality.\u201d\n\r\nAlexander\u2019s Antebellum Dream Book (2001) was named one of the \u201cTwenty-five Favorite Books of 2001\u201d in the Village Voice. As Cathy Hong stated in her review for the Voice Literary Supplement, the book \u201cmoves as if Alexander breathlessly awoke in the middle of the night and jotted down her somnolent wanderings in verse form.\u201d Hong also observed that \u201cAlexander\u2019s poems are deftly pared down, engagingly readable, and impressively generous in their coverage of historical and popular figures,\u201d including a long sequence in the voice of Muhammad Ali. The collection also features poems about paintings and sculpture, and a series of \u201cpostpartum\u201d dream poems which Fanonne Jeffers described in Black Issues Book Review, as \u201cby turns, erotic, poignant and delightfully outrageous.\u201d Ed Hirsch also remarked that the book used \u201cthe structure of dreams to meditate about the strangeness of race, the mysteries of family, the centrality of African American precursors, and the excitements\u2014the estrangements\u2014of motherhood,\u201d adding that it was Alexander\u2019s \u201cbest yet.\u201d \u00a0\n\nAmerican Sublime also garnered widespread praise when it was published in 2005, including a Pulitzer Prize nomination. The book weaves together personal and political histories in fascinating ways. Broken into four parts, each section centers on a different theme. The first, \u201cAmerican Blue,\u201d interweaves Alexander\u2019s personal experiences, from childhood to adulthood, with historical events from the 1970s through the present. In the third cycle, \u201cAmistad,\u201d Alexander recounts the famous 1839 slave-ship rebellion from the points of view of several of the participants. Reviewing the collection for the New York Times, Joel Brouwer noted that \u201cthe best moments are those in which present and past collide, sending off welcome sparks,\u201d and attributing \u201cAlexander\u2019s greatest gift\u201d to her ability to show, again and again, \u201cFaulkner\u2019s claim that \u2018the past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past.\u2019\u201d\n\r\nHer other recent books of poetry include Crave Radiance: New and Selected Poems 1990-2010 (2012).\n\r\nAlexander is also an important voice in African American literary criticism. Her writings on artists, writers and aesthetics are valued for their poise and erudition. The title of The Black Interior (2003), a collection of essays, refers to what Alexander sees as the \u201cblack life and creativity behind the public face of stereotype and limited imagination.\u201d In these essays Alexander discusses the lives and works of famous African American artists, including writers Langston Hughes and Anna Cooper, poets Gwendolyn Brooks and Michael Harper, and actor Denzel Washington, and attempts to explain the cultural role that such artists play and have played in both the African American and wider American communities. Alexander also branches out to discuss, among other things, the stereotype of the African American male, the murder trial of O.J. Simpson, and the nature of Jet magazine. \u201cHer concluding piece on the Rodney King case ... is a tour de force,\u201d wrote a Kirkus Reviews contributor. Power and Possibility (2007) collected Alexander\u2019s interviews, essays and reviews, again focusing on African American artistic and cultural production. Literary critic Arnold Rampersad called Alexander \u201cone of the brightest stars in our literary sky \u2026 a superb, invaluable commentator on the American scene.\u201d Her autobiography\u00a0The Light of the World (2015) was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award.\n\r\nElizabeth Alexander\u2019s careful, precise poetry and her awareness of history, especially African American history, as well as her personal friendship with the Obamas, made her a natural choice as President Obama\u2019s inaugural poet. Alexander became only the fourth poet ever asked to read at a presidential inauguration, and her poem, \u201cPraise Song for the Day\u201d was heard and watched by billions worldwide. Based on traditional African praise songs, which commemorate the life of an individual in an incantatory call-and-response, Alexander\u2019s poem focused less on President Obama and more on ordinary Americans, attempting to describe the details, languages and encounters that shape their lives. Alexander gestured toward the history of the Civil Rights Movement and its importance to the occasion\u2014\u201cSay it plain, that many have died for this day\u201d\u2014but also attempted to summarize a national journey. The poem helped make Alexander one of the most publically-known and respected poets writing today.\n\u00a0\n[Updated 2015]\n", "attrs": {}}
