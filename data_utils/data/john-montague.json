In New York the family struggled through the Great Depression, and in 1933 four-year-old Montague and his two brothers were sent back to Ireland. Montague was raised by two aunts on the family farm and educated at the seminary of Saint Patrick\u2019s College in Armagh. He attended the University College Dublin, where he published his first poems. In 1953 Montague enrolled at Yale University on a Fulbright fellowship, studying with Robert Penn Warren, and would also study at\u00a0the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop and the University of California-Berkeley.\u00a0Montague later settled in\u00a0Paris, where he was the Paris correspondent for the Irish Times and became close friends with playwright Samuel Beckett. He eventually returned to Ireland, settling in Cork.\r\n\u00a0\r\nMontague\u2019s poems often find their shape in extended sequences that engage themes of travel and exile, national identity, and personal loss. As Edna Longey noted in the Times Literary Supplement: \u201cmore than any poet of his generation he opened up channels between the Irish and English tradition, between regional and cosmopolitan allegiances, between Ulster and Irish perspectives.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nMontague is the author of numerous collections of poetry, including A Drunken Sailor (2004), Collected Poems (1995),\u00a0Time in Armagh (1993), The Dead Kingdom (1984), The Rough Field (1972), and Poisoned Lands (1961). Montague also translated the work of several French poets, including Eug\u00e8ne Guillevic\u2019s 1961 volume Carnac (2000), Claude Esteban\u2019s 1972 volume Sur La Derni\u00e8re Lande, as A Smile Between the Stones (2004), and, with cotranslator Evelyn Robson, November: A Choice of Translations from Andre Frenaud (1972). Montague edited the anthologies Bitter Harvest: An Anthology of Contemporary Irish Verse (1989) and the Faber Book of Irish Verse (1974).\r\n\u00a0\r\nMontague is also the author of the story collections Berkeley\u2019s Telephone and Other Fictions (2000), An Occasion of Sin (1992) and Death of a Chieftain (1964), as well as the novella The Lost Notebook (1987), the essay collection The Figure in the Cave (1989), and the memoirs Company (2001) and Born in Brooklyn (1991).\r\n\u00a0\r\nMontague\u2019s honors include the American Ireland Fund Literary Award, The Irish-American Cultural Institute\u2019s Award for Literature, the Marten Toonder Award, a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship, and an honorary doctorate from the State University of New York at Buffalo.\u00a0In 1998, Montague became the first Ireland Professor of Poetry.\r\n\u00a0\r\nMontague taught at the University of Albany-SUNY\u00a0and at University College-Cork. He split his time between Cork and Nice until his death in 2016.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Ireland & Northern Ireland"]}}
