A writer and activist born to free blacks in New Hampshire, Whitfield began publishing writing in support of African American rights by age 16.\nAn ardent abolitionist poet, Whitfield worked as a barber to support his writing but desired a more intellectually engaging position during a time when few options existed for free African Americans. However, Whitfield rose to prominence as a poet and social critic, publishing poems in The Liberator and two publications by Frederick Douglass, The North Star and Frederick Douglass\u2019 Paper.\nWhitfield lived and worked in Buffalo and in the Pacific Northwest. He published numerous poems and letters in San Francisco newspapers supporting African American civil rights and citizenship. Upon his death in San Francisco, Whitfield was buried in San Francisco\u2019s Masonic Cemetery.Whitfield\u2019s collections include Poems (1846) and America and Other Poems (1853), which he dedicated to activist Martin Delany. Whitfield and Delany supported African American colonization in Central and South America\u2014an idea Whitfield disavowed during the Civil War. Whitfield\u2019s verse is notable for its metrical control, classical imagery, and historical scope. Often bitter, he denounces oppression, the moral corruption of church and state, and the effects of racism on African Americans.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
