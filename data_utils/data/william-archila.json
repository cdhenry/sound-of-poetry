He earned an MFA at the University of Oregon. His poems engage themes of social justice, brutality and identity. In an online interview with the Poetry Society of America, Archila states, \u201cTo me the function of poetry is about naming the truth. It is about constructing a new language, and as long as there is a necessity to aesthetically form an authentic voice, there's no need to examine whether it's important or not. The human voice in struggle will always be important.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nArchila is the author of the poetry collections The Art of Exile (2009), which won the Emerging Writer Fellowship Award from the Writer\u2019s Center as well as the International Latino Book Award, and The Gravedigger\u2019s Archaeology (2015), which won the Letras Latinas/Red Hen Poetry Prize. His poetry is also featured in\u00a0anthologies including\u00a0Another City: Writing from Los Angeles (2001), Kalina:\u00a0Theatre Under My Skin,\u00a0Contemporary Salvadoran Poetry\u00a0(2014), and The Wandering Song: Central American Writing in the United States\u00a0(2017).\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
