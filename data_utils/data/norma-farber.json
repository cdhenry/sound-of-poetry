She was the author of six poetry collections, including The Hatch (1955), A Desperate Thing: Marriage is a Desperate Thing (1973), and Something Further: Poems (1979), and her work often engaged biblical narratives and the nature of language itself. Year of Reversible Loss (2012), her posthumously published lyric meditation on the death of her husband, the scientist Sidney Farber, was praised by poet Robert Pinsky for its \u201cformal doubleness,\u201d weaving essay and verse to produce a memoir that is as \u201cattentive as it is candid, cool as it is heartfelt, elegant as it is passionate.\u201d \u00a0 During her lifetime, Farber published 18 children\u2019s books, including Did You Know It Was the Narwhale? (1967); National Book Award finalist As I Was Crossing Boston Common (1975), illustrated by Arnold Lobel; I Found Them in the Yellow Pages (1973), illustrated by Marc Brown); the children\u2019s poetry collections Small Wonders: Poems (1979) and Never Say Ugh! to a Bug (1979); as well as the Lewis Carroll\u2013inspired hybrid Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast: Stories & Poems (1977) and the young adult novel Mercy Short: A Winter Journal, North Boston 1692\u20131693 (1982). \u00a0 Farber\u2019s poetry received the New England Poetry Club\u2019s Golden Rose Award and numerous awards from the Poetry Society of America. That organization honors her contribution to the field by annually awarding the Norma Farber First Book Award to an American poet. \u00a0 A selection of her papers, mainly related to her children\u2019s books, is held at the University of Minnesota Libraries Children\u2019s Literature Research Collections. Farber died of vascular disease in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1984.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
