He earned an MA from the University of Washington, where he studied with Theodore Roethke and Elizabeth Bishop. His collections of poetry include The Rough-Hewn Table (1971), winner of the Devins Award; Running Lights (1981);\u00a0Rain (1994); and Oregon (2013).\nCarlile\u2019s poems are often located in the landscape of the Pacific Northwest. Paul Giles, in \u201c\u2018Like a Black Bell\u2019: On the Poetry of Henry Carlile\u201d in the Oregon Literary Review, noted the dark humor and \u201cmetaphysical inclinations\u201d in Carlile\u2019s work. Commenting on Rain, Giles noted that \u201cCarlile\u2019s language circles humorously over the savage immensities it chooses to alight upon only casually.\u201d\nCarlile has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Oregon Arts Commission, and the Ingram Merrill Foundation. He has had poems published in the American Poetry Review, Poetry, Shenandoah, and the Southern Review.\nCarlile taught for many years at Portland State University in Oregon and retired in 2003.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
