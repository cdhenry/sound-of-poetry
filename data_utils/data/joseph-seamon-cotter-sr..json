At 22 he enrolled in night school, slowly earning his certification as a grammar school teacher and principal. He taught in several Louisville schools over the next 50 years. He also published nine volumes of poetry, plays, and fiction including A Rhyming (1895), Links of Friendship (1898), A White Song and a Black One (1909), and Collected Poems of Joseph S. Cotter Sr. (1938). Cotter maintained a close friendship with poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, and his own poetry ranges from historical tribute to social satire, engaging racial issues and philosophy in a wide range of formal styles.\n\r\nCotter married Maria F. Cox in 1891. Their eldest son, Joseph Jr., published a volume of poetry (The Band of Gideon and Other Lyrics, 1918) before his early death at the age of 23.\n\r\nCotter died at home in Louisville in 1949.
