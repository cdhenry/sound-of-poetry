He earned a BA at Northeastern University and an MFA at the University of Iowa. Anderson\u2019s meditative, lyric poems explore memory, death, and the natural world. \u201cMy prime motive for writing is self-confrontation, and I find poems the best way to employ language to do this,\u201d Anderson said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. \u201cMy poetry isn\u2019t for everyone. It\u2019s for people like myself who want to contend with themselves. I think of my poems as intimate conversations with close friends, to whom I\u2019m not afraid to reveal my vulnerabilities and loneliness.\u201d \u00a0 During his lifetime, Anderson published seven volumes of poetry, including Day Moon (2001), The Milky Way: Poems 1967\u20131982 (1983), the National Book Award\u2013nominated Death & Friends (1970), and Looking for Jonathan (1968). His poetry has been featured in numerous anthologies, including The New American Poets (1960), The Morrow Anthology of Younger American Poets (1985), and The American Poetry Anthology (1983). Anderson\u2019s honors included a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, two awards from the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Poetry Society of America\u2019s Shelley Memorial Award.  \u00a0 He taught for nearly 30 years at the University of Arizona as well as at the University of Portland, Ohio University, the University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Iowa.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {}}
