His verses were characterized by ironic wit and a spirit of fiery independence. From the time he began publishing them\u2014both under his own name, and under the name Joseph Brodsky\u2014he aroused the ire of Soviet authorities. He was also persecuted because he was Jewish. He was brought to trial for \u201cparasitism,\u201d and a\u00a0smuggled transcript of that trial helped bring him to the attention of the West, for he answered his interrogators with courageous and articulate idealism. Brodsky was condemned to a Soviet mental institution and later spent five years in Arkhangelsk, an Arctic labor camp. A public outcry from American and European intellectuals helped to secure his early release. Forced to emigrate, he moved to Michigan in 1972, where, with the help of the poet\u00a0W.H. Auden, he settled in at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor as poet-in-residence. He then taught at several universities, including Queens College in New York and Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. He continued to write poetry, often writing in Russian and translating his own work into English, and eventually winning the Nobel Prize for his work. His predominant themes were exile and loss, and he was widely praised for his hauntingly eloquent style.\n\r\nIn many ways, Brodsky had lived as an exile before leaving his homeland. His father had lost a position of rank in the Russian Navy because he was Jewish, and the family lived in poverty. Trying to escape the ever-present images of Lenin, Brodsky quit school and embarked on a self-directed education, reading literary classics and working a variety of unusual jobs, including assisting a coroner and a geologist in Central Asia. He learned English and Polish so that he would be able to translate the poems of\u00a0John Donne\u00a0and\u00a0Czeslaw Milosz. His own poetry expressed his independent character with an originality admired by poets such as\u00a0Anna Akhmatova.\n\r\nAccording to a\u00a0Times Literary Supplement\u00a0reviewer, Brodsky\u2019s poetry \u201cis religious, intimate, depressed, sometimes confused, sometimes martyr-conscious, sometimes elitist in its views, but it does not constitute an attack on Soviet society or ideology unless withdrawal and isolation are deliberately construed as attack: of course they can be, and evidently were.\u201d According to a reviewer in\u00a0Time,\u00a0the poet\u2019s expulsion from Russia was \u201cthe culmination of an inexplicable secret-police vendetta against him that has been going on for over a decade.\u201d Brodsky said: \u201cThey have simply kicked me out of my country, using the Jewish issue as an excuse.\u201d The vendetta first came to a head in a Leningrad trial in 1964, when Brodsky was charged with writing \u201cgibberish\u201d instead of doing honest work; he was sentenced to five years hard labor. Protests from artists and writers helped to secure his release after 18 months, but his poetry still was banned. Israel invited him to immigrate, and the government encouraged him to go; Brodsky, though, refused, explaining that he did not identify with the Jewish state. Finally, Russian officials insisted that he leave the country. Despite the pressures, Brodsky reportedly wrote to Leonid Brezhnev before leaving Moscow asking for \u201can opportunity to continue to exist in Russian literature and on Russian soil.\u201d\n\r\nBrodsky\u2019s poetry bears the marks of his confrontations with the Russian authorities. \u201cBrodsky is someone who has tasted extremely bitter bread,\u201d wrote\u00a0Stephen Spender\u00a0in\u00a0New Statesman, \u201cand his poetry has the air of being ground out between his teeth. \u2026 It should not be supposed that he is a liberal, or even a socialist. He deals in unpleasing, hostile truths and is a realist of the least comforting and comfortable kind. Everything nice that you would like him to think, he does not think. But he is utterly truthful, deeply religious, fearless and pure. Loving, as well as hating.\u201d\n\r\nThough one might expect Brodsky\u2019s poetry to be basically political in nature, this is not the case. \u201cBrodsky\u2019s recurrent themes are lyric poets\u2019 traditional, indeed timeless concerns\u2014man and nature, love and death, the ineluctability of anguish, the fragility of human achievements and attachments, the preciousness of the privileged moment, the \u2018unrepeatable.\u2019 The tenor of his poetry is not so much apolitical as antipolitical,\u201d wrote Victor Erlich. \u201cHis besetting sin was not \u2018dissent\u2019 in the proper sense of the word, but a total, and on the whole quietly undemonstrative, estrangement from the Soviet ethos.\u201d\n\r\nBrodsky elaborated on the relationship between poetry and politics in his Nobel lecture, \u201cUncommon Visage,\u201d published in\u00a0Poets & Writers\u00a0magazine. Art teaches the writer, he said, \u201cthe privateness of the human condition. Being the most ancient as well as the most literal form of private enterprise, it fosters in a man \u2026 a sense of his uniqueness, of individuality, or separateness\u2014thus turning him from a social animal into an autonomous \u2018I.\u2019 \u2026 A work of art, of literature especially, and a poem in particular, addresses a man tete-a-tete, entering with him into direct\u2014free of any go-betweens\u2014relations.\u201d\n\r\nIn addition, literature points to experience that transcends political limits. Brodsky observed, \u201cLanguage and, presumably, literature are things that are more ancient and inevitable, more durable than any form of social organization. The revulsion, irony, or indifference often expressed by literature toward the state is essentially the reaction of the permanent\u2014better yet, the infinite\u2014against the temporary, against the finite. \u2026 The real danger for a writer is not so much the possibility (and often the certainty) of persecution on the part of the state, as it is the possibility of finding oneself mesmerized by the state\u2019s features which, whether monstrous or undergoing changes for the better, are always temporary.\u201d\n\r\nBrodsky went on to say that creative writing is an essential exercise of individual freedom, since the writer must make many aesthetic judgments and choices during the process of composition. He pointed out, \u201cIt is precisely in this \u2026 sense that we should understand Dostoyevsky\u2019s remark that beauty will save the world, or\u00a0Matthew Arnold\u2019s belief that we shall be saved by poetry. It is probably too late for the world, but for the individual man there always remains a chance. \u2026 If what distinguishes us from other members of the animal kingdom is speech, then literature\u2014and poetry, in particular, being the highest form of locution\u2014is, to put it bluntly, the goal of our species.\u201d\n\r\nEven more compelling than the relationship between poetry and politics is the relationship between the writer and his language, Brodsky claimed. He explained that the first experience the writer has when taking up a pen to write \u201cis \u2026 the sensation of immediately falling into dependence on language, on everything that has already been uttered, written, and accomplished in it.\u201d But the past accomplishments of a language do not impinge on the writer more than the sense of its vast potential. Brodsky added, \u201cThere are times when, by means of a single word, a single rhyme, the writer of a poem manages to find himself where no one has ever been before him, further, perhaps, than he himself would have wished for. \u2026 Having experienced this acceleration once \u2026 one falls into dependency on this process, the way others fall into dependency on drugs or alcohol.\u201d\n\r\nIn keeping with these views, Brodsky\u2019s poetry is known for its originality. Arthur C. Jacobs in the\u00a0Jewish Quarterly\u00a0noted that Brodsky is \u201cquite apart from what one thinks of as the main current of Russian verse.\u201d A critic in\u00a0New Leader\u00a0wrote: \u201cThe noisy rant and attitudinizing rhetoric of public issues are superfluous to Brodsky\u2019s moral vision and contradictory to his craft. As with all great lyric poets, Brodsky attends to the immediate, the specific, to what he has internally known and felt, to the lucidities of observation heightened and defined by thought.\u201d\n\r\nThough many critics agreed that Brodsky was one of the finest contemporary Russian poets, some felt that the English translations of his poetry are less impressive. Commenting on George L. Kline\u2019s translation of\u00a0Selected Poems, Joseph Brodsky,\u00a0Stephen Spender wrote: \u201cThese poems are impressive in English, though one is left having to imagine the technical virtuosity of brilliant rhyming in the originals. \u2026 One is never quite allowed to forget that one is reading a second-hand version.\u201d In\u00a0A Part of Speech,\u00a0Brodsky gathered the work of several translators and made amendments to some of the English versions in an attempt to restore the character of the originals. Brodsky\u2019s personal style remains somewhat elusive in that collection due to the subtle effects he achieves in the original Russian, Tom Simmons observed in the\u00a0Christian Science Monitor.\u00a0Brodsky, he said, \u201cis a poet of dramatic yet delicate vision\u2014a man with a sense of the increasingly obscured loftiness of human life. But under no circumstances is his poetry dully ethereal. \u2026 He can portray a luminous moment or a time of seemingly purposeless suffering with equal clarity.\u201d\n\r\nErlich also felt that some of the lines in\u00a0Selected Poems\u00a0are \u201cstrained or murky,\u201d but that Brodsky at his best had the \u201coriginality, incisiveness, depth and formal mastery which mark a major poet.\u201d Czeslaw Milosz felt that Brodsky\u2019s background allowed him to make a vital contribution to literature. Writing in the\u00a0New York Review of Books,\u00a0Milosz stated, \u201cBehind Brodsky\u2019s poetry is the experience of political terror, the experience of the debasement of man and the growth of the totalitarian empire. \u2026 I find it fascinating to read his poems as part of his larger enterprise, which is no less than an attempt to fortify the place of man in a threatening world.\u201d This enterprise connected Brodsky to the literary traditions of other times and cultures. Erlich concluded that \u201cthe richness and versatility of his gifts, the liveliness and vigor of his intelligence, and his increasingly intimate bond with the Anglo-American literary tradition, augur well for his survival in exile, indeed for his further creative growth.\u201d\n\r\nExile was always difficult for Brodsky. In one poem, he described an exiled writer as one \u201cwho survives like a fish in the sand.\u201d Despite these feelings, Brodsky was largely unmoved by the sweeping political changes that accompanied the fall of the Soviet Union. He told David Remnick, then of the\u00a0Washington Post,\u00a0that those changes were \u201cdevoid of autobiographical interest\u201d for him, and that his allegiance was to his language. In the\u00a0Detroit Free Press,\u00a0Bob McKelvey cited Brodsky\u2019s declaration from a letter: \u201cI belong to the Russian culture. I feel part of it, its component, and no change of place can influence the final consequence of this. A language is a much more ancient and inevitable thing than a state. I belong to the Russian language.\u201d\n\r\nShortly before his death in 1996, Brodsky completed\u00a0So Forth,\u00a0a collection of poems he wrote in English, or translated himself from poetry he wrote in Russian.\u00a0So Forth\u00a0was judged inferior to Brodsky\u2019s best work by several critics, including Michael Glover, who in\u00a0New Statesman\u00a0described the collection as \u201cmore failure than success.\u201d Glover felt that too often Brodsky \u201clapses into a kind of swashbuckling slanginess, a kind of raw muscularity that, at its worst, reads like embarrassing doggerel.\u201d Yet others found\u00a0So Forth powerful, such as the\u00a0Publishers Weekly\u00a0reviewer who called it \u201can astonishing collection from a writer able to mix the cerebral and the sensual, the political and the intimate, the elegiac and the comic. \u2026 Brodsky\u2019s death is a loss to literature; his final collection of poems is the best consolation we could ask for.\u201d\n\nCollected Poems in English,\u00a0published posthumously, is a definitive collection of Brodsky\u2019s translated work and his original work in English. It is \u201cdramatic and ironic, melancholy and blissful,\u201d wrote Donna Seaman in\u00a0Booklist.\u00a0She argued this volume \u201cwill stand as one of the twentieth century\u2019s tours de force.\u201d Collected Poems in English\u00a0is \u201ca highly accomplished, deft, and entertaining book, with a talent for exploitation of the richness of language and with a deep core of sorrow,\u201d in the estimation of Judy Clarence in\u00a0Library Journal.\u00a0It captures Brodsky\u2019s trademark sense of \u201cstepping aside and peering in bewilderment\u201d at life, according to Sven Birkerts in the\u00a0New York Review of Books.\u00a0Birkerts concluded: \u201cBrodsky charged at the world with full intensity and wrestled his perceptions into lines that fairly vibrate with what they are asked to hold. There is no voice, no vision, remotely like it.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Russia"]}}
