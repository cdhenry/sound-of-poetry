He is the author of The Gatehouse Heaven (1998), which was chosen by poet Charles Wright for the Kathryn A. Morton Prize from Sarabande Books, and My Psychic (2006). He and artist Yu Jung-yul co-translated the collection Three Poets of Modern Korea: Yi Sang, Hahm Dong-Seon, and Choi Young-Mi (2002).\r\n\u00a0\nPoetry described the works in The Gatehouse Heaven thusly: \u201cby turns plain and ornate, literal-minded and highly stylized, Kimbrell\u2019s poems mediate the claims of dream and memoir, romantic vision and drab reality, the sacred and profane.\u201d The title poem is a meditation on the difficulties of connection between a mentally ill father and his son. In a review for Coldfront magazine, John Deming found My Psychic, which contains elegies to Kimbrell\u2019s mother, to be \u201ca consoling look at grief and the impossibly hopeful ways people can strike back at it.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nKimbrell has received a National Endowment for the Arts Individual Fellowship, a Ruth Lilly Prize, and a Whiting Writers\u2019 Award.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"]}}
