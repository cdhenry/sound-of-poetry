Much of his poetry was acknowledged to be difficult to understand because of its tortuous syntax, ambiguous expressions, and obscure imagery. His poetry became highly influential in France and beyond, including in the United States, among poets looking for new and innovative ways to write, during the turbulent times of the early 1900s.\n\r\nSt\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9\u2014as he is\u00a0known, although his birth certificate records his first name in its more usual French form of \u201cEtienne\u201d\u2014was born into a middle-class family on March 18, 1842 in Paris. After an undistinguished school career he spent a year in London, from November 1862 to November 1863, to gain an English teaching certificate. On his return to France he took a teaching post in the small town of Tournon just south of Lyon. He was to remain a teacher, although a reluctant and not very good one, first at Tournon, then at Besan\u00e7on, at Avignon, and finally at various schools in Paris. After several unsuccessful attempts, he managed to obtain early retirement on health grounds in November 1893. By then his reputation as France\u2019s greatest living poet was firmly established through the publication of his poems in various literary magazines and partial collections and through the admiring essay on him that Verlaine wrote in his celebrated volume\u00a0Les Po\u00e8tes Maudits\u00a0(The Accursed Poets, 1884). The \u201cmardis,\u201d weekly Tuesday evening meetings that he held in his Paris apartment from 1880 onward, were eagerly attended by the leading figures in literature, painting, and music. His retirement meant that he was able to spend more time at his country retreat at Valvins on the banks of the upper Seine, where he died unexpectedly on September 9, 1898 at the age of 56.\n\r\nAlthough he had been a prolific writer of fairly unremarkable poems in the early 1860s, he produced far fewer but far more significant and original works during the rest of his career. The relatively small number of poems Mallarm\u00e9 wished to preserve\u2014some 50 in all\u2014were collected in one slim volume of\u00a0Les Po\u00e9sies de S. Mallarm\u00e9, which appeared early in 1899, although twice as many poems, which he left unpublished, have been added to some modern editions, along with a considerable quantity of \u201cvers de circonstance\u201d\u2014amusing and ingeniously rhymed verses that he delighted in addressing to friends. He was also the author of a dozen prose poems and several other prose works. Near the end of his life he wrote a work that deserves particular mention because of its extreme originality and the notoriety it has achieved:\u00a0Un coup de d\u00e9s jamais n\u2019abolira le hasard\u00a0(A throw of the dice will never abolish chance, 1914), which originally appeared in the May 1897 issue of\u00a0Cosmopolis.\n\r\nMallarm\u00e9\u2019s\u00a0Po\u00e9sies, unlike Baudelaire\u2019s\u00a0Les Fleurs du Mal\u00a0(1857), does not appear to be arranged in any significant way. If, however, the poems are studied in chronological order, according to the dates when they were begun (there is sometimes a gap of as much as 20 years between a poem\u2019s initial inspiration and its final publication), the same principal theme emerges from them as from\u00a0Les Fleurs du Mal\u2014the poet\u2019s longing to turn his back on the harsh world of reality and to seek refuge in an ideal world. This attitude may have been inherited from the Romanticism of the early years of the 19th century, but in Baudelaire\u2019s case it may also have had its roots in personal factors, namely the double blow of his father\u2019s death and his mother\u2019s second marriage 18 months later. Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s childhood was similar in that his mother died in 1847, when he was five years old, and his father remarried 15 months later. A third blow was the death of his sister, Maria, two years younger than himself, in 1857. It is not surprising, therefore, that, with an urgency greater even than that of Baudelaire, Mallarm\u00e9 should have wanted to escape from a world that had treated him so cruelly.\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that in one of his earliest poems, \u201cApparition\u201d (Apparition), written in 1862, when he was 20, his future wife, Maria Gerhard (her first name and the fact that she was seven years older than Mallarm\u00e9 may be psychologically significant), is metamorphosed in the final lines into the maternal figure remembered from long ago:\nQui jadis, sur mes beaux sommeils d\u2019enfant g\u00e2t\u00e9\r\nPassait, laissant toujours de ses mains mal ferm\u00e9es\r\nNeiger de blancs bouquets d\u2019\u00e9toiles parfum\u00e9es.\n(Who, in the blissful dreams of my happy childhood\r\nUsed to hover above me sprinkling from her gentle hands\r\nSnow-white clusters of perfumed stars.)\nMallarm\u00e9 married Gerhard in August 1863, but although the marriage was a lasting and, to all outward appearances, a tolerably happy one, this attempt to find in love a means of transforming the ideal into reality was short-lived. In \u201cLes Fen\u00eatres\u201d (The Windows), written in 1863, it is replaced by an outright rejection of the real and an overwhelming desire to flee toward the ideal: \u201cJe fuis et je m\u2019accroche \u00e0 toutes les crois\u00e9es / D\u2019o\u00f9 l\u2019on tourne l\u2019\u00e9paule \u00e0 la vie\u201d (I flee and cling to all those windows / Where one can turn one\u2019s back on life).\n\r\nThis new attitude could well be explained by yet another blow that Mallarm\u00e9 suffered: less than a month after his 21st birthday and just before he wrote \u201cLes Fen\u00eatres,\u201d his father died in April 1863. It may be for this reason that, in contrasting the pain and ugliness of the real world with the beauty and happiness of the ideal world, Mallarm\u00e9 uses, in the first half of the poem, the allegory of a dying man turning his back on the sick room and longing for a new life in the sky beyond the windows:\nSon oeil, \u00e0 l\u2019horizon de lumi\u00e8re gorg\u00e9e,\r\nVoit des gal\u00e8res d\u2019or, belles comme des cygnes\r\nSur un fleuve de pourpre et de parfums dormir.\n(He sees, on the horizon filled with light,\r\nGolden galleons as lovely as swans,\r\nMoored on a broad river of scented purple.)\nIn the second half of the poem, where the allegory is interpreted, it is no longer through love that the ideal world is to be attained:\nJe me mire et me vois ange! et je meurs, et j\u2019aime\r\n\u2014Que la vitre soit l\u2019art, soit la mysticit\u00e9\u2014\r\nA rena\u00eetre, portant mon r\u00eave en diad\u00e8me,\r\nAu ciel ant\u00e9rieur o\u00f9 fleurit la Beaut\u00e9.\n(I can see my reflection like that of an angel!\r\nAnd I feel that I am dying, and, through the medium\r\nOf art or of mystical experience, I want to be reborn,\r\nWearing my dream like a diadem, in some better land\r\nWhere beauty flourishes.)\nIn the final lines, however, the poet fears that he does not possess these artistic or mystical powers\u2014or at least that such powers as he may possess in his \u201cailes sans plumes\u201d (useless wings) are inadequate for the task of soaring up toward the ideal world.\nThis feeling of inadequacy rapidly became increasingly acute, so much so that in \u201cL\u2019Azur\u201d (The Sky), written in January 1864, there is a complete reversal of the theme of \u201cLes Fen\u00eatres.\u201d Mallarm\u00e9 now turns his back on the unattainable ideal world.\u00a0Instead of pouring scorn on ordinary mortals \u201cvautr\u00e9s dans le bonheur\u201d (wallowing in happiness), as he had put it, he now wants to belong to this \u201cb\u00e9tail heureux des hommes\u201d (contented herd of human beings). The reason for this\u00a0volte-face\u00a0is that whereas Mallarm\u00e9 had at first merely longed for the ideal world in a vague kind of way and had done no more than suggest that art might be one way of attaining it, in the six months separating \u201cLes Fen\u00eatres\u201d from \u201cL\u2019Azur\u201d he had tried to define his ideas more clearly and had failed.\n\r\nHe had discovered that to write something other than mere descriptive verse dealing with objects in the real world, to try to give poetic form to an immaterial world was an apparently impossible task. Yet it was one he could not escape, as the last two verses of \u201cL\u2019Azur\u201d make clear, for although the preceding verses describe Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s failure to write poetry evocative of the ideal world, they lead up to an account of his failure to shake off his obsession with that world and culminate in the agonizing final cry: \u201cJe suis hant\u00e9. L\u2019Azur! L\u2019Azur! L\u2019Azur! L\u2019Azur!\u201d (I am haunted by the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky!).\n\r\nIn fact, Mallarm\u00e9 did manage to free himself from his obsession in his next two poems, \u201cLas de l\u2019amer repos\u201d (Bitterly weary of my idleness) and \u201cLes Fleurs\u201d (Flowers), in which, reluctant to abandon poetry completely, yet tired of vainly struggling to evoke an ideal world, he chooses a middle course and consoles himself with writing facile, descriptive verse about the world around him. His escape was to be a temporary one, however, for in \u201cLe Pitre ch\u00e2ti\u00e9\u201d (The Turncoat Chastised), written initially in March 1864 and extensively rewritten much later, the poet is punished because he has been a traitor to his true vocation. In \u201cSoupir\u201d (Aspiration), written a month later, the wheel comes full circle, and Mallarm\u00e9 is again in something of the same state of mind he had been in at the end of \u201cL\u2019Azur,\u201d except that he is now reconciled to his fate and sadly recognizes that, however long and difficult his task may be, he has no alternative but to try to define his ideal world and to find means of evoking it in his poetry.\n\r\nIf \u201cSoupir\u201d to some extent echoes \u201cL\u2019Azur,\u201d so too does one of the most celebrated and compelling of Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s poems, the sonnet beginning \u201cLe vierge, le vivace et le bel aujourd\u2019hui\u201d (Will this be the day, dawning lively and lovely), which, although published in 1884, undoubtedly dates from some 20 years earlier. Behind the image of a swan longing to soar into the sky but trapped in the frozen waters of a lake, the poem\u2019s theme is clearly that of someone haunted by an ambition he is powerless to achieve. As each day dawns he is full of hope that he will at last manage to launch himself toward his goal, but he repeatedly finds not only that he is unable to do so, but also that the more he hesitates, reflects, and ponders, the more he succumbs to a fatal inactivity. Inspiration of the kind he wants has deserted Mallarm\u00e9, yet he refuses to yield, as he had done in \u201cLas de l\u2019amer repos\u201d and \u201cLes Fleurs,\u201d to the temptation of writing verse of an easier kind; he thus remains a \u201cfant\u00f4me qu\u2019\u00e0 ce lieu son pur \u00e9clat assigne\u201d (pale ghost condemned to this fate by the purity of his ideals).\n\r\nInstead he turns to poetry dealing indirectly and allegorically with his problem in two of his best-known works, \u201cH\u00e9rodiade\u201d (Herodias) and\u00a0L\u2019Apr\u00e8s-midi d\u2019un faune\u00a0(The Afternoon of a Faun, 1876). Both of these dramatic poems underwent many changes and modifications over the years, and \u201cH\u00e9rodiade\u201d was in fact never completed, but there is little doubt that the scene between Herodias and her nurse (the only part published under Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s supervision) dates from 1864 to 1865, and that, in its essential features,\u00a0L\u2019Apr\u00e8s-midi d\u2019un faune\u00a0(which, almost 30 years later, was to inspire Debussy\u2019s celebrated\u00a0Pr\u00e9lude) dates from 1865 to 1866.\n\r\nThe heroine of \u201cH\u00e9rodiade\u201d is the biblical character more generally known as Salome.\u00a0Mallarm\u00e9 may have preferred the alternative name so as to emphasize that he was concerned not with the sensuous dancer of popular legend but with an ascetic figure who is repelled by the slightest contact with the sensual world, and who, in the later, uncompleted stages of the play, was to demand the head of John the Baptist because he had inadvertently caught a glimpse of her naked body. This reversal of the character generally attributed to Salome may mean that Mallarm\u00e9 is using her as a symbol of his own situation. He implied as much when, in a July 1866 letter to a friend, he wrote \u201cJe m\u2019y \u00e9tais mis tout entier sans le savior\u201d (My whole being was expressed in it without my knowing it), and Herodias\u2019s rejection of the easy pleasures of the senses with which the nurse tempts her seems to continue the theme of the immediately preceding poems in which Mallarm\u00e9 had persistently turned his back on the superficialities of the real world. There is, however, a change of tone, for the period of failure, despair, and resignation is over. The poem ends on an expectant note, giving the sense that Mallarm\u00e9 is now on the verge of defining the nature of his ideal world: \u201c \u2026 sentant parmi les r\u00eaveries / Se s\u00e9parer enfin les froides pierreries\u201d ( \u2026\u00a0feeling vague, uncertain dreams / crystallize at last into something sharper and clearer).\n\r\n\u00a0L\u2019Apr\u00e8s-midi d\u2019un faune\u00a0uses two nymphs to symbolize the conflict between the real and the ideal in which Mallarm\u00e9\u00a0\u00a0was enmeshed. One seems to represent the world of the senses, while the purer of the two may well symbolize the world of the intellect. Since the faun of the title is able to master neither of them, one might hazard the conclusion that Mallarm\u00e9 is again presenting his own predicament of a poet moving away from the material world but having not yet reached the immaterial world, and who is consequently incapable of dealing satisfactorily with either.\n\r\nIf the cold light of reason\u2014Herodias\u2019s \u201cclair regard de diamant\u201d (crystal-clear gaze)\u2014is turned upon the problem of the existence of the ideal world, the inevitable conclusion is that beyond the real world there lies nothing but an empty void. Yet, if at the same time and despite the evidence of the senses, the conviction is firmly held that the ideal world does exist, then the inescapable conclusion is that it somehow lies hidden in this empty void. This belief is expressed symbolically in \u201cSainte,\u201d written in December 1865 and first titled \u201cSainte C\u00e9cile jouant sur l\u2019aile d\u2019un ch\u00e9rubin\u201d (Saint Cecilia Playing on an Angel\u2019s Wing), in which the material image of a viola has faded from a stained-glass window but has been replaced, as shafts of light radiate from the setting sun, by immaterial images: first of the feathers of an angel\u2019s wing and then, in a second mutation, by the strings of a harp on which the fingers of Saint Cecilia can create music, thus drawing sound from silence.\n\r\nMallarm\u00e9\u2019s desire to do likewise and to compose poetry evocative of the ideal world is only implicit in this poem, but in three sonnets that together form a single poem (written, in all probability, in 1866, although not published until 1887), he describes much more personally a spell of intense creative effort, lasting from dusk until dawn, although it ends in failure. In the first sonnet, \u201cTout Orgueil fume-t-il du soir\u201d (Just as the sun sets proudly behind the clouds at evening), the flame of fresh inspiration does not leap, as he had hoped, from the ashes of his abandoned, traditional kind of poetry; in the second sonnet, \u201cSurgi de la croupe et du bond\u201d (Surging up from the rounded base and rising flank), no rose springs from the vase that he imagines himself to be; in the third sonnet, \u201cUne dentelle s\u2019abolit\u201d (A lace curtain becomes invisible), his creative faculty, symbolized by the two images of a bed and a mandolin, fails to give birth to a new kind of poetry.\n\r\nMallarm\u00e9\u2019s correspondence from this period helps\u00a0explain his ideas. In a letter dated July 1866 he proclaims: \u201cJe suis mort et ressuscit\u00e9 avec la clef de pierreries de ma derni\u00e8re cassette spirituelle. A moi maintenant de l\u2019ouvrir en l\u2019absence de toute impression emprunt\u00e9e\u201d (I have died and have come to life again with the precious key to my final spiritual casket. It is now my task to open it without the aid of any borrowed impressions). In another letter,\u00a0written in May 1867, Mallarm\u00e9\u00a0developed this idea of not being dependent on impressions made by material objects, of being truly creative in the sense of no longer merely describing something that already exists. He\u00a0contends that he has become simply a kind of prism through which the light from the ideal world is refracted and transformed: \u201cJe suis maintenant impersonnel \u2026 une aptitude qu\u2019a l\u2019univers spirituel \u00e0 se voir et \u00e0 se d\u00e9velopper \u00e0 travers ce qui fut moi\u201d (I am now disembodied \u2026 \u00a0simply a means whereby the spiritual world can be made perceptible and can develop through what once was me). It is worth noting that in both of these letters,\u00a0Mallarm\u00e9, either by accident or design, makes of himself a Christlike figure, which further suggests he is concerned not with the material but with the immaterial world.\n\r\nBy 1867,\u00a0when he was only 25 years old, Mallarm\u00e9 had worked out what he wanted to do as a poet, and this goal was to remain unchanged throughout the rest of his life. Nearly 20 years later, in his preface to Ren\u00e9 Ghil\u2019s\u00a0Trait\u00e9 du Verbe\u00a0(Treatise on the Word, 1886), he said that his aim was to perceive, beyond a real flower, the ideal flower that can never be found in this world: \u201cJe dis: une fleur! et, hors de l\u2019oubli o\u00f9 ma voix rel\u00e8gue aucun contour, en tant que quelque chose d\u2019autre que les calices sus, musicalement se l\u00e8ve, id\u00e9e m\u00eame et suave, l\u2019absente de tous bouquets\u201d (I say: a flower! and, out of the oblivion into which my voice consigns any real shape, as something other than petals known to man, there rises, harmoniously and gently, the ideal flower itself, the one that is absent from all earthly bouquets). This point is made equally clearly in another phrase in the same preface, in which Mallarm\u00e9 contends that the whole purpose of poetry is to create ideal forms, unsullied by any contact with reality: \u201cLa notion pure, sans la g\u00eane d\u2019un proche ou concret rappel\u201d (pure concept, unlinked to any related or material form).\n\r\nDespite the obvious difficulty of using language for these creative purposes and not for what he scornfully called \u201creporting,\u201d Mallarm\u00e9 soon acquired a boundless confidence in his ability to achieve his goal. In 1868 he wrote the first version of the sonnet \u201cSes purs ongles tr\u00e8s haut d\u00e9diant leur onyx\u201d (The uplifted fingernails of an onyx figure), 13 lines of which emphasize the total emptiness of a room, which is then transformed, in the final line, into a vast, starlit universe. The work is symbolic both of Mallarm\u00e9 conjuring up ideal forms from the empty void and of his confidence that his period of sterility was over.\n\r\nThis same confidence is apparent in the companion sonnet, \u201cQuand l\u2019ombre mena\u00e7a de la fatale loi\u201d (When Failure Threatened to Destroy), which, although first published in 1883, undoubtedly dates from this period, 15 years earlier. It exhibits the same sudden transition from the dark and funereal confines of a closed room to the huge expanse of the night sky, although it occurs this time much earlier in the poem, at the beginning of the second quatrain, and leads to the confident declaration:\nOui, je sais qu\u2019au lointain de cette nuit, la Terre\r\nJette d\u2019un grand \u00e9clat l\u2019insolite myst\u00e8re\r\nSous les si\u00e8cles hideux qui l\u2019obscurcissent moins.\n\r\n(Yes, I now know that far into the night the Earth\r\nIs flinging a strange and mysterious shaft of light whose\r\nBrilliance will only be increased as the grim centuries pass by.)\nWhen, in the final line of the poem, Mallarm\u00e9 describes the earth as having been transformed into a shining star by the birth of his genius, the reader is reminded of the star of Bethlehem, thus continuing the implied analogy between the poet and Christ in the phrases from his letters of 1866 and 1867.\n\r\nSince Mallarm\u00e9 was convinced of his newfound ability to reveal a whole universe of ideal forms, one might have expected from him a sudden burst of poetic activity in 1868. The opposite was the case.\u00a0He wrote no new poems for five years, until the death of\u00a0Th\u00e9ophile Gautier\u00a0inspired \u201cToast fun\u00e8bre\u201d (Funeral Salute) in 1873. Then came a further silence of three years, broken by an invitation to write the \u201cTombeau de Poe\u201d (Elegy for Poe) in 1876 and, in the following year, on the occasion of the death of the wife of one of his friends, by the composition of \u201cSur les bois oubli\u00e9s quand passe l\u2019hiver sombre\u201d (When the dark days of winter pass over the forgotten woods). A\u00a0long silence of eight years followed before the publication of \u201cProse\u2014pour des Esseintes\u201d (Prose\u2014for des Esseintes) in 1885.\n\r\nSeveral factors could explain this extraordinary lull in Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s poetic production. His already strained finances were stretched further by his moves between teaching posts in Tournon to Besan\u00e7on in 1866, to Avignon in 1867, and to Paris in 1871, and by the birth of his son, Anatole, in the latter year. Presumably, his financial straits motivated to take on such surprising extra commitments as editing a few issues of a short-lived fashion magazine, publishing a language manual, and translating a treatise and a children\u2019s story from English into French. Besides undertaking these time-consuming tasks, Mallarm\u00e9 also published in these years his translation of poems by\u00a0Edgar Allan Poe, his poem\u00a0L\u2019Apr\u00e8s-midi d\u2019un faune, as well as a substantial article on his friend, the painter Edouard Manet.\nMallarm\u00e9 was also working on what he called his \u201cGrand Oeuvre\u201d (Great Work). The term signifies not only a magnum opus in the literary sense, but also, as Mallarm\u00e9 said in a letter dated May 1867, the secret formula sought by the alchemists of medieval times to transmute base metal into gold\u2014an obvious symbol of what Mallarm\u00e9 was seeking to achieve in his poetry.\n\r\nThe final reason for Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s unproductiveness lies in the nature of the task he had set himself. Creating ideal forms meant adopting a slow and elaborate process of avoiding overt description in favor of suggestion, allusion, and ambiguity so as not to become too closely tied to reality\u2014which explains why there are so many differences of opinion over the interpretation of his poems. In \u201cSes purs ongles,\u201d for example, the constellation of seven stars that rises in the northern sky in the final line of the poem is not named, nor indeed are the words\u00a0constellation\u00a0and\u00a0star\u00a0ever mentioned. Mallarm\u00e9 merely refers to a \u201cseptuor de scintillations\u201d\u2014seven glittering points of light created by himself and absent from any known sky. The rhymes contribute to the theme of ideal forms springing from an empty void, since only two rhymes are used throughout the poem:\u00a0-ix\u00a0and\u00a0-or, the first of which is the sound of the letter\u00a0x, the generally accepted symbol of the unknown, while the meaning of the second rhyme in French is \u201cgold,\u201d the equally accepted symbol of the ultimate ideal.\n\r\nSimilarly, in \u201cTout Orgueil fume-t-il du soir,\u201d the setting sun is never explicitly mentioned but is merely implicit in the torch of the second line, which swings down toward darkness. The fact that the torch is \u201c\u00e9touff\u00e9e\u201d (stifled) rather than extinguished suggests that the poem is really concerned with the poet falling silent. As in \u201cSes purs ongles\u201d the syllable\u00a0-or\u00a0plays a significant role, occurring three times in the first three lines\u2014in the words \u201corgueil,\u201d \u201ctorche,\u201d and \u201cimmortel\u201d\u2014thus suggesting the ideal toward which Mallarm\u00e9 is striving.He fails, however, to achieve his goal, as is implied by a further triple occurrence of the syllable\u00a0-or\u00a0in two despairing lines near the end of \u201cUne dentelle s\u2019abolit,\u201d the third sonnet of the trilogy: \u201cMais, chez qui du r\u00eave se dore / Tristement dort une mandore\u201d (But, despite the poet\u2019s golden dreams / within him a mandolin sadly sleeps).\nWhile Mallarm\u00e9 was patiently developing this complex technique, he was also reflecting on his basic belief that in the apparent emptiness of space an ideal world lies concealed\u2014that infinity can be conjured up from the void. An obvious variation on this theme is that eternal life can come from death, that when a man is reduced to nothingness he can nevertheless live on in some way. This concept is no doubt why Mallarm\u00e9 was attracted to the elegy, especially those addressed to artists, since they live in on their works even in death. \u201cToast fun\u00e8bre,\u201d \u201cLe Tombeau de Poe,\u201d and \u201cSur les bois oubli\u00e9s\u201d are therefore not purely occasional poems, but also closely related to Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s ideas.\n\r\nJust as he had proclaimed in \u201cQuand l\u2019ombre mena\u00e7a\u201d that his own genius would shine more and more strongly through the centuries, so he claims on Gautier\u2019s behalf in \u201cToast fun\u00e8bre\u201d that \u201cle splendide g\u00e9nie \u00e9ternel n\u2019a pas d\u2019ombre\u201d (the splendid, eternal genius shall never be shrouded in darkness), and, on Poe\u2019s behalf, in the often quoted opening line of the \u201cTombeau de Poe,\u201d that death has finally changed the poet into the eternal artist rather than the mortal man: \u201cTel qu\u2019en lui-m\u00eame enfin l\u2019\u00e9ternit\u00e9 le change\u201d (Transformed at last into his true self by death). Even in \u201cSur les bois oubli\u00e9s,\u201d although the poem is not addressed to a creative artist, emphasis is laid in the moving final lines on the power of the word, which is able to bring the dead wife back from the grave:\nAme au si clair foyer tremblante de m\u2019asseoir,\r\nPour revivre il suffit qu\u2019\u00e0 tes l\u00e8vres j\u2019emprunte\r\nLe souffle de mon nom murmur\u00e9 tout un soir.\n(I am a soul longing to sit beside the bright hearth, and\r\nTo be brought back to life; all I need is to hear from your lips\r\nThe murmur of my name repeated throughout the night.)\nThe poem with which Mallarm\u00e9 broke his virtual poetic silence of 17 years in January 1885 bore the enigmatic title \u201cProse\u201d and was dedicated to Floressas des Esseintes, the decadent hero of J.K. Huysmans\u2019s novel\u00a0A Rebours\u00a0(Against Nature, 1884). For the over-refined tastes of des Esseintes the prose poem was the supreme literary form, and it may be for this reason that Mallarm\u00e9, tongue in cheek, decided to call what is clearly a poem in verse: \u201cProse\u2014pour des Esseintes.\u201d Otherwise, however, the poem has a serious purpose, for it is a renewed declaration by Mallarm\u00e9, parallel to his overconfident declaration 17 years before, in \u201cQuand l\u2019ombre mena\u00e7a de la fatale loi,\u201d that his period of silence is now over, that he has at last perfected his technique of conjuring up the ideal world, that his \u201cGrand Oeuvre\u201d is finally to see the light of day:\nGloire du long d\u00e9sir, Id\u00e9es\r\nTout en moi s\u2019exaltait\r\nDe voir la famille des irid\u00e9es\r\nSurgir \u00e0 ce nouveau devoir.\n(This was the glorious culmination of what I had longed for, those ideal flowers that I had sought, and my heart leaped within me to see the whole family of the flowers of the goddess Iris rise up in their turn at the prospect of my accepting the task of revealing their existence.)\nWhile Mallarm\u00e9 was writing \u201cProse,\u201d he was also yielding to the charms of M\u00e9ry Laurent, the former mistress of, among others, the painter Edouard Manet, who had died in April 1883. Setting aside his promise in \u201cProse\u201d to at last set down on \u201ceternal parchment\u201d his vision of the ideal world, he exchanged the role of poet for that of lover and to abandon his dreams of glory in favor of the pleasures to be found in M\u00e9ry\u2019s company:\nNon! La bouche ne sera s\u00fbre\r\nDe rien go\u00fbter \u00e0 sa morsure\r\nS\u2019il ne fait, ton princier amant,\nDans la consid\u00e9rable touffe\r\nExpirer comme un diamant\r\nLe cri des Gloires qu\u2019il \u00e9touffe.\n(No! My mouth cannot be sure\r\nOf fully savoring its kisses\r\nUnless your princely lover\nFinally stifles his dreams of glory\r\nBurying them like a diamond\r\nIn the great mass of your hair.)\nSimilarly, in \u201cVictorieusement fui le suicide beau\u201d (Triumphantly abandoned now my one-time ambition to die in splendor), a first version of which was sent to Verlaine at the end of 1885, and in \u201cM\u2019introduire dans ton histoire\u201d (When I first entered your life), published in June 1886, he is only too delighted to give up burning the midnight oil working at his \u201cGrand Oeuvre\u201d in favor of spending his nights with M\u00e9ry.\n\r\nIn 1885 as in 1868, Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s optimistic declaration of faith in his ability to attain his ideal world was followed by a failure to do so. This time, however, instead of lapsing into silence, he wrote and published poems about M\u00e9ry Laurent, reflecting the successive stages of their relationship, which gradually changed from the sensuality of \u201cQuelle soie aux baumes de temps,\u201d \u201cVictorieusement fui le suicide beau,\u201d and \u201cM\u2019introduire dans ton histoire,\u201d with its deliberately equivocal opening line, through the almost fraternal tenderness of \u201cO si ch\u00e8re de loin\u201d (You are so dear to me even from afar), the fading desire of \u201cMes bouquins referm\u00e9s sur le nom de Paphos\u201d (Having closed the book I have been reading about Paphos) and the spent passion of \u201cLa chevelure vol d\u2019une flamme\u201d (Her hair was once like a leaping flame) to the \u201camiti\u00e9 monotone\u201d (placid friendship) of the final line of the last poem of the cycle, \u201cDame sans trop d\u2019ardeur\u201d (Lady, without excess of ardor), dated January 1, 1886.\n\r\nThese love poems are of considerable merit and are typically Mallarmean in their technique\u2014\"La chevelure vol d\u2019une flamme\u201d crams into the 14 lines of the sonnet an equal number of words evocative of the radiance of M\u00e9ry\u2019s red hair and of M\u00e9ry herself, while \u201cO si ch\u00e8re de loin\u201d compares her to an ideal nonexistent perfume evoked by an extraordinary accumulation of negatives: \u201c\u2026 \u00a0quelque baume rare \u00e9man\u00e9 par mensonge / Sur aucun bouquetier de cristal obscurci\u201d (\u2026 \u00a0Some perfume so rare that it has never been given off / By any bouquet of flowers in an invisible crystal vase). Yet they clearly mark a turning away from the ideal world toward the world of reality. Not surprisingly Mallarm\u00e9 experienced the inevitable reaction and felt a certain tinge of regret that he had failed to carry out his promise, a regret that was all the more acute because he was then well over 40 and in failing health, so that his chances of taking up his task once more and carrying it through to completion were becoming increasingly slim.\u00a0\n\r\nHis regret is most strongly expressed\u00a0in the 1886 elegy to Wagner, who had died in 1883. He called it \u201cHommage\u201d rather than \u201cTombeau\u201d and acknowledged that Wagner had succeeded where he had failed, and that the ideas metaphorically gathering dust in the corners of his mind would never see the light of day: \u201cLe silence d\u00e9j\u00e0 fun\u00e8bre d\u2019une moire / Dispose plus qu\u2019un pli seul sur le mobilier\u201d (The funereal silence of a shroud is already beginning / To spread its folds over the contents of my mind).\n\r\nPerhaps because of this mood of pessimism, which must have been increased by the death of his son in 1879, of Wagner and Manet in 1883, and of\u00a0Victor Hugo\u00a0in 1885, feeling that his own life was nearing its end\u2014although he would live for 12 more years\u2014Mallarm\u00e9 collected the poems he had so far published in\u00a0literary magazines and produced two volumes in 1887,\u00a0Album de vers et de prose\u00a0and\u00a0Les Po\u00e9sies de St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9.\n\r\nBy 1893, however, he had recovered some of his optimism in the sonnet at first titled \u201cToast\u201d (since it was recited as such to his friends at a literary banquet) and later \u201cSalut,\u201d in which he once more reaffirmed his faith in his goal. But this time he defines the latter in no more than the vaguest terms. Instead of the overwhelming confidence of \u201cQuand l\u2019ombre\u201d and \u201cProse\u201d that he will reach his goal, Mallarm\u00e9 now feels uncertain whether his legacy will be success, failure, or some lonely limbo between the two.\nThe same is true of the sonnet published in the magazine\u00a0Pan, 1895, \u201cA la nue accablante tu\u201d (Unannounced to the lowering cloud), in which Mallarm\u00e9 expresses an uncertainty of a rather different kind, not about his ultimate fate, but about the true worth of what he has achieved. He now seems convinced that his work will never survive, but in a moment of unusually profound pessimism he also wonders whether this outcome will mean the loss to posterity not of a great poet, but of a mere versifier.\n\r\nUncertain and despondent though he may have felt at times during these years, Mallarm\u00e9 nevertheless recovered sufficiently from his pessimism on occasions to write elegies to Baudelaire in 1895, to Verlaine in 1897 and to Vasco da Gama in 1898. This last poem, \u201cAu seul souci de voyager\u201d (To life\u2019s sole goal of sailing onwards) was written to celebrate the 400th anniversary of da Gama\u2019s voyage to India, but Mallarm\u00e9 also saw, in the great explorer\u2019s persistence in sailing into the unknown against all odds, an image of his own unwavering pursuit of the ideal world, despite disappointments and setbacks.\n\r\nThis acceptance of the \u201csouci de voyager\u201d (goal of the traveler) as a substitute for the more ambitious \u201csouci d\u2019arriver\u201d (goal of arrival) can also be perceived in what is no doubt the most original and hermetic of all Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s works,\u00a0Un coup de d\u00e9s jamais n\u2019abolira le hasard.\u00a0So as to indicate the structure of this fairly lengthy and extremely complex piece of prose made up of some 650 words covering 21 pages, Mallarm\u00e9 uses different kinds of lettering. The main clause, printed in bold capitals, is interrupted after \u201cjamais\u201d by a subordinate clause in smaller capitals, which, in turn, is interrupted by a long and intricate passage in ordinary roman type. Only after these two parentheses does the verb \u201cn\u2019abolira\u201d appear, and it too is followed by a long parenthesis in italics before the object of the verb, \u201cle hasard,\u201d makes its appearance. A final qualifying clause is then introduced, first in italics and then in roman type, to bring the work to a close.\n\r\nIn addition to this visual indication of the relative emphasis to be given to the various sections of the text,\u00a0Un coup de d\u00e9s jamais n\u2019abolira le hasard\u00a0also has a pictorial element. The words and sentences are sparingly and unevenly distributed across the double page, which Mallarm\u00e9 uses as his \u201cframe\u201d instead of the single page, so that the lines of print, sometimes trailing across the paper like a drawing of the wake of a ship, sometimes grouped together like black dots on white dice (a wake is white; a drawing of it is black), and sometimes more widely scattered like black stars in a white sky, reinforce the three kinds of imagery that dominate\u00a0Un coup de d\u00e9s, much as the sounds\u00a0ix\u00a0and\u00a0or\u00a0complement the imagery of \u201cSes purs ongles.\u201d There is indeed a close relationship between these two works, although the optimism implicit in the constellation rising triumphantly out of the empty room in 1868 has given way almost 30 years later to a calm resignation implicit in a similar constellation quietly presiding over a catastrophic shipwreck.\n\r\nMallarm\u00e9\u2019s finds a twofold consolation for not having succeeded in producing his \u201cGrand Oeuvre\"; first in the thought that, even if he had launched this work upon the world, it could still have passed unnoticed, for the fact of throwing a pair of dice does not abolish the chance that they may not be seen; and second in that, even if the dice are not thrown, even if the \u201cGrand Oeuvre\u201d is not published, nevertheless the ideas that have gone into its making will themselves constitute a less obvious throw of the dice and may by chance survive. The final line, \u201cToute Pens\u00e9e \u00e9met un Coup de D\u00e9s\u201d (Every thought means a throw of the dice), is the modestly optimistic conclusion, printed in appropriately modest lettering, of this extraordinarily original and complex work.\n\r\nNow that more than a century has elapsed since Mallarm\u00e9 wrote those words as the final line of\u00a0Un coup de d\u00e9s, it seems safe to say that the hope they express has been realized, and that, even though he did not manage to complete and to publish his \u201cGrand Oeuvre,\u201d the works he did publish have ensured him a place as one of the brightest stars in the constellation of writers who make the second half of the 19th century such a brilliant period in French literature.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"]}}
