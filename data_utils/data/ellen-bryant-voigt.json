She earned a BA from Converse College and an MFA from the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. Her many poetry collections include Headwaters (2013), Messenger: New and Selected Poems 1976\u20132006, and Shadow of Heaven (2002).\nVoigt studied piano when she was a child, not turning to poetry until a friend in college introduced her to poems by\u00a0E.E. Cummings\u00a0and Rainer Maria Rilke.\u00a0She stated in a Vermont Public Radio interview that music influences her writing \u201centirely.\u201d She went on to explain, \u201cI primarily write by my ear. I write by sound first, and then I have to go back and ... press on every word and figure out the structure of what is being said rather than how it\u2019s being said, but there\u2019s no question to me that sound is the generative force. ... [Poetry] does its work through music which then allows for exploration of ... complicated and therefore accurate feelings.\u201d\nVoigt\u2019s poems often traverse the worlds of motherhood, the rural South, family, and music. Poet\u00a0Edward Hirsch\u00a0wrote of her early book,\u00a0Claiming Kin\u00a0(1976), that Voigt\u2019s work demonstrates \u201ca Southerner\u2019s devotion to family and a naturalist\u2019s devotion to the physical world.\u201d\u00a0Her collection\u00a0Kyrie\u00a0(1995),\u00a0which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle award, is a book-length sonnet sequence exploring the lives of people affected by the influenza epidemic of 1918\u20131919.\u00a0She is also the author of The Art of Syntax: Rhythm of Thought, Rhythm of Song\u00a0(2009) and the editor of\u00a0The Flexible Lyric\u00a0(1999), a collection of essays on the craft of poetry. With Heather McHugh\u00a0she coedited\u00a0Hammer and Blaze: A Gathering of Contemporary American Poets (2002), and with\u00a0Gregory Orr\u00a0she coedited\u00a0Poets Teaching Poets: Self and the World\u00a0(1996).\nVoigt was a founder of the Goddard College low-residency MFA program, the first MFA program of its kind, and has also taught at Iowa Wesleyan College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She served as poet laureate of Vermont for four years, and\u00a0as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets from 2003 to 2009.\u00a0She has received grants from the NEA and the Guggenheim Foundation, and\u00a0in 2015 she was awarded a MacArthur fellowship. She\u00a0has lived in Vermont for many years.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"]}}
