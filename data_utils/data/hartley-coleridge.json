Although he was the subject of two of his father\u2019s poems\u2014\u201cFrost at Midnight\u201d and \u201cThe Nightingale\u201d\u2014Coleridge was nonetheless estranged from his parents in his youth and raised by the poet Robert Southey. Coleridge attended Oxford and received a fellowship to Oriel College. A bright student who was expected to excel, he struggled with alcoholism and was eventually expelled from Oriel, forcing him to forfeit his fellowship.\nColeridge subsequently moved to London, where he worked as a private tutor and published poems in the London Magazine. Influenced by William Wordsworth\u2019s poetry, Coleridge excelled at composing sonnets and published a short collection, Poems (1833). The book received a promising reception, as did Coleridge\u2019s collection of author biographies, Biographia Borealis; or Lives of Distinguished Northerns (1833). Coleridge\u2019s writings also included an incomplete drama, Prometheus.Hartley Coleridge lived his final years in the countryside. His remaining manuscripts were published posthumously in Essays and Marginalia (1851).\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Romantic"]}}
