An itinerant laborer, union organizer, and \u201ctroubadour of discontent,\u201d some of his songs became labor movement anthems.\nAfter immigrating to the United States in 1902, Hill became involved with the Industrial Workers of the World, or the Wobblies, who sought to uplift all workers into \u201cone big union.\u201d His songs were incorporated into the Wobblies\u2019 Little Red Song Book, becoming quite popular. His biographer, Franklin Rosemont, argues that people were drawn to the \u201csimplicity of Hill's lyrics, the innocence of heart that they communicate along with their radical defiance, their solidarity with the oppressed, their love of freedom, and their bright vision of a new and happier society.\u201d His music influenced a generations of protest musicians, including Pete Seeger, Paul Robeson, and Joan Baez. In 1914, he was accused of murdering a former police officer and his son in Salt Lake City, Utah. Despite a lack of evidence connecting Hill to the crime, he was convicted and executed by firing squad in 1915. Hill\u2019s final message to IWW General Secretary Bill Haywood has become, in a distilled form, a rallying cry for activists: \u201cDon\u2019t waste any time in mourning\u2013\u2013organize.\u201d He was executed by firing squad in 1915.\n", "attrs": {}}
