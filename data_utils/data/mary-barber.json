The wife of a clothier and mother of four children, she lived in Dublin and enjoyed the patronage of Jonathan Swift. While marriage, motherhood, friendship, education, and other domestic issues are her central themes, they frequently lead her to broader, biting social commentary.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Ireland & Northern Ireland"], "School/Period:": ["Augustan"]}}
