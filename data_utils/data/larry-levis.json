In his youth, he worked on his father\u2019s vineyard. In 1968, he earned a BA from Fresno State College, where he studied with Philip Levine.\u00a0He completed a master\u2019s degree at Syracuse University in 1970; there, he and his peer Stephen Dunn\u00a0studied under the poet Donald Justice. In 1974, Levis earned a PhD at the University of Iowa. He is the author of several poetry collections, including The Dollmaker\u2019s Ghost (1981), winner of the Open Competition of the National Poetry Series; The Afterlife (1977), which won the Lamont Poetry Prize; and Wrecking Crew (1972), which received the United States Award from the International Poetry Forum.\u00a0Levis taught at the University of Missouri, the University of Utah, and the Warren Wilson College MFA Program for Writers. \nLevis often employed an imagist or surrealist approach in his work. As Diane Wakoski wrote in Contemporary Poets, Levis\u2019s \u201cwork is best when the poems are short and are shaped by his imagist instincts or his gestures towards surrealism. He is a master of the brief moment of recognition where the personal is embedded in the generic \u2026 and the least effective when he allows nostalgia to reign over or shape his poems.\u201d\n\u201cThe landscapes in which I live always have a powerful and direct, although often delayed, effect on my poetry,\u201d Levis once explained to Contemporary Authors. Among Levis\u2019s personal sources of inspiration are his childhood experiences surrounded by migrant workers at his family\u2019s farm and his time during college when he was exposed to tough, violent, and crude people while working as a janitor in a steel mill. However, as Levis said, \u201cthe most important landscape, for me, is that of my childhood: the central valley of California.\u201d\n\u201cLevis\u2019s first book, Wrecking Crew, includes poems on war, rape, discrimination, death, and wasted lives,\u201d Steven M. Wilson explained in the Dictionary of Literary Biography. \u201cHowever, little of the book suggests solutions to the troubles; the book is more an existentialist\u2019s litany of America\u2019s cruelty.\u201d \u201cHe describes the book as \u2018overtly political,\u2019\u201d the critic continued, \u201cand he does deal with the major concerns of his day, but his decision to \u2018witness\u2019 leaves the reader ultimately disappointed by what could be seen as artistic cowardice.\u201d \u201cUnlike later works,\u201d Wilson recognized, the \u201cWrecking Crew poems are short\u2014often very short\u2014relying on calculated understatement and the connecting of concretely described images (a sort of exhausted imagism), often explained by the use of simile. \u2026 [Levis]\u00a0had not yet found the technique that best suited his poetic philosophy.\u201d\nLevis explained to Contemporary Authors that he made changes to his concept of poetry through time, especially after the publication of his first book: \u201cMy themes have changed since Wrecking Crew. The poems are far less overtly political, and, in The Afterlife, much more personal. By personal I do not mean \u2018confessional\u2019 at all. I mean the creation of a private, familial mythology which intends to be representative rather than idiosyncratic.\u201d According to Wilson, critics recognized that \u201cThe Afterlife is evidence of a maturing writer. Behind the poems of this collection is someone who has begun to trust the leaps of logic and imagery provided by his intuition, and a reader is better able to follow the narrator of each poem as he struggles to find meaning in a chaotic world. \u2026 Levis\u2019s later poetry [is] an unexpected pleasure, as he moves beyond experimentation into an artistry and insight of the best kind.\u201d\nLevis continued to mature as a poet throughout the 1980s. In his essay expounding on Levis\u2019s growth as a poet, Wilson commented, \u201cIn [The Leopard\u2019s Mouth Is Dry and Cold Inside] are the beginnings of an important feature of Levis\u2019s work: he uses his poetry and imagination to reach into other people\u2019s lives and find symbols there.\u201d \u201cThe value Levis discovers in poetry, then,\u201d the critic continued, \u201cseems to be its ability to illustrate the similarities of all people. \u2026 There is moving clarity of vision in The Dollmaker\u2019s Ghost, and Levis\u2019s technical abilities have matured, resulting in a volume that contains his best writing to that point.\u201d Wilson has similarly complimentary remarks about Levis\u2019s later works: \u201cWinter Stars, even though it concerns the death of Levis\u2019s father, is finally an affirmation of the ability of the poet and his art to rejuvenate the soul. The Widening Spell of the Leaves is a journey through moments from the poet\u2019s life that have taken on symbolic or personal importance, and that lead him through a sometimes dizzying maze of images and meanings as he explores the uses of intuition and personal history in reaching an understanding and acceptance of human existence.\u201d\n\u201cAs Levis \u2026 progressed and \u2026 [drew] more heavily from his experiences,\u201d Wilson summarized, \u201chis work [took] on greater depth and eloquence, so that in later books many poems are self-referential but are also moving, insightful meditations on living. Levis uses his life, but also looks outside himself and beyond the events he remembers to find connections with broader truths. Thus he is an important figure in contemporary American poetry, both as a highly decorated practitioner of a style and philosophy many see as the dominant method of poetry in recent decades and as a writer who considers, with at times artistic brilliance, the issues involved in being human.\u201d\nLevis died in Richmond, Virginia on May 8, 1996.\n", "attrs": {}}
