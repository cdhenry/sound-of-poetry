{"pf_url": "https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/brandon-som", "name": "Brandon Som", "yob": "1975", "yod": null, "image": null, "bio": "\nBorn in Phoenix, Arizona, Brandon Som earned a BA from Arizona State University, an MFA from the University of Pittsburgh, and a PhD from the University of Southern California. He is the author of Babel\u2019s Moon (Tupelo, 2011), winner of a Snowbound Chapbook Award, and The Tribute Horse (Nightboat, 2014), winner of a Nightboat Poetry Prize and Kate Tufts Discovery Award. The Tribute Horse explores the story of Chinese immigrants like Som\u2019s grandfather, who circumvented the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act in 1928 by falsely claiming kin with Chinese Americans. In a review of The Tribute Horse, Meriwether Clarke writes, \u201cReaders of Som\u2019s book are implicitly forced to remember the discrimination nineteenth- and twentieth-century Chinese immigrants faced. \u2026 The desire to hold the past and present in the same handful, to marry where one is going with where one has come from, speaks to Som\u2019s delicate representation of the inner turmoil of immigrant experience.\u201d\nSom\u2019s poetry appears in Barrow Street, Indiana Review, Black Warrior Review, McSweeney\u2019s, and elsewhere. He has taught at Chatham University, New York University, and the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Young Writers Institute.\n", "attrs": {}}
