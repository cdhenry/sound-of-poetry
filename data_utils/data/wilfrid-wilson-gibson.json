With the advent of Modernism, writers such as T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and William Carlos Williams advanced the possibilities of poetry in entirely new directions. Due to the dynamic breakthroughs and overwhelming public nature of the Moderns, certain poetic movements of this same time period have often been overlooked. And thus Eliot, Pound, and Williams are household names, while Wilfrid Wilson Gibson, a leader of the Georgian movement of poetry, is not.\r\n\u00a0\r\nModernism, however, is a broad phenomenon to describe. In fact, Georgian poetry is at times included within the boundaries of Modernism. Yet Georgian poetry and, for example, Pound\u2019s Cantos, could not be more disparate in style, content, and form. As Susan Millar Williams explained in Dictionary of Literary Biography: \u201cThe unifying thrust of the movement was toward realism and \u2018sincerity,\u2019 and against humanism, academicism, the romantic-Victorian tradition, and the decadence of the fin de siecle.\u201d The movement was dubbed \u201cGeorgian\u201d because George was the current monarch; this was an attempt to mark the poetry as contemporary.\r\n\u00a0\r\nGibson is often recognized as a leader of the Georgian movement. Born in 1878, he grew up in northern England and received his education privately. The Queen\u2019s Vigil, and Other Song, Gibson\u2019s first book of poems, was published when he was only 24. The poet produced a fairly prolific body of work over the next 40 years. Originally, his poetry was charged with much of the fanciful material found in the works of English poets Algernon Charles Swinburne and Alfred Lord Tennyson. However, Gibson abandoned extravagance for an honest, realistic approach to life in the modern age. This shift in literary ideology, traced to his 1907 volume The Stonefolds, marks him as one of the early heralds of a new way of writing. He was soon included in the anthology Georgian Poetry, which first appeared in 1912. As Georgian poetry caught on, so did Gibson, and he regularly contributed to poetry periodicals of his day.\r\n\u00a0\r\nGibson\u2019s poetry was characterized by an acute examination of the commonplace. His poems often focus on the lives of the working class. This, again, was based on the idea of making poetry more honest and accessible to everyone\u2019s experience. His fascination with the industrial workers, the circus people, the farmers, and the policemen increased as he developed his craft in the 1920s and 1930s. Critics did not always respond well to Gibson\u2019s literary shifts. Pearl Strachan, writing in the Christian Science Monitor, declared: \u201cDeliberately choosing the commonplace for subject, and in that following some of the best of examples, he has, alas, failed to raise expression beyond the commonplace.\u201d In contrast, a contributor to the Times Literary Supplement remarked: \u201cHe is in close touch with the simple, elementary feelings of humanity; and by associating these with pathetic, peculiar, or heroic incidents in the lives of working folk he achieves truth and poignancy by what seems only to be faithful description.\u201d Conrad Aiken, who contributed reviews to Dial, also offered praise, remarking that \u201cMr. Gibson has clearly proved that poetry can deal with the commonplaces of daily life,\u2014with the bitter and trivial and powerful and universal commonplaces of human consciousness,\u2014and do it with force and beauty.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nGibson\u2019s poetry was greatly influenced by his experiences during World War I. Having been denied entry into the army for several years due to his poor eyesight, Gibson was finally allowed to become a soldier in 1917. Two years later he was injured, and left the battlegrounds. His wartime experience recognizably leaked into his poetry, and dominates whole editions of his work. A reviewer for the Boston Transcript commented on Gibson\u2019s battle poems: \u201cThey are nothing more than etchings, vignettes, of moods and impressions, but they register with a burning solution on the spirit what the personal side of the war means to those in the trenches and at home.\u201d A critic for the Survey, in a laudatory review of Gibson\u2019s book Battle, stated: \u201cUnder the impact of the greatest crisis in history, he has been not stunned to silence or babbling song, but awakened to understanding and sober speech, and thereby has proved his genius.\u201d Another collection, titled Fuel and published almost 20 years after Battle, contains poems on such subjects as industry, the city, and the sea. A Nation reviewer provided a mixed review of the volume, asserting that \u201cFuel has all the virtues and all the faults of the better grade of Georgian verse.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nGibson has also been noted for his interest in bridging drama with verse. Though did not invent the form, the fact that Gibson attempted to write in this manner in the modern age reveals his willingness to experiment with form and style. Williams quoted Gibson in a letter to a fellow poet John Drinkwater: \u201c\u2018I am not much drawn to theatre as a medium of expression... . I am intensely interested in poetic drama; and I feel confident that poetic drama is the art of the future\u2014only I feel that whatever gift I have is more suited to make its appeal from the intimate pages of a book than from the boards of a theatre.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Georgian"]}}
