Ammons was born in rural North Carolina on February 18, 1926. His experiences growing up on a cotton and tobacco farm during the Great Depression inspired a great deal of his poetry. Ammons wrote his first poems while serving aboard a Navy destroyer during World War II. After the war, he earned a BA from Wake Forest University and an MA in English from the University of California at Berkeley. He taught at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York from 1964 to 1998. Ammons\u2019s many honors include two National Books Awards, a National Book Critics Circle Award, the Library of Congress\u2019s Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry, and the Bollingen Prize for Poetry. He is the author of numerous poetry collections, including Bosh and Flapdoodle (2005), Glare (1997), Garbage (1993), A Coast of Trees (1981), Sphere (1974), Collected Poems 1951-1971, Tape for the Turn of the Year (1965), and Ommateum: With Doxology (1955).\nAmmons once told the Winston-Salem Journal and Sentinel,\u00a0\u201cI never dreamed of being a Poet poet. I think I always wanted to be an amateur poet.\u201d But critics have long recognized Ammons as a major American poet, and the measure of their esteem is implied by the stature of the poets to whom they compare him. Tracing his creative genealogy, they are apt to begin with Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau and work chronologically forward through Walt Whitman, Ezra Pound, Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, and William Carlos Williams. Of those poets, Harold Bloom felt that the transcendentalists Emerson and Whitman have influenced Ammons the most. In his book The Ringers in the Tower: Studies in Romantic Tradition, Harold Bloom contended that \u201cthe line of descent from Emerson and Whitman to the early poetry of Ammons is direct, and even the Poundian elements in [Ammons\u2019s poem] \u2018Ommateum\u2019 derive from that part of Pound that is itself Whitmanian.\u201d \u201cOmmateum\u201d refers to an insect\u2019s compound eye, and presages the inclusiveness that marks Ammons\u2019s canon and the works of earlier transcendentalists.\nDaniel Hoffman, writing in the New York Times Book Review, agreed that Ammons\u2019s poetry \u201cis founded on an implied Emersonian division of experience into Nature and the Soul,\u201d adding that it \u201csometimes consciously echo[es] familiar lines from Emerson, Whitman and Dickinson.\u201d While inheriting both the emancipation from strict metrical forms won by Emerson and the multiplicity of alternatives recognized by Whitman, Ammons brings to poetry a fidelity to the details of nature and a contemporary, conversational tone, thus revitalizing a significant portion of traditional American literature. According to Bloom, Ammons \u201cilluminates Emerson and all his progeny as much as he needs them for illumination.\u201d\nWhile they acknowledged Ammons\u2019s debt to other writers, reviewers found that he had forged a style that was distinctly his own. Jascha Kessler wrote in Kayak, \u201c[Ammons] makes his daily American rounds about lawn and meadow, wood, hill, stream, in an easy, articulate, flat, utterly uneventful expository syntax. Altogether unlike Thoreau\u2019s sinewy, exacting, apothegmatic prose, and unlike that suavely undulant later [Wallace] Stevens from whom he borrows some of his stanza structures or envelopes, transmogrifying the Master of Imagination into a freshman-text writer who uses the colon for endless, undigestible linkages, never daring Stevens\u2019 comma, or venturing Thoreau\u2019s period.\u201d Other critics joined Kessler in objecting to Ammons\u2019s sparse punctuation, but David Kirby defended Ammons, writing in the Times Literary Supplement that \u201chis short lines, his overall brevity, his avoidance of punctuation marks other than the occasional comma and that quick stop-and-go colon are hallmarks of his minimalism, his exquisitely unencumbered technique.\u201d\nPeter Stevens maintained that Ammons\u2019s punctuation and form serve his intents well in some cases, poorly in others. Writing in the Ontario Review, Stevens argued that the \u201congoing flux\u201d in Tape for the Turn of the Year\u2014a long poem composed on an adding machine tape\u2014works as \u201can almost perfect method to allow his notion of organic form to function,\u201d but that \u201cno such wedding of form and content\u201d occurs in another long poem, Sphere: The Form of a Motion. In the latter work, said Stevens, \u201cthe looseness that Ammons believes in derives from the use of a form the poet has tried before. [The poem is] written in three-or four-line stanzas. ... Breathing space is provided by commas and colons only. Such a form fits snugly into Ammons\u2019 concern with flux and motion, and yet somehow the form seems too arbitrary.\u201d\nIn his work, Ammons focuses on change both in nature and in daily life. In the poems \u201cCascadilla Falls,\u201d \u201cThe Wide Land,\u201d \u201cPoetics,\u201d and many others, Ammons articulates the tension between the individual\u2019s sense of self as bound to particulars of space and time, and the sense of self as part of a larger continuum\u2014an identity man learns from nature. William Logan noted in the Chicago Tribune Book World that in these interests, Ammons\u2019s work is \u201creminiscent of Frost on one side and Williams on the other, and in the work of both men, as in the [some] dozen books of their heir, intellect copes with its surroundings.\u201d According to Robert Shaw in Poetry, Ammons does more than describe; he forces the reader to involve himself. \u201cThe interest in an Ammons poem,\u201d Shaw wrote, \u201cis less in the thing perceived than in the imaginative effort of the perceiver.\u201d Richard Howard explained further in Alone with America: Essays on the Art of Poetry in the United States since 1950 that \u201cAmmons rehearses a marginal, a transitional experience[;] he is a literalist [sic] of the imagination because the shore, the beach, or the coastal creek is not a place but an event, a transaction where land and water create and destroy each other, where life and death are exchanged, where shape and chaos are won and lost.\u201d This is clearly depicted in \u201cCorson\u2019s Inlet\u201d (published in Collected Poems, 1951-1971), a loosely formed poem where line lengths vary in order to imitate \u201cthe few sharp lines\u201d and \u201cthe disorderly orders\u201d of nature, according to the poet. While acknowledging that any poem lends an order to its materials, the poet celebrates \u201cthat there is no finality of vision, / that I have perceived nothing completely, / that tomorrow a new walk is a new walk.\u201d Collected Poems won Ammons his first National Book Award in 1973.\nM.L. Rosenthal felt that although Ammons shares Wallace Stevens\u2019s desire to intellectualize rather than simply describe, he falls short of Stevens\u2019s success. Rosenthal wrote in Shenandoah, \u201cAmmons does have certain advantages over Stevens: his knowledge of geological phenomena and his ability to use language informally and to create open rhythms. ... What he lacks as compared to Stevens, is a certain passionate confrontation of the implicit issues. ... There is a great deal of feeling in Ammons; but in the interest of ironic self-control he seems afraid of letting the feeling have its way [as Stevens does].\u201d Partisan Review contributor Paul Zweig agreed that \u201cunlike [T.S.] Eliot or Stevens, Ammons does not write well about ideas.\u201d Zweig felt that \u201conly when his poem plunges into the moment itself does it gain the exhilarating clarity which is Ammons\u2019\u00a0best quality.\u201d Zweig asserted that Ammons\u2019s strength is in his form. \u201cAt first glance,\u201d he wrote, \u201cAmmons ... seems to be a maverick, working vigorously against the limitations of the plain style. ... Yet his best poems are closer to the plain style than one might think. It is when one hears William Carlos Williams in the background of his voice that the poems work clearly and solidly.\u201d\nThough shorter than the poems in his other books, those in A Coast of Trees: Poems are remarkably inclusive. Robert Phillips wrote in the Hudson Review that the volume contains some of the poet\u2019s best work. The poem \u201cRapids,\u201d for example, begins \u201cwith a case for the superiority of autumn over spring and end[s] in the nature of the universe 100-million years from now\u2014all within 12 lines!\u201d Helen Vendler, writing in the New Republic, called the poem \u201cEaster Morning\u201d \u201ca new treasure in American poetry, combining the blankest of losses with the fullest of visions.\u201d Of the other poems in the book, she wrote, \u201cThe poems enable us to watch this poet going about the business of the universe, both its \u201clost idyllic\u201d and its present broken radiance. He has been about this business for years now, but I notice in reading this new collection how much more secure his language has become. ... Now the scientific world in Ammons is beautifully in balance with the perceptual one, and the tone is believably, and almost perfectly, colloquial.\u201d Phillips concluded, \u201cIn this tidy book there is less abstraction, more people, and a continuation of Ammons\u201d explorations of light, color and radiance. It is a fine place to begin for any reader not yet familiar with this poet who is determined to capture the shape and flow of the universe and to untell its dreams. \u201cThough some critics gave the book negative reviews, others gave it high praise. A Coast of Trees: Poems was nominated for the National Book Award and won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1982.\nSumerian Vistas (1988)\u00a0further develops the theme of transcendental unity found in Ammons\u2019s other work. In many poems that address the writing process, the poet relates that writing is an ordering process while nature is a continuum in flux. Alice Fulton commented in a Poetry review, \u201cPoetry and epitaphs are seen as efforts to fix time, while nature is read as a script of motion, a text of regeneration. ... Sumeria is invoked [in the title] as a metaphor of inception. It was there that writing first developed, and antiquity serves as a backdrop for explorations of beginning and closure, of generative cycles.\u201d The relationship between time and flux, the personal and the nonpersonal, the holy and the profane are explored in these poems. At times, these polarities meet and paradoxically remain in balance; Ammons\u2019s metaphor for these times is \u201ca ridge ... a line where two upward sloping surfaces meet,\u201d said Fulton. As in his other poems, Ammons points out the comforting aspects of nature. Fulton observed, \u201cNature consoles because it has designs without having designs on us. In fact, Ammons goes to nature precisely because it lets him \u2018miss anything personal / in the roar of sunset.\u2019 In contrast to human cruelty, which frightens since it is \u2018like one\u2019s own mercilessness,\u2019 nature\u2019s cruelty is mitigated by its impersonality.\u201d\n\u201cThough Ammons\u2019s vistas do not deny age ... his tone has not changed: it still has the spring and backlash and curiosity of his young voice,\u201d Helen Vendler commented in the New Yorker. She added that the poet\u2019s distinctive voice accounts for the success of these poems. \u201cIt is Ammons\u2019s entrancing Southern storytelling voice that carries us along in his narratives of natural fact,\u201d she said, referring to a long poem about finding a dead mole in a neglected watering can. The poem begins, \u201cI noticed last fall\u2019s leaves in the / can and thought well that will improve / the juice but I thought it did smell / funny.\u201d When the narrator finds the dead mole under the leaves, he says, \u201cmercy: I\u2019d just had / lunch: squooshy ice cream: I nearly / unhad it.\u201d Vendler commented, \u201cThere has been nothing like this in American poetry before Ammons\u2014nothing with this liquidity of folk voice.\u201d\nCritics find echoes of other poetic voices in Ammons\u2019s Sumerian Vistas. David McDuff observed in Stand, \u201cTaking W.C. Williams\u2019 dictum [\u2018No ideas but in things\u2019] one step further, Ammons shows that things may possess the quality of ideas, and ideas those of things.\u201d In short statements called \u201cTombstones,\u201d the poet sees \u201cthrough layers of memory, emotion and experience to reveal the spiritual cohesion that lies behind the observed reality, and the elemental forces that unite the animate and inanimate phenomena of the world with the processes of human existence.\u201d The reviewer also saw a connection between the poems in Sumerian Vistas and Robinson Jeffers\u2019s vision of sinful man fallen from grace, yet Ammons emphasizes man\u2019s place as a part of nature and the poet\u2019s role as \u201can interpreter of the cosmic will.\u201d\nBloom suggested in his The Ring in the Tower that while readers may indeed hear other voices in the background, Ammons\u2019s poems are uniquely valuable because of the personal voice that not only borrows from but also adds to the poetic tradition. Bloom wrote: \u201cAmmons\u2019s poetry does for me what Stevens\u2019s did earlier, and the High Romantics [Bloom\u2019s term for William Blake, William Wordsworth, Samuel Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, and Lord Byron] before that; it helps me to live my life. If Ammons is, as I think, the central poet of my generation, because he alone has made a heterocosm, a second nature in his poetry, I deprecate no other poet by this naming. ... He has emerged as an extraordinary master, comparable to the Stevens of Ideas of Order and The Man with the Blue Guitar.\u201d Bloom concluded that as one tracks Ammons through the body of his work, one finds \u201cby not only a complete possibility of imaginative experience, but by a renewed sense of the whole line of Emerson, the vitalizing and much maligned tradition that has accounted for most that matters in American poetry.\u201d\nAmmons\u2019s concerns with the transcendental everyman coalesce in what may prove to be his finest effort: the National Book Award winner of 1993, Garbage. The title, suggested when Ammons drove by a Florida landfill, is characteristically flippant and yet perfectly serious. \u201cGarbage is a brilliant book,\u201d said David Baker in the Kenyon Review. \u201cIt may very well be a great one. ... perhaps even superior to his previous long masterwork, Tape for the Turn of the Year.\u201d Once again evoking an Emersonian view of nature, Baker noted, \u201cAmmons discovers that nature everywhere is composed of the decadent and entropic, the aged, the tired,\u201d and also shows that matter transforms and renews itself, turning \u201cgarbage into utility, decay into new life.\u201d As Robert B. Shaw pointed out in Poetry, however, Ammons\u2019s transcendent meditations are always seasoned with \u201cjokes, slang, ironies, Li\u2019l Abnerisms.\u201d\nElizabeth Lund of the Christian Science Monitor criticized Ammons for his tendency to jump \u201cunexpectedly from one image or idea to another.\u201d And yet this very disjointedness may be a strength, suggested David Kirby in his Southern Review essay, since Ammons\u2019s poetry \u201cdoes not communicate everything it finds\u201d and because poetry in general \u201cis less subject than fiction to a demand for clarity.\u201d It is even through the illogical ideal of \u201cnot making sense,\u201d Kirby argued, that Ammons is able to communicate \u201cunder the world of sameness ... what is different.\u201d New York Times reviewer Edward Hirsch articulated what may be the consensus regarding Garbage. He saw the poem as a brilliant summation of the poet\u2019s life work, \u201can American testament that arcs toward praise, a poem of amplitude that confronts our hazardous ends and circles around to saying, \u2018I\u2019m glad I was here, / even if I must go.\u2019\u201d\nBrink Road contains more than 150 poems, many about nature. Booklist reviewer Donna Seaman called it a \u201cgrand collection\u201d and concluded by saying that Ammons \u201chas a Zen point of view and a voice that harmonizes well with e.e. cummings and Robert Frost.\u201d \u201cThe poems present us with many bright descriptive and meditative passages,\u201d wrote Ashley Brown in World Literature Today. \u201cEach poem is a sentence deployed through short unrhymed stanzas, which readers familiar with Ammons\u2019s earlier books will recognize.\u201d Brown felt that \u201cSummer Place,\u201d a poem of more than 1,000 lines describing one day in 1975, is reminiscent of John Ashbery: \u201cIt presents the reader with a thoroughly enjoyable and sustained view of a poet who is sometimes a bit solemn.\u201d A Publishers Weekly reviewer said \u201cSummer Place\u201d contains \u201cenough humor and sarcasm to make it fun.\u201d America reviewer Edward J. Ingebretsen called the poems \u201csinuous and surprisingly pared to the moment. ... Many, perhaps most ... seem focused away from any kind of collectivity; they are meditative rather than narrative. ... In Ammons\u2019s Miltonian sense of things, we are east of Eden, and welcome.\u201d\nIn Poetry, Christian Wiman reviewed Ammons\u2019s long poem Glare (1997), saying that \u201cmuch of it, particularly after the first fifty pages or so, is simply a kind of disposable poetry, not without its casual pleasures\u2014the cleverness, the nimble wordplay and associative progressions of each section\u2014but neither requiring nor rewarding much sustained attention.\u201d Ingebretsen wrote, \u201cHis topics are desultory, sometimes leading to serendipity, other times to banality\u2014sometimes both, pointedly.\u201d The poem is in two parts, titled \u201cStrip\u201d and \u201cScat Scan.\u201d Library Journal contributor Rochelle Ratner compared the longest section to Garbage. \u201cHe wants \u2018Strip\u2019 to be akin to litter, however, casually strewn everywhere,\u201d said Ratner, who called the volume \u201cessential.\u201d A Publishers Weekly contributor wrote that \u201csome of this work is witty, and some of it slaps a reader with a bracing metaphysical humor.\u201d\nMichael Graber, writing in the Commercial Appeal, said that \u201cwe are taken to a mall, a church, a school, the scene of a drive-by shooting, to black holes and more, all though the eyes of an unrelenting witness with an obsessive mind that tries to make meaning out of anything but ends up settling for laughter.\u201d\nAmmons died on February 25, 2001, at the age of 75. Franklin Crawford wrote Ammons\u2019s obituary for the Cornell Chronicle, calling him \u201cquite literally, a modern poetical phenomenon. His influence over American letters is immeasurably profound, and, while his style may inspire comers of every stripe, his literary accomplishments are not likely to be duplicated in our time or any other.\u201d In the same article, former Cornell provost Don Randel, now president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, wrote of his friend\u2019s passing: \u201cArchie Ammons once began a poem by saying, \u2018Nothing\u2019s going to become of anyone except death.\u2019 He was right, as usual, and right in the same poem to urge us in the face of this fact to \u2018drill imagination right through necessity.\u2019 But in that opening line, he was in an important way also wrong about himself. For what has become of Archie is also that he has given many of us the words with which we will continue to think about nature, art, death, life, and a good deal else. By this method he will outlive us all.\u201d\n", "attrs": {}}
