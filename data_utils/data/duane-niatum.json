At age 17, Niatum joined the Navy and was stationed in Japan. He earned a BA from the University of Washington, where he studied with\u00a0Theodore Roethke\u00a0and\u00a0Elizabeth Bishop, an MA from Johns Hopkins University, and a PhD in American culture from the University of Michigan.\r\n\u00a0\r\nNiatum's writing is deeply connected with the Northwest coast landscape, its mountains, forests, water and creatures. The legends and traditions of his ancestors help shape and animate his poetry. He has published numerous collections of poetry, including\u00a0Ascending Red Moon Cedar\u00a0(1974);\u00a0Song for the Harvester of Dreams\u00a0(1980), which won the Before Columbus Foundation\u2019s American Book Award; and\u00a0Drawings of the Song Animals: New and Selected Poems\u00a0(1991). \u00a0His more current books of poetry are The Crooked Beak of Love (2000), The Pull of the Green Kite (2011), Agate Songs on the Path of Red Cedar (2011) and Earth Vowels (2017).\n\r\nIn a review of\u00a0The Crooked Beak of Love\u00a0(2000) for\u00a0Raven Chronicles, scholar David L. Moore observed, \u201cNiatum\u2019s intense love poems, so wrapped in an individual consciousness, tend toward tragedy, whereas his poems of nature and culture, striving for a voice rising on the wind in the cedars of his ancestors, tend toward reconciliation of history and promise.\u201d\n\r\nA former editor for Harper & Row\u2019s Native American Authors series, Niatum also edited the Native American literature anthologies\u00a0Carriers of the Dream Wheel\u00a0(1975) and\u00a0Harper\u2019s Anthology of Twentieth Century American Poetry (1988). His own poetry has been widely anthologized and translated into more than a dozen languages.\u00a0Several of his essays on American Indian literature and art have been published in the U.S. and Europe.\r\n\u00a0\r\nNiatum\u2019s honors include residencies at the Millay Colony for the Arts and Yaddo, the Governor\u2019s Award from the State of Washington, and grants from the Carnegie Fund for Authors and the PEN Fund for Writers.\u00a0He was four times nominated for a Pushcart Prize and\u00a0received\u00a0the 2017 Lifetime Achievement Award from Native Writers Circle of the Americas, Returning the Gift.\n\r\nNiatum lives in Seattle and has taught at Evergreen State College, the University of Washington, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Pacific Lutheran University and Western Washington University,\u00a0as well as area high schools.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
