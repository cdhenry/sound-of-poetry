He attended Eastman School of Music in Rochester before transferring to Haverford College to study literature. In the early 1980s, Baker worked as a technical writer before concentrating on fiction; his novels include The Mezzanine (1988), Room Temperature (1990), Vox (1992), The Fermata (1994), A Box of Matches (2003), and The Anthologist (2009). Baker\u2019s novels are varied in their styles and subject matter. He has focused on situations and topics as diverse as the details of a lunch break (The Mezzanine), the feeding of an infant (Room Temperature), phone sex between strangers (Vox), and the minutiae of a man\u2019s life (A Box of Matches). In a 1996 review in the New York Times, Michiko Kakutani observed that \u201cMr. Baker is a connoisseur of the minute, the particular, the specific. He is a reader of footnotes, a consulter of dictionaries, a student of concordances.\u201d In The Anthologist, Baker\u2019s main character is a poet attempting to write an introduction for an anthology of poetry. David Orr, reviewing The Anthologist for the New York Times, noted, \u201csomehow Nicholson Baker has written a novel about poetry that\u2019s actually about poetry\u2014and that is also startlingly perceptive and ardent, both as a work of fiction and as a representation of the kind of thinking poetry readers do.\u201d Baker is the author of the nonfiction collections U and I: A True Story (1991), about John Updike; The Size of Thoughts: Essays and Other Lumber (1996); and Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper (2001). His interest in preservation led him to become the director of the nonprofit American Newspaper Repository to store old newspapers destined for the dump. Baker lives in South Berwick, Maine.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
