In a 2008 interview, Gibbons describes Creatures of a Day as \u201ca book about chance encounters, the testing of one\u2019s sense of the world that is produced by encounters with other people,\u201d a depiction that speaks to one of Gibbons\u2019s major concerns, that of poetry\u2019s role in the lives of others. Over the course of his career, Gibbons has focused increasingly on social and political injustice, and the power and responsibility that writers have to engage their society and effect change. Poet Tony Hoagland describes Gibbons\u2019s recent work as \u201cbig, rich, meticulous, thoughtful canvases, social landscapes with personal and metaphysical shadows.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\r\nHe has been awarded the Folger Shakespeare Library\u2019s O.B. Hardison Jr. Poetry Prize and the John Masefield Award from the Poetry Society of America. He has received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Fulbright Program, and the National Endowment for the Arts. Gibbons was the editor of TriQuarterly magazine from 1981 to 1997, during which time he co-founded and edited TriQuarterly Books. He has also been a columnist for The American Poetry Review.\n\r\nThe editor of numerous anthologies, including The Poet\u2019s Work (1979) and Triquarterly New Writers (1996), Gibbons has been represented in Best American Poetry and the Pushcart Prize anthology. Gibbons has also published short stories and critical essays as well as translations of Spanish and Mexican poetry and ancient Greek tragedy.
