Grossman occupies a unique position in contemporary American letters: though influenced by the modernism and postmodernism that shaped so many poets of his generation, Grossman did not align himself with any one poetic community. Instead, his poetry is often described as coming out of the modern Romantic tradition of lyric poetry, and he writes in a high style, reflecting the influence of William Butler Yeats, Wallace Stevens, and Hart Crane. According to the late poet and critic Reginald Shepherd, \u201cGrossman shares the Romantic and High Modernist exalted idea of the poet\u2019s vocation and of the power of poetry to engage and encompass the world on equal terms \u2026 Though his poetry is not devoid of irony or even humor, Grossman is never embarrassed or ironic about the greatness he believes poetry to be capable of making apparent, nor about his own ambitions to approach such greatness, although in his view its attainment is impossible: to write the perfect poem would be to reach the end of poetry.\u201d\u00a0A noted scholar, Grossman\u2019s book\u00a0The Sighted Singer: Two Works on Poetry for Writers and Readers (1992), which he wrote with Mark Halliday, remains a kind of cult classic of poetics. The work addresses the philosophical implications of lyric poetry and\u00a0lays out Grossman\u2019s own understanding of the nature of poetic address.\nGrossman was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He earned his BA and MA from Harvard and his PhD from Brandeis University in 1960. He taught for many years at both Brandeis, where he was the Paul E. Prosswimmer Professor of Poetry and General Education;\u00a0and Johns Hopkins University, where he was the Emeritus Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities. His many honors and awards included a MacArthur Foundation \u201cGenius\u201d Award, the Bassine Citation of the Academy of American Poets, the Witter Bynner Prize for Poetry from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, a nomination for the National Book Critics Circle Award for his book\u00a0The Ether Dome\u00a0(1992), and, in 2009, the prestigious Yale Bollingen Prize. He also served as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Science.\nInvested in lyric poetry\u2019s impulse to embody experience precisely, Grossman\u2019s poetry also displays a distrust of its ability to fix feeling accurately. In books like A Harlot\u2019s Hire (1962) and The Woman on the Bridge over the Chicago River (1979), Grossman began to formulate his poetics in poems that were at once narrative and philosophical. Grossman\u2019s The Ether Dome was described by critic William Doreski for the Literary Review as representing \u201ca long devotion to poetry not as a quasi-career but as a way of understanding the world.\u201d Grossman\u2019s later work has also received praise for its continued devotion to exploring the intersections of poetry, philosophy, and autobiography. In the Boston Review, James Longenbach described How to Do Things with Tears (2001) as Grossman\u2019s \u201cwildest creation yet.\u201d The material in this book, Longenbach claimed, could have filled ten books. Though the poems are \u201cstuffed with characters, voices and idioms,\u201d there is a unifying voice, Longenbach wrote, that makes a singular statement: \u201cPoetry is what we do with memories, and remembering is what we do with tears.\u201d In Descartes\u2019 Loneliness (2007), Grossman imaginatively inhabits the figure of Descartes and the precepts of his philosophy, penning letters to Princess Elizabeth. However, the book is also concerned with Grossman\u2019s own family history. As Publisher\u2019s Weekly noted, these more personal lyrics showcase Grossman\u2019s \u201cinterest\u2014or better, faith\u2014in poetry\u2019s capacity to perform distinctly human acts of preservation.\u201d\nCritic Geoffrey Hartman wrote,\u00a0\u201dGrossman\u2019s poems, a continuous act of confrontation, brave comparison with verses that today are sacred\u00a0as\u00a0verse, untouchable in their strength.\u201d Scholar Robert Fitzgerald added,\u00a0\u201cThe reader who takes up these poems will appreciate at once the altogether distinctive beauty of lines and phrases \u2026 falling as unlaboredly on the page as light falls through a framing window on a wall.\u00a0 The prosodic or musical achievement is itself a rare one amid the poetries of the time, and like most fine art comes of long study and the intense exercise of choice.\u201d\nGrossman died in Chelsea, Massachusetts in 2014.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
