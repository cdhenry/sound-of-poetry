The hallmarks of his style are precise language, surreal imagery, and the recurring theme of absence and negation; later collections investigate ideas of the self with pointed, often urbane wit. Named the US poet laureate in 1990, Strand\u2019s career spanned five decades, and he won numerous accolades from critics and a loyal following among readers. In 1999 he was awarded the prestigious Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his collection Blizzard of One.\nBorn on Prince Edward Island, Canada, Strand grew up in various cities across the United States and in Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Strand originally expressed interest in painting and hoped to become an artist. He earned a BA from Antioch College in 1957 and a BFA from Yale University in 1959, where he studied with the painter Josef Albers. His interest in painting waned while at Yale, and he then decided to become a poet instead. Following his graduation, he went to Italy on a Fulbright Scholarship and studied 19th-century Italian poetry. \u201cI was never much good with language as a child,\u201d Strand admitted during an interview with Bill Thomas for the Los Angeles Times Magazine. \u201cBelieve me, the idea that I would someday become a poet would have come as a complete shock to everyone in my family.\u201d Strand earned his MFA from the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop in 1962 and began teaching at various colleges, including Yale University, Princeton University, and Harvard University. He spent a year in Brazil in 1965 as a Fulbright lecturer. Strand admitted there were some benefits to being a poet during the turbulent 1960s. \u201cGroupies were a big part of the scene,\u201d he told Thomas. \u201cPoets were underground pop stars, and when we made the campus circuit, girls would flock around. It wasn\u2019t bad. I rather liked the uncertainties of my life then.\u201d\nStrand\u2019s first book, Sleeping with One Eye Open (1964), introduced his distinctive approach to poetry. The volume is characterized by a pervasive sense of anxiety and restless foreboding. Discussing the title poem with the radio program, Weekend America, Strand said the poem \u201cspeaks to a certain anxiety I experienced back in the early \u201960s. I was afraid the United States would go to war with Russia or the USSR. I think it\u2019s a poem surrounded by a great deal of silence.\u201d In the first stanza of the frequently anthologized poem \u201cKeeping Things Whole,\u201d Strand sets the tone and presents the themes which continue to dominate his later work: \u201cIn a field / I am the absence / of field. / This is / always the case. / Wherever I am / I am what is missing.\u201d Just before his death in 2014, Strand asserted that he wrote this poem in 20 seconds during a card game.\nThe speakers in Strand\u2019s early poetry are characterized by an intense concern with self and identity. David Kirby remarked in Mark Strand and the Poet\u2019s Place in Contemporary Culture, \u201cMany poems in Strand\u2019s first book show an uneasy preoccupation with self, and the vehicle used to express that preoccupation is often a dream state in which the speaker is divided between two worlds and can locate himself comfortably in neither.\u201d The concern with identity is woven through Strand\u2019s later work, as well. \u201cThe basic themes are treated in the poems with a growing unease that the reader feels more intensely than before\u2014as his skill increases, so does the poet\u2019s power to disturb,\u201d Kirby explained.\nStrand\u2019s early collections of poetry, including Reasons for Moving (1968), made his reputation as a dark, brooding poet haunted by death, but Strand himself does not find them \u201cespecially dark,\u201d he told Thomas. \u201cI find them evenly lit,\u201d he continued. Critics, however, discerned a shift with Strand\u2019s third book. Harold Bloom, reviewing Darker (1970) found that \u201cthe irreality of Borges, though still near, is receding in Darker, as Strand opens himself more to his own vision.\u201d \u201cThe New Poetry Handbook,\u201d included in that book, illuminates Strand\u2019s slight shift in perspective. While many of the poems that follow it express a concern with the apparent meaninglessness of life, \u201cThe New Poetry Handbook\u201d offers a solution: poetry. Strand seriously considers the place of poetry in the universe, concluding that when \u201ca man finishes a poem / he shall bathe in the blank wake of his passion / and be kissed by white paper.\u201d Kirby viewed the poem as an answer to the problem of self. But while Strand\u2019s focus grew to include an affirmation of the positive, he remained \u201ca poet of mood, of integrated fragments, of twilit landscape, and of longing,\u201d wrote Henri Cole in Poetry. His collections The Story of our Lives (1973) and The Late Hour (1978) also \u201cwere dark, occupying the Rilkean space between beauty and terror. His ominous, foreboding early poems carry the anxiety of what cannot be communicated because it cannot be known, only anticipated,\u201d wrote Dave Lucas in the Virginia Quarterly Review, though they also include more obviously autobiographical poems like \u201cElegy for my Father.\u201d In 1980\u2019s Selected Poems, Strand relies on an \u201cethereal, cumulative effect\u201d to express the idea that \u201cthe two fixed points of a man\u2019s life are the self and God; both are darknesses, one leading to another,\u201d Cole continued. In the New York Review of Books, Irvin Ehrenpreis, however, was critical of Strand\u2019s solipsistic emphasis on the self: \u201cFor all his mastery of rhythm and music, Strand does not open the lyric to the world but makes it a self-sustaining enterprise.\u201d\nStrand spent the decade after the publication of Selected Poems not writing poetry. In a profile by Jonathan Aaron, Strand admitted that \u201cI gave up [writing poems] that year. I didn\u2019t like what I was writing, I didn\u2019t believe in my autobiographical poems.\u201d He turned to other forms of writing instead, including a foray into children\u2019s literature with The Planet of Lost Things (1982). As with his poetry, Strand focused on questions of loss, using the story to address the common childhood worry about where things go when they are lost. Strand\u2019s other books for children include The Night Book (1985) and Rembrandt Takes a Walk (1986). A frequent contributor of short stories to periodicals, Strand published a collection of prose narratives in 1985. The resulting volume, Mr. and Mrs. Baby (1985), addressed Strand\u2019s recurrent concern with the superficiality of life. Alan Cheuse of the Los Angeles Times Book Review described the book as \u201ca mixture of irony and affection.\u201d The collection mixes the fantastic with the mundane; describing the stories as \u201codd, surrealistic sketches of alienation and rootlessness,\u201d New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani found them \u201cso slight, so tentative, that they evaporate into the air.\u201d Ellen Lesser of the Village Voice wrote, \u201cBy far the greatest pleasures of Mr. and Mrs. Baby are not to be found in its mysteries, comic vision, or even its hapless picture of the contemporary male, but rather in the writing. On practically every page, one can be dazzled by Strand\u2019s language.\u201d\nStrand also published books of art criticism, including The Art of the Real (1983) and William Bailey (1987). His 1994 volume Hopper was a highly expressive elucidation of the technique and \u201cnarrative\u201d meaning of the American realist painter Edward Hopper\u2019s works. \u201cOf the many pieces of writing stimulated by Hopper,\u201d observed John Updike in The New York Review of Books, \u201cnone is more coolly and eerily attentive (more Hopperesque, we could say) than Mark Strand\u2019s brilliant small book Hopper, showing how we are moved and disquieted by formal elements in the paintings. Strand describes Hopper\u2019s human subjects, for example, as \u2018characters whose parts have deserted them and now, trapped in the space of their waiting, must keep themselves company with no clear place to go, no future.\u2019\u201d\nStrand published The Continuous Life, his first book of poems in a decade, in 1990. In the New York Times Book Review, Alfred Corn commented that the book \u201cdoesn\u2019t strike me so much as a capstone of Mr. Strand\u2019s career as one more turning in his development.\u201d Corn pointed to changes in meter, diction and point of view. \u201cThis is a poetry written, as it were, in the shadow of high mountains, and touched with their grandeur,\u201d he concluded. Strand\u2019s appointment as US poet laureate the same year brought the book even more attention. Strand\u2019s next books received much critical acclaim. Dark Harbor (1993) is a single long poem divided into 55 diverse sections. Reviewers emphasized the poem\u2019s motifs of anticipation and tension lacking resolution, as well as the exotic and rarified beauty of Strand\u2019s often surrealistic language, though Judith Hall, in the Antioch Review, found that the austerity of the \u201csequence is eased by tone\u2014elegiac and self-mocking; part Cheever, part Brancusi, with \u201cthe indefiniteness\u201d that Poe said was essential to music.\u201d In 1999 Strand was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for Blizzard of One. The collection returns to the same concerns that have preoccupied Strand throughout his career as a poet. \u201cThe poems in Mark Strand\u2019s latest collection are missing their subjects,\u201d wrote Sarah Manguso in the Iowa Review, pointing out the presence of familiar Strand themes of loss, dispersion and absence. For many critics Blizzard of One was an affirmation of Strand\u2019s continued appeal. A Publishers Weekly reviewer concluded that it was somehow \u201cscandalous\u201d that in his \u201cgorgeous, unabashed nostalgia or erotic melancholy\u201d there remained a tremendous allure and that Strand continued to be \u201cone of our most deeply enjoyable poets.\u201d In The New York Times, Deborah Garrison named Strand among the \u201cluminaries\u201d of contemporary poets, calling Blizzard of One a \u201cmasterly new collection\u201d in which \u201ceven the single snowflake that gives the volume its title ... is a kind of Platonic essence, linked to a continuum of snowflakes out there in the weather and inside, in the reader\u2019s consciousness.\u201d Garrison also found that \u201cin his serious verses there are glimmers of an appealing new lightness; it\u2019s as though his gradual adaptation to his own stringency has freed him up.\u201d\nWhen Strand published a collection of 15 short prose works as Weather of Words\u00a0(2000), he was commended for his insight into the work of other poets. The essays ranged from commentary on poets, analysis of individual poems, and a discussion of poetic forms. The book was also valued for its relevance to Strand\u2019s own poetry. Ian Tromp, writing in the Times Literary Supplement, compared the collection to Blizzard of One and found the poems \u201cpoised and subtle, imbued with wisdom,\u201d while the essays and prose were considered \u201cplayful and witty.\u201d Strand also coedited the anthology\u00a0The Making of a Poem: A Norton Anthology of Poetic Forms\u00a0(2000) with Eavan Boland.\nStrand\u2019s collection\u00a0Man and Camel (2006) contains more playful, witty moments than previous books, though, as Lucas pointed out in his VQR review, its \u201ctension, between what is present and what cannot be touched, continues to be the most consistent theme in Strand\u2019s work.\u201d New Selected Poems (2007) draws on Strand\u2019s work from the previous two decades and is full of \u201cbuffoons whom the poet nevertheless loves,\u201d wrote Dan Chiasson in the New Yorker, adding \u201cthey represent his new empathy for that old absurdity the self.\u201d His last book, Collected Poems (2014), was a longlist nominee for the National Book Award.\nIn his later years, Strand stopped writing poetry and began to work again in art, preferring to make collages with paper he made by hand. His work was exhibited at Lori Bookstein Fine Art in Chelsea.\u00a0\nMark Strand\u2019s honors include the Bollingen Prize, grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, a National Institute of Arts and Letters Award, a Rockefeller Foundation award, and fellowships from the Academy of American Poets, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Ingram Merrill Foundation. He served as a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. He taught at Johns Hopkins University, the University of Chicago, and Columbia University. He died in late 2014 at the age of 80.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
