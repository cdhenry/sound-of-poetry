But when the Swedish Academy awarded the Italian poet and critic the 1975 Nobel Prize for Literature, they called him \u201cone of the most important poets of the contemporary West,\u201d Publishers Weekly reported. Born in Genoa, Italy, in 1896, Montale had a long and distinguished career as a translator and critic in addition to his poetic achievements.\nAlong with Giuseppe Ungaretti and Salvatore Quasimodo, Montale is often named as one of the founders of the poetic school known as hermeticism, an Italian variant of the French symbolist movement. Montale himself, however, did not consider himself part of the hermetic school, and even questioned its existence. In his essay \u201cLet\u2019s Talk about Hermeticism\u201d (included in Galassi\u2019s anthology), he wrote: \u201cI have never purposely tried to be obscure and therefore do not feel very well qualified to talk about a supposed Italian hermeticism, assuming (as I very much doubt) that there is a group of writers in Italy who have a systematic non-communication as their objective.\u201d\nRather, Montale explained in his widely-quoted essay, \u201cIntentions (Imaginary Interview),\u201d \u201cI wanted my words to come closer than those of the other poets I'd read. Closer to what? I seemed to be living under a bell jar, and yet I felt I was close to something essential. A subtle veil, a thread, barely separated me from the definitive\u00a0quid.\u00a0Absolute expression would have meant breaking that veil, that thread: an explosion, the end of the illusion of the world as representation. But this remained an unreachable goal. And my wish to come close remained musical, instinctive, unprogrammatic. I wanted to wring the neck of the eloquence of our old aulic language, even at the risk of a counter-eloquence.\u201d\nIn his youth, Montale trained to be an opera singer. After serving in the infantry during World War I and the death of his voice teacher in 1923, Montale began to focus on writing poetry. He\u00a0had begun\u00a0writing poetry as a teenager, at the beginning of what was to be an upheaval in Italian lyric tradition. In the New York Review of Books, D.S. Carne-Ross described the artistic milieu in which Montale began his life\u2019s work: \u201cThe Italian who set out to write poetry in the second decade of the century had perhaps no harder task than his colleagues in France or America, but it was a different task. The problem was how to lower one's voice without being trivial or shapeless, how to raise it without repeating the gestures of an incommodious rhetoric. Italian was an intractable medium. Inveterately mandarin, weighed down by the almost Chinese burden of a six-hundred-year-old literary tradition, it was not a modern language.\u201d Not only did Italian writers of the period have to contend with the legacy of their rich cultural heritage, but they also had to deal with a more recent phenomenon in their literature: the influence of the prolific Italian poet, novelist, and dramatist, Gabriele D\u2019Annunzio, whose highly embellished style seemed to have become the only legitimate mode of writing available to them. \u201cMontale's radical renovation of Italian poetry,\u201d according to Galassi, \"was motivated by a desire to \u2018come closer\u2019 to his own experience than the prevailing poetic language allowed him.\u201d\n\r\nFor Montale coming close meant a private focus in his poetry that caused many critics to label his work as obscure or hermetic. Hermetic or not, Montale\u2019s poetry is difficult. Noting the demanding quality of Montale\u2019s work, Russian poet and critic Joseph Brodsky stated in a\u00a0New York Review of Books\u00a0essay that the \u201cvoice of a man speaking\u2014often muttering\u2014to himself is generally the most conspicuous characteristic of Montale\u2019s poetry.\u201d Many of Montale\u2019s poems are undiscernible to most casual readers, just as the meaning of the words of a man talking to himself is difficult for another to grasp. Problems in comprehension arise because Montale, in an effort to eliminate in his verse what\u00a0Parnassus: Poetry in Review\u00a0contributor Alfred Corn called \u201cthe merely expository element in poetry,\u201d sought not to talk about an occurrence in his poems but to simply express the feelings associated with the event. According to Corn, \u201cthis approach to poetic form allows for great condensation and therefore great power; but the poems are undeniably difficult.\u201d Montale\u2019s chief interpreter in recent years, Ghan Singh, examined Montale\u2019s poetic complexities in\u00a0Eugenio Montale: A Critical Study of His Poetry, Prose, and Criticism,\u00a0remarking: \u201cOf all the important twentieth-century Italian poets Montale is the one in whose case it is most difficult to proceed by explicating, through definite formulations and statements, what a particular poem is about. In other words, what comes out through the reading of the poem and what was in the poet\u2019s mind when he wrote it, seldom lend themselves to a condensed summary.\u201d\n\r\nIn\u00a0Three Modern Poets: Saba, Ungaretti, Montale,\u00a0Joseph Cary echoed the thoughts of other critics on Montale\u2019s verse in general while pointing in particular to the obscurity of Montale\u2019s\u00a0The Occasions. \u201cAs Montale himself has written,\u201d Cary observed, \u201cit is a short step from the intense poem to the obscure one. We are not talking of any grammatical-syntactical ellipsis here but of the nature of the poet\u2019s dramatic methods, his procedural assumptions. To be plunged, with minimal or no preparation,\u00a0in medias res,\u00a0which is to say, into the midst of an occasion dense with its own particular history, cross-currents, associations and emotional resonances, seems to me to be a fair description of the difficulties typically encountered in certain of the\u00a0Occasioni poems.\u201d\n\r\nCorn and Carne-Ross regard Montale\u2019s group of 20 brief poems, \u201cMotets\u201d (originally included in the collection 1939\u00a0The Occasions), as a leading example of Montale\u2019s condensed form of poetry. \u201cEven a hasty reading,\u201d wrote Carne-Ross, \u201creveals their singular formal mastery (they have been compared to Mallarme\u2019s octosyllabic sonnets); even a prolonged reading is often baffled by these impenetrable little poems. The images are always sensuously lucid \u2026 but they often point back to some \u2018occasion\u2019 which it is impossible to reconstruct, and as a result we do not know how to relate the images to each other or to the poem as a whole.\u201d Montale\u2019s technique in \u201cMotets\u201d is comparable to that used in the poetic sequence \u201cXenia\u201d (included in the English translation of\u00a0Satura: 1962-1970), written after the death of the poet\u2019s wife in 1963. Brodsky contended that in these later poems \u201cthe personal note is enforced by the fact that the poet\u2019s persona is talking about things only he and [his wife] had knowledge of\u2014shoehorns, suitcases, the names of hotels where they used to stay, mutual acquaintances, books they had both read. Out of this sort of\u00a0realia,\u00a0and out of the inertia of intimate speech, emerges a private mythology which gradually acquires all the traits appropriate to any mythology, including surrealistic visions, metamorphoses, and the like.\u201d\n\r\nThe image of a man talking to himself can be used not only to allude to the opaque quality of Montale\u2019s verse but also to refer to what, according to critics, is a dominant characteristic of his poetry, that of the poet talking to an absent other. So frequently did Montale address his poems to a female\u2014named or unnamed\u2014that John Ahern observed in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0that the reader could \u201csurmise that for Montale life, like art, was quintessentially speech to a woman.\u201d \u201cMotets\u201d and \u201cXenia,\u201d for example, are addressed to absent lovers; the first to Clizia, the second to his dead wife, known as \u201cla Mosca.\u201d Glauco Cambon studied the similarities and differences between the two sequences of poems in his\u00a0Books Abroad\u00a0essay on Montale in which Cambon referred to \u201cone central feature of Montale\u2019s style, the use of a sometimes unspecifiable Thou to elicit self-revelation on the part of the lyrical persona.\u201d Elsewhere in the same piece Cambon commented: \u201cObviously la Mosca fulfills in\u00a0Xenia\u00a0a function analogous to that of Clizia in \u2018Motets\u2019 and in various other poems from\u00a0Le Occasioni\u00a0and\u00a0La Bufera:\u00a0to provide a focal Thou that draws the persona out, to conquer his reticence about what really matters, to embody the unseizable reality of what is personal. Distance, absence, memory are a prerequisite of such polar tension, as they were for Dante and Petrarch. In Clizia\u2019s case distance is geographic, while in la Mosca\u2019s case it is metaphysical, being provided by death.\u201d\n\r\nCambon is only one of many critics who made a comparison between Montale and the great early 14th-century Italian poet, Dante. Singh, for example, observed \u201cMontale\u2019s use of Dante\u2019s vocabulary, style, and imagery.\u201d Both Arshi Pipa, who wrote a book-length study of Montale\u2019s resemblance to Dante entitled\u00a0Montale and Dante,\u00a0and Galassi concluded that one of the ways Montale was able to break with tradition and renovate Italian literature was by actually paying homage to that same tradition. \u201cMontale\u2019s solution to the problem of tradition, certainly one of the most successful solutions achieved by a poet in our century,\u201d Galassi explained, \u201cinvolved an innovative appropriation of the Italian literary past to serve his own very personal contemporary purposes. To Pipa, who sees Montale\u2019s relationship to Dante as the central issue in understanding this aspect of Montale\u2019s achievement in renewing Italian literature, \u2018he has continued tradition in poetry by recreating it, and this he has done by going back to its origin, where he has established contact with one who may well be called the father of the nation.\u2019\u201d\n\r\nWhen parallels are drawn between Montale and writers outside the Italian tradition, they are most often between Montale and T.S. Eliot. \u201cComparison between the two poets is inevitable,\u201d according to Galassi, \u201cfor both turn to a re-evaluation of tradition in their search for an authentic means of giving voice to the existential anxiousness of twentieth-century man.\u201d A London\u00a0Timeswriter observed that both poets possessed similar styles and \u201ca common predilection for dry, desolate, cruel landscapes.\u201d This tendency is evident in the poem, \u201cArsenio\u201d from\u00a0Ossi di seppia,\u00a0for example, which Carne-Ross called \u201cin a real sense Montale\u2019s\u00a0Waste Land,\u201d referring to one of Eliot\u2019s best-known poems. \u201cArsenio,\u201d like much of Montale\u2019s early work, depicts the rugged, tormented Ligurian coastline of Cinque Terre, the part of the Italian Riviera where Montale was born and to which he returned every summer of his youth. The starkness of the area can be seen in Mario Praz\u2019s translation of the first lines of \u201cArsenio,\u201d which appears in\u00a0The Poem Itself: \u201cThe whirlwinds lift the dust/ over the roofs, in eddies, and over the open spaces/ deserted, where the hooded horses/ sniff the ground, motionless in front/ of the glistening windows of the hotel.\u201d Praz maintained that the book\u2019s suggested \u201cthe dry, desolate purity of [Montale\u2019s] early inspiration: white cuttlefish bones stranded on the margin of the beach, where the sea casts up all its drift and wreckage. The white cuttlefish bones lie helpless among the sand and weeds; a wave every now and then disturbs and displaces them, giving them a semblance of motion and life.\u201d In this description of perceived motion or life amidst symbols of death critics find another relationship between \u201cArsenio\u201d and \u201cThe Waste Land.\u201d While both poems are filled with desolate description, they both also embrace a desire for redemption or rebirth.\n\r\nOther critics, such as Singh and Wallace Craft, see more differences between the two poets than similarities. In a\u00a0Books Abroad\u00a0essay on Montale published shortly after the poet won the Nobel Prize, Craft recognized that with similar intent Montale and Eliot both described nature as a series of fragmented images. The critic then went on to examine the dissimilarities between the two writers. \u201cBoth Eliot and Montale explored this fragmented world,\u201d observed Craft, \u201cin order to fathom the mystery of human life. It must be pointed out, however, that Eliot emerges from his existential wilderness or wasteland to find resolution in the framework of Christianity. Montale\u2019s quest, on the other hand, never leads to final answers. The fundamental questions regarding life, death and human fate posed in the early poetry are deepened, repeated but not resolved in later verse.\u201d Montale had no fascist sympathies. He was fired from his position at the the Gabinetto Vieusseux research library in 1939 for refusing to join the Fascist Party. \u00a0\n\r\nAlthough his poetry was largely responsible for Montale\u2019s worldwide fame, he received considerable critical attention in the United States with the posthumous publication of Galassi\u2019s translation of a compilation of his essays,\u00a0The Second Life of Art: Selected Essays of Eugenio Montale.\u00a0Even though in the last three decades of his life Montale came to be regarded\u2014mainly due to his position as literary editor for Milan\u2019s\u00a0Corriere della Sera\u2014\u201cas the Grand Old Man of Italian criticism,\u201d according to a London\u00a0Times\u00a0writer, this book of essays was one of the first collections of the Italian\u2019s critical prose to appear in English. Galassi saw these essays as both \u201cselections from an unwritten intellectual autobiography\u201d of Montale and \u201cthe rudiments of a context in which to view Montale\u2019s greatest work, his poetry.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Italy"]}}
