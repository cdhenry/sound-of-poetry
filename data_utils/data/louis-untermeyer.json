He will be best remembered as the prolific anthologist whose collections have introduced students to contemporary American poetry since 1919. The son of an established New York jeweler, Untermeyer\u2019s interest in poetry led to friendships with poets from three generations, including many of the century\u2019s major writers. His tastes were eclectic. In the\u00a0Washington Post, Martin Weil related that Untermeyer once \u201cdescribed himself as \u2018a bone collector\u2019 with \u2018the mind of a magpie.\u2019\u201d He was a liberal who did much to allay the Victorian myth that poetry is a highbrow art. \u201cWhat most of us don\u2019t realize is that everyone loves poetry,\u201d he was quoted by Weil as saying, pointing out the rhymes on the once-ubiquitous Burma Shave road signs as an example.\n\r\nUntermeyer developed his taste for literature while a child. His mother had read aloud to him from a variety of sources, including the epic poems \u201cPaul Revere\u2019s Ride\u201d and \u201cHiawatha.\u201d Bedtime stories he told to his brother Martin combined elements from every story he could remember, he revealed in\u00a0Bygones: The Recollections of Louis Untermeyer.\u00a0When he learned to read for himself, he was particularly impressed by books such as\u00a0Alfred\u00a0Lord Tennyson\u2019s Idylls of the King\u00a0and Dante\u2019s\u00a0Inferno.\u00a0Gustave Dore\u2019s illustrations in these books captivated him and encouraged his imagination toward fantasy. Almost 50 years later, Untermeyer published several volumes of retold French fairy tales, all illustrated by the famous French artist.\n\r\nIn addition to children\u2019s books and anthologies, Untermeyer published collections of his own poetry. He began to compose light verse and parodies during his teen years after dropping out of school to join his father\u2019s business. With financial help from his father, he published\u00a0First Love\u00a0in 1911. Sentiments of social protest expressed in the 1914 volume\u00a0Challenge\u00a0received disapproval from anti-communist groups 40 years later; as a result of suspicion, Untermeyer lost his seat on the \u201cWhat\u2019s My Line\u201d game show panel to publisher Bennett Cerf. During the 1970s, he found himself \u201cinstinctively, if incongruously, allied with the protesting young,\u201d he wrote in the\u00a0New York Times.\u00a0In the same article he encouraged the spirit of experiment that characterized the decade, saying, \u201cit is the non-conformers, the innovators in art, science, technology, and human relations who, misunderstood and ridiculed in their own times, have shaped our world.\u201d Untermeyer, who did not promote any particular ideology, remained a popular speaker and lecturer, sharing criticism of poetry and anecdotes about famous poets with audiences in the United States and as far away as India and Japan.\n\r\nUntermeyer resigned from the jewelry business in 1923 in order to give all his attention to literary pursuits. Friendships with\u00a0Robert Frost,\u00a0Ezra Pound, Arthur Miller, and other literary figures provided him with material for books. For example,\u00a0The Letters of Robert Frost to Louis Untermeyer\u00a0contains letters selected from almost 50 years of correspondence with the New England poet. The anthologist\u2019s autobiographies\u00a0From Another World\u00a0and\u00a0Bygones\u00a0relate as much about other writers as they do about his personal life.\u00a0Bygones\u00a0provides his reflections on the four women who were his wives. Jean Starr moved to Vienna with Untermeyer after he became a full-time writer; Virginia Moore was his wife for about a year; Esther Antin, a lawyer he met in Toledo, Ohio, married him in 1933; 15 years later, he married Bryna Ivens, with whom he edited a dozen books for children.\n\r\nIn his later years, Untermeyer, like Frost, had a deep appreciation for country life. He once told\u00a0Contemporary Authors: \u201cI live on an abandoned farm in Connecticut \u2026 ever since I found my native New York unlivable as well as unlovable. \u2026 On these green and sometimes arctic acres I cultivate whatever flowers insist on growing in spite of my neglect; delight in the accumulation of chickadees, juncos, cardinals, and the widest possible variety of songless sparrows; grow old along with three pampered cats and one spoiled cairn terrier; season my love of home with the spice of annual travel, chiefly to such musical centers as Vienna, Salzburg, Milan, and London; and am always happy to be home again.\u201d Untermeyer died in 1977.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
