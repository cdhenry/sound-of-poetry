In Soviet Russia, she was a member of a samizdat dissident group, which led to repeated arrests and difficulty publishing her work, so she immigrated to Jerusalem in 1990 and then to the United States in 1992.  \u00a0 Kapovich composes in both English and Russian. Her poems often take the shape of lyric narratives, incorporating elements of mythology and memory. In a 2010 interview with Marc Vincenz for Open Letters Monthly, Kapovich stated, \u201cWhen we are young, it\u2019s our passions that take command of us; we follow them fearlessly and sometimes win, because passions know shortcuts. That\u2019s been good enough for many years. Now it\u2019s experience and lots of thinking that I want to guide me and guard me. No more haste. In poetry hastiness is inappropriate. A lyrical poem is a small thing that can travel a long way. I slow myself down; I measure and weigh it in the palm again and again. Here\u2019s my only chance, I tell myself. I have one arrow, so it better be perfect.\u201d \u00a0 She is the author of several collections of Russian poetry, and her poetry in English includes Cossacks and Bandits (2008) and Gogol in Rome (2004). Her work has also been featured in the anthology Poetry 180: A Turning Back to Poetry (2003, edited by Billy Collins). \u00a0 With her husband, the poet Philip Nikolayev, she coedits Fulcrum: An Annual of Poetry and Aesthetics. She was awarded a Witter Bynner Fellowship from the Library of Congress and has served as poet-in-residence at Amherst College. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
