Stephanie Burt described\u00a0Or What We'll Call Desire  in The New York Times as \u201cpassionate, quirky, righteously outraged\u201d; Burt added, Teague \u201cmakes her long sentences into exuberant pageants, part sex appeal, part enduring outrage, and by no means devoid of comedy.\u201d She has also published the novel The Principles Behind Flotation (Skyhorse, 2017). With Brian Clements and Dean Rader, she coedited Bullets into Bells: Poets & Citizens\u00a0Respond to Gun Violence\u00a0(Beacon, 2017). \u200b\u200b\nTeague is the recipient of a 2019 Civitella Ranieri Foundation fellowship, the\u00a02014\u00a0Missouri Review\u00a0Jeffrey E.
