She earned both a BA and an MA from San Francisco State University. Gregg published many several collections of poetry, including\u00a0All of It Singing: New and Selected Poems (2008), a Los Angeles Times Favorite Book of 2008 and winner of the Poetry Society of America\u2019s William Carlos Williams Award; In the Middle Distance\u00a0(2006);\u00a0Things and Flesh (1999), finalist for the Kingsley Tufts Award for Poetry; Chosen by the Lion (1995); Sacraments of Desire (1992); Alma (1985); and Too Bright to See (1981). Gregg\u2019s lyrical poetry is often admired for its ability to discuss grief, desire, and longing with electrifying craftsmanship and poise. W.S. Merwin has praised Gregg\u2019s poems, observing, \u201cThey are original in the way that really matters: they speak clearly of their source. They are inseparable from the surprising, unrolling, eventful, pure current of their language, and they convey at once the pain of individual loss, a steady and utterly personal radiance.\u201d\nGregg won many awards, including the Whiting Writers\u2019 Award, the Sara Teasdale Award, the PEN/Voelcker Award for Poetry, the Jerome J. Shestack Poetry Prize, and numerous Pushcart Prizes. She has also been awarded a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the Lannan Literary Foundation.\n\r\nGregg taught at the University of Iowa, the University of California, Berkeley, and Princeton University. She lived in New York until her death in early 2019.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
