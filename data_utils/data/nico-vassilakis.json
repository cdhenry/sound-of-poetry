His visual and video poetry is composed of letters and phrase fragments that are swept or cut into shapes emphasizing their structural qualities and ephemeral nature. Referring to Vassilakis\u2019s visual poetry as \u201cless a work of grammar and words than an experiment with typography,\u201d the Stranger critic Paul Constant observed how he \u201cworks at the words, shoving them together and seeing what they do to each other when placed in close proximity.\u201dVassilakis\u2019s books include the poetry collection Disparate Magnets (2009) as well as the visual poetry book [email\u00a0protected] (2011). He collaborated with writer Friese Undine on Orange: A Manual (1997). Vassilakis edited Clear-Cut: Anthology: A Collection of Seattle Writers (1996),\u00a0The Last Vispo Anthology: Visual Poetry 1998-2008 (2012), and has served as coeditor of Sub Rosa Press. In 1994, he founded the Subtext Reading Series in Seattle, Washington. He currrently lives in New York City with his wife, poet Crystal Curry, and their sons.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
