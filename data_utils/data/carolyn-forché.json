According to Joyce Carol Oates in the New York Times Book Review, Forch\u00e9\u2019s ability to wed the \u201cpolitical\u201d with the \u201cpersonal\u201d places her in the company of such poets as Pablo Neruda, Philip Levine, and Denise Levertov.\n\r\nAn articulate defender of her own aims as well as the larger goals of poetry, Forch\u00e9 is perhaps best-known for coining the term \u201cpoetry of witness.\u201d In her ground-breaking anthology, Against Forgetting: Twentieth-Century Poetry of Witness (1993), Forch\u00e9 described the difficulties of politically-engaged poetry: \u201cWe are accustomed to rather easy categories: we distinguish between \u2018personal\u2019 and \u2018political\u2019 poems\u2026The distinction\u2026gives the political realm too much and too little scope; at the same time, it renders the personal too important and not important enough. If we give up the dimension of the personal, we risk relinquishing one of the most powerful sites of resistance. The celebration of the personal, however, can indicate a myopia, an inability to see how larger structures of the economy and the state circumscribe, if not determine, the fragile realm of the individual.\u201d Calling for a new poetry invested in the \u201csocial,\u201d Forch\u00e9\u2019s anthology presented poets who had written under extreme conditions, including war, exile, and imprisonment. The anthology solidified her place as one of America\u2019s most important and aware poetic voices.\nForch\u00e9\u2019s first book of poetry, Gathering the Tribes (1975), however, is resolutely personal, recounting experiences of the author\u2019s adolescence and young-adult life. Published when she was just twenty four, the book won the 1975 Yale Series of Younger Poets Award. Judge Stanley Kunitz described the work as centering on \u201ckinship\u201d and noted that Forch\u00e9 \u201ctries to understand the bonds of family, race, and sex.\u201d Highly praised as a young poet of \u201cuncommon vigor and assurance,\u201d again according to Oates, Forch\u00e9 received a Guggenheim Fellowship and traveled to El Salvador as part of Amnesty International, in time to witness the unfolding civil war. While there, she viewed inadequate health facilities that had never received the foreign aid designated for them; saw young girls who had been sexually mutilated; and learned of torture victims who had been beaten, starved, and otherwise abused. Her experiences found expression in The Country between Us (1981). As reviewer Katha Pollitt observed in the Nation, Forch\u00e9 \u201cinsists more than once on the transforming power of what she has seen, on the gulf it has created between herself and those who have seen less and dared less.\u201d The poet herself admitted to the compelling nature of her Central American experience. \u201cI tried not to write about El Salvador in poetry, because I thought it might be better to do so in journalistic articles,\u201d she told Jonathan Cott of Rolling Stone. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t\u2014the poems just came.\u201d In these poems Forch\u00e9 \u201caddresses herself unflinchingly to the exterior, historical world,\u201d Oates explained. She did so at a time when most of her contemporaries were writing poetry in which there is no room for politics\u2014poetry, Pollitt stated, \u201cof wistful longings, of failed connections, of inevitable personal loss, expressed in a set of poetic strategies that suit such themes.\u201d\n\nThe Country between Us was named the 1981 Lamont Poetry Selection and became that most-rare publication: a poetry bestseller. In a critique for the Los Angeles Times Book Review, Art Seidenbaum maintained that the poems of the second volume \u201cchronicle the awakening of a political consciousness and are themselves acts of commitment: to concepts and persons, to responsibility, to action.\u201d A Ms reviewer called the book, \u201ca poetry of dissent from a poet outraged.\u201d More than one critic singled out her poem \u201cThe Colonel,\u201d centering on her now-famous encounter with a Salvadoran colonel who, as he made light of human rights, emptied a bag of human ears before Forch\u00e9. Pollitt remarked that \u201cat their best, Forch\u00e9\u2019s poems have the immediacy of war correspondence, postcards from the volcano of twentieth-century barbarism.\u201d Forch\u00e9 herself told Cott: \u201cThe voice in my first book doesn\u2019t know what it thinks, it doesn\u2019t make any judgments. All it can do is perceive and describe and use language to make some sort of re-creation of moments in time. But I noticed that the person in the second book makes an utterance.\u201d\nA dozen years passed between the publication of The Country between Us and Forch\u00e9\u2019s editing of Against Forgetting: Twentieth-Century Poetry of Witness. Matthew Rothschild in the Progressive called the poems in the anthology \u201csome of the most dramatic antiwar and anti-torture poetry written in this benighted century.\u201d They provide, Gail Wronsky pointed out in the Antioch Review, \u201cirrefutable and copious evidence of the human ability to record, to write, to speak in the face of those atrocities.\u201d Building on the tradition of social protest and the antiwar poems of the late 1960s, Forch\u00e9 presents a range of approaches: \u201cMany of the poems here are eyes-open, horrifyingly graphic portrayals of human brutality,\u201d observed Rothschild. \u201cBut others are of defiance, demonstrating resolve and extracting hope even in the most extreme circumstances.\u201d\n\r\nIn an article in the Mason Gazette, Forch\u00e9 commented that \u201cThe poetry of witness reclaims the social from the political and in so doing defends the individual against illegitimate forms of coercion.\u201d The year following the publication of Against Forgetting saw Forch\u00e9 bring out her own book of witness, The Angel of History (1994), which won the 1994 Los Angeles Times Book Award for poetry. The book is divided into five sections dealing with the atrocities of war in France, Japan, and Germany and with references to the poet\u2019s own experiences in Beirut and El Salvador. The title figure, the Angel of History\u2014a figure imagined by Walter Benjamin\u2014can record the miseries of humanity yet is unable either to prevent these miseries from happening or from suffering from the pain associated with them. Kevin Walker, in the Detroit Free Press, called the book \u201ca meditation on destruction, survival and memory.\u201d Don Bogen, in the Nation, saw this as a logical development, since Forch\u00e9\u2019s work with Against Forgetting was \u201cinstrumental in moving her poetry beyond the politics of personal encounter. The Angel of History is rather an extended poetic mediation on the broader contexts\u2014historical, aesthetic, philosophical\u2014which include [the twentieth]\u2026century\u2019s atrocities,\u201d wrote Bogen. And Steven Ratiner, reviewing the work for the Christian Science Monitor, called it one that \u201caddresses the terror and inhumanity that have become standard elements in the twentieth-century political landscape\u2014and yet affirms as well the even greater reservoir of the human spirit.\u201d\n\r\nForch\u00e9\u2019s next collection, Blue Hour (2003) took its title from the translated French phrase for dawn. According to a review in Publisher\u2019s Weekly, the book draws on personal memories, \u201cethereal images of twentieth-century horror\u201d and is \u201cdosed with a mysticism derived from Heidegger and Buber.\u201d Placing Forch\u00e9 squarely in line with the \u201cvisionary abstraction\u201d of fellow poets Michael Palmer and Jorie Graham, the reviewer found sections of the book \u201clovely and mysterious,\u201d and praised the tour-de-force at its center, \u201cOn Earth,\u201d for the adroit foregrounding of its own \u201clyric complications.\u201d Her new books include the collection In the Lateness of the World (2017), which was a finalist for the Nuestadt International Prize for Literature.\nCarolyn Forch\u00e9 is also a noted translator and teacher. Her translations of poets as various as Claribel Alegr\u00eda, Georg Trakl, Robert Desnos and Mahmoud Darwish have won great critical acclaim. She has won numerous grants and awards, including fellowships from the Lannan Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Academy of American Poets. In 1997, she was presented with the Edita and Ira Morris Hiroshima Foundation Award for using her poetry as a \u201cmeans to attain understanding, reconciliation, and peace within communities and between communities.\u201d Hope J. Smith commented in the Madison Gazette that \u201cForch\u00e9\u2019s work is unusual in that it straddles the realms of the political and the poetic, addressing political and social issues in poetry when many poets have abandoned these subjects altogether. In recognizing the link Forch\u00e9 has made between these worlds, the Hiroshima Foundation recognizes her human rights work as much as it does her writing.\u201d Forch\u00e9 is currently University Professor at Georgetown University where she directs the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
