A former Guggenheim fellow, Wiman served as the editor of\u00a0Poetry\u00a0magazine from 2003 to 2013.\u00a0He received an honorary doctorate from North Central College.\r\n\u00a0\r\nMaking use of\u2014and at times gently disassembling\u2014musical and metrical structures, Wiman often explores themes of spiritual faith and doubt in his spare, precise poems. Praising Wiman\u2019s \u201cear for silence\u201d in a review of Every Riven Thing for Smartish Pace, John Poch observed, \u201cRepeatedly in this collection, in his careful way, he\u00a0presses his ear against the hive of belief. It takes a renewed child-like\u00a0faith, and Wiman achieves it through memory and imagination and, one gets the\u00a0feeling, grace.\u201d\u00a0In a 2009 interview with Bookslut editor Jessa Crispin, discussing what he hopes readers might take from his work, Wiman stated, \u201cI have no illusions about adding to sophisticated theological thinking. But I think there are a ton of people out there who are what you might call unbelieving believers, people whose consciousness is completely modern and yet who have this strong spiritual hunger in them. I would like to say something helpful to those people.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nWiman is the author of numerous books of poetry, prose, and poetry in translation.\u00a0Survival Is a Style\u00a0(Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2020) is Wiman's most recent collection; the collection Every Riven Thing (2010) won the Commonwealth Prize from the English Speaking Union, was a finalist for the Kingsley-Tufts Poetry Award, and was named one of the New Yorker\u2019s top 11 poetry books of 2010. His collection, Once in the West (2014)\u00a0was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle award.\u00a0His debut collection, The Long Home (1998), won the Nicholas Roerich Poetry Prize. Stolen Air (2012) contains Wiman\u2019s translations of Osip Mandelstam\u2019s poetry. With Don Share, Wiman coedited The Open Door: One Hundred Poems, One Hundred Years of Poetry Magazine (2012). Wiman\u2019s essay collections include He Held Radical Light: The Art of Faith, the Faith of Art (2018), My Bright Abyss: Meditation of a Modern Believer (2013) and Ambition and Survival: Becoming a Poet (2007).\r\n\u00a0\r\nWiman has taught at Stanford University, Northwestern University, Lynchburg College, and Yale Divinity School. He lives in New Haven, Connecticut.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
