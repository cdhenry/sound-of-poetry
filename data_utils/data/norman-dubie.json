He began writing poetry at age 11 and was influenced by both his father\u2019s Sunday sermons and his mother\u2019s tales of hospital life. Acknowledging his debt as a writer to his parents, Dubie noted in an interview with Poets & Writers magazine, \u201cI got the weirdest introduction to writing from them\u2014my mother, because she would come home from the hospital with the most grisly and grim, detailed stories about people dying, children dying. And she had to unload it, so she\u2019d unload it at the supper table. We all had a love of detail, so we understood \u2026 I really learned not to blink, not to look away, from some of those things in life that are ugly and involve suffering.\u201d After graduating from Goddard College in Vermont, Dubie attended the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, where he wrote his first collection, Alehouse Sonnets (1971), during a blizzard. The book was selected as a runner-up for the International Poetry Forum Prize and later published by the University of Pittsburgh Press. The strength of this first collection, as well as Dubie\u2019s reputation as a teacher at Iowa, where he had remained following his degree, led Richard Howard\u00a0to encourage Dubie to found an MFA program at Arizona State University. Dubie accepted a position there in 1975 and has worked there ever since, currently serving as the Regents Professor of English. His many collections of poetry include Robert Schumann is Mad Again (2019); Quotations of Bone\u00a0(2015), which won the Griffin Poetry Prize; The Volcano\u00a0(2010); The Insomniac Liar of Topo\u00a0(2007); Ordinary Mornings of a Coliseum\u00a0(2004); The Mercy Seat\u00a0(2001); and The Everlastings (1980). His work has been translated into 30 languages. He has received the Bess Hokin Prize from the Poetry Foundation, the PEN Center USA Literary Award for Poetry, and fellowships and grants from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Ingram Merrill Foundation.\nDubie\u2019s work \u201cmanifests a powerful disposition to relocate his imagination out of its own time and place,\u201d wrote Vernon Shetley in the New York Review of Books. This relocation may involve the use of a historically significant locale for the setting of a poem (ancient Egypt), or perhaps the life of an artist from the past (Renoir). In a review of The Everlastings (1980), Shetley draws a close parallel between Dubie\u2019s techniques and those of the creator of the dramatic monologue, Robert Browning: \u201cOne might say that Browning takes a tape recorder to the past, Dubie a camera. [The latter] seeks to evoke emotion through a highly particularized rendering of a world of objects.\u201d\u00a0Though Dubie\u2019s early books sometimes received criticism for their supposed obscurity and extreme facility, the young writer was recognized as \u201ca determined and gifted poet, with energy to burn,\u201d according to Katha Pollitt\u00a0in the Nation. Pollitt also found that Dubie\u2019s \u201clush images \u2026 fold into one another in a way that is often pleasing to the inner eye.\u201d Prolific throughout the 1970s and \u201980s, Dubie became famous for his political, historical imagination and opulently figurative language, as well as his deadpan syntax and style. In books like The City of the Olesha Fruit (1979), Groom Falconer (1989), and Radio Sky (1991), Dubie solidified his reputation as one of America\u2019s premier poets. He is also known as one of the most generous and talented teachers of poetry working today.\nThe final installment of a trilogy that began with The Springhouse (1986), Radio Sky is rife with historical personae and wide-ranging subject manner. A reviewer for Library Journal noted that Dubie\u2019s \u201cspare, conversational style works best when the spiritual, the otherworldly, seeps over into dailiness \u2026 At times the reader has to work to fill in the gaps between title and subject, but the effort is usually rewarding: poetry in many voices, documenting many times.\u201d It was Dubie\u2019s final book for nearly 10 years. During a period in which he increasingly turned to the practice of Tibetan Buddhism, Dubie ceased publishing poems because he felt, as he told Poets & Writers, that he was in danger of falling into \u201ca kind of mannerist writing in which you\u2019re almost caricaturing your own work or satirizing your own work. I felt I was at the point of doing that.\u201d Initially intending to stop for a year or two, Dubie began to seriously practice Buddhism and acknowledges that \u201cit and the teaching completely absorbed me \u2026 I have to say truthfully that nothing ever entered my life with such force as the simple sitting practice and the energy, the states of mind that were involved, the states of mind that were filled with a kind of self-criticism I\u2019d never really enjoyed before. It was all very depressing and scary and lovely. It will touch every cell in your body, this practice. I don\u2019t know, the notion that I\u2019d not only found a religion but one that was animate\u2014if it is indeed a religion\u2014well, it was good news. And it was probably time for me to rest. I had done probably too much work.\u201d\nAfter this period of retreat from poetry, Dubie released The Mercy Seat: Collected and New Poems, 1967-2000 in 2001. The collection contains not only poems from his nearly 20 published books, but also new pieces. Addressing the influence of Buddhism on his writing, Dubie confessed that \u201cthere\u2019s no way you have any success with a sitting, there\u2019s no way that you can actually begin a sitting and somehow tolerate it and not be changed utterly in so many ways. More than anything else, it makes you aware of your own bullshit.\u201d The Mercy Seat was highly praised in all corners. Reviewing the mammoth volume for the Boston Review, Ian Tromp noted Dubie\u2019s trademark talent for \u201cinhabiting a persona and making convincing representations of another person\u2019s life, taking on a different view and experience of the world.\u201d Tromp also recognized the influence of Tibetan Buddhism on Dubie\u2019s work, specifically the idea of \u201cexchange\u201d of oneself for another\u2019s reality, known as Bodhicitta training. This \u201cother-identification,\u201d Tromp argued, is a main tenant of Buddhism and runs throughout Dubie\u2019s oeuvre: \u201cDubie\u2019s texts might be seen as more than dramatic monologues: they would then take on the aspect of spiritual exercises of identification, exchanges of self and other.\u201d The collection, in the words of Ray Gonz\u00e1lez in Bloomsbury Review, \u201creminds of what we missed\u201d in Dubie\u2019s long hiatus.\u00a0\nSince The Mercy Seat, Dubie has published numerous books. His collection Ordinary Mornings of a Coliseum (2004) was hailed as a hugely enjoyable return to form. Concerned with the necessity of suffering to happiness, the book is shot through with anxious speakers and historical anomalies, including references to modern-day catastrophes in Iraq and Afghanistan. In a review for Verse, Brendan O\u2019Conner noted that \u201cthe poems in Ordinary Mornings of a Coliseum compose a fragmentary chronicle, a far-from-complete record of atrocity and heartbreak stitched together with a longing for justice.\u201d The Insomniac Liar of Topo (2007) won both praise and criticism for its frenetic pace and kitchen-sink aesthetic. A reviewer for Publisher\u2019s Weekly granted that \u201cat best, Dubie achieves a desert equivalent of the backwoods dream-vision poetry of Frank Stanford.\u201d Dubie\u2019s collection The Quotations of Bone (2015) won the 2016 Griffin Poetry Prize. The judges\u2019 citation reads, \u201cDubie\u2019s uncontested mastery of the lyric poem has, in this collection, broken into strange and revelatory territory.\u201d\nDubie remains optimistic about the state of American poetry. In an interview with Poets & Writers, he prophesized: \u201cIf we\u2019re remembered as a nation, as a culture of people, an awful lot of poetry and writing in general will survive from this period. It\u2019s a wonderful time to be reading.\u201d\nHe lives and works in Tempe, Arizona.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
