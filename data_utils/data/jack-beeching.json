Born in Hastings, England, he served in the Royal Air Force during World War II. Following the war, injuries he suffered in an automobile accident forced him to leave England and live in a warmer climate to ease his respiratory difficulties.\nBeeching was the author of more than 15 books, including the poetry collections Aspects of Love (1950), Truth Is a Naked Lady (1957), The Polythene Maidenhead (1970), and Poems (1940\u20132000). His poetry garnered praise for his ambition and adherence to formal structures. Writing in the Independent, Mary Corbett states that Beeching\u2019s verse contains \u201cdisciplined metre, subtle half-rhyme and luxuriant syntax which express distinctly \u2018difficult\u2019 metaphysical concerns.\u201d\nAfter a long battle with respiratory complications, Beeching died in 2001.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
