She earned degrees from Smith College and from Cornell University. She is the author of\u00a0The Keepsake Storm\u00a0(2004), which includes poems that explore an uneasy alliance between the vehemence of memory and the surrealism of narrative, especially in light of language, place, faith, and identity.   \u201cFranco's poems,\u201d Alice Fulton says, \u201cenact the thrill of alchemy and metamorphosis, the riveting moment when changelings are betwixt-between, nightingale or monsters\u2014it's hard to tell which, so vast and pliable and layered the scene. The poems bequeath a sense of place so deep it transcends particularity and arrives at the interior terrain of thought, the inscape of what-is.\u201d\u00a0Judith Kitchen, reviewing for the Georgia Review, writes that\u00a0The Keepsake Storm\u2019s \u201cfinal sequence is so finely wrought, so nuanced and complicated, that it alone\u00a0heralds an exciting new presence on the poetic stage.\u201d\nFranco\u2019s work is anthologized in\u00a0A Best of Fence: the First Nine Years,\u00a0The Wind Shifts: New Latino Poetry,\u00a0Camino del Sol: Fifteen Years of Latina and Latino Writing, and\u00a0The Other [email\u00a0protected]: Writing Against a Singular Identity.\u00a0She has served as contributing editor to\u00a0Latino Poetry Review\u00a0and acquiring art editor of\u00a0Pilgrimage Magazine.\u00a0Her honors include\u00a0residencies and fellowships with Casa Libre en la Solana, the Santa Fe Writers\u2019 Conference, and the Bread Loaf Writers\u2019 Conference.\nFranco is an Oblate with the monastic order of the Community of St John. She keeps an online journal of photographs, and she teaches at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
