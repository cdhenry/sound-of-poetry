She received a BA and an MA from the University of Toronto and worked as a librarian, social worker, and teacher, writing her poetry in the evenings. Avison\u2019s collections of poetry include Winter Sun (1960), Dumbfounding (1966), Sunblue (1978), No Time (1990), Concrete and Wild Carrot (2002), and Momentary Dark (2006).\nAvison became a devout Christian in 1963, and her work is often described by reviewers as introspective, observant, and deeply spiritual. Judith Fitzgerald, writing of Avison\u2019s posthumous collection Listening (2009) in the Globe and Mail, commented: \u201cAn original, an authentic visionary without the flashily splashy trappings so often accorded those whose egos impose themselves upon others in their dubiously designated \u2018poetry,\u2019 Avison praises Creation in all its transplendent awesome/awful mutations.\u201d\nAvison was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1984. She received the Governor General\u2019s Award twice, the Griffin Poetry Prize in 2003 for Concrete and Wild Carrot, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Leslie K. Tarr Award for outstanding contribution to Christian writing in Canada. She died in 2007 in Toronto.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Canada"]}}
