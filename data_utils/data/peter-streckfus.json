Streckfus\u2019s allusive poems frequently mix historical and imagined references in pursuit of lyric truth. In the Boston Review, Garth Greenwell wrote, \u201cStreckfus abdicates common, worldly logic \u2026 his weird metamorphoses, his narrative leaps and gaps seem compelled, like Dickinson\u2019s, by an urge to disclosure matched perfectly with reticence.\u201d \u00a0 Louise Gl\u00fcck selected Streckfus\u2019s debut collection, The Cuckoo (2004), for the Yale Series of Younger Poets. His additional honors include fellowships from the Breadloaf Writer\u2019s Conference and the Peter S. Reed Foundation, as well as two Pushcart Prize nominations. In 2013 he was a Rome Prize Fellow in Literature. His work has been anthologized in Under the Rock Umbrella: Contemporary American Poets from 1951 to 1977 (2006), Art at Our Doorstep: San Antonio Writers +Artists (2008), and Poets on Teaching (2010). \u00a0 Streckfus has taught at Western Connecticut State University and the University of Alabama. He is on faculty in the Creative Writing Program at George Mason University and lives in the Washington D.C. area with his wife, the poet and translator Heather Green.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"]}}
