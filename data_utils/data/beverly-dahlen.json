She was educated at Humboldt State University, where she earned a BA, and at San Francisco State University.\nDahlen\u2019s poems and sequences are open-ended and language driven, informed by Freudian free association and often engaged with themes of beauty and death. In 1978, Dahlen began her ongoing work A Reading, which has been published in several volumes so far: A Reading 1\u20137 (1985), A Reading 8\u201310 (1992), A Reading 11\u201317 (1989), and A Reading 18\u201320 (2006). She is also the author of Out of the Third (1974) and several chapbooks, including A Letter at Easter: To George Stanley (1976), The Egyptian Poems (1983), and A-reading Spicer & eighteen sonnets (2004).\nIn an artist statement for her Foundation for Contemporary Arts grant, Dahlen remarked on the origins of A Reading: \u201cIn June 1978, I embarked on a project I called A Reading, it was intended to be an open-ended work and was based to some extent on the Freudian principle of free association. I thought of it as an \u2018interminable analysis,\u2019 perhaps it is less analytic and more free with all the difficulties that freedom implies. I was curious about evading the \u2018editor\u2019 as I worked and was interested in revealing facets of the ego of the \u2018writer.\u2019 As a reading it was meant to address language, the language of the works one read as well as one's own language.\u201d\nDahlen is the recipient of a grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts and a Lifetime Achievement Award from Small Press Traffic. She was a founding editor of the feminist journal HOW(ever), which is now the online journal HOW2. She lives in San Francisco.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern", "U.S., Western"]}}
