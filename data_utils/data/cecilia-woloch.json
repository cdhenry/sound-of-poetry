She is the author of several poetry collections, including Tsigan: The Gypsy Poem\u00a0(2018, 2002),\u00a0Carpathia (2009), Late (2003), and Sacrifice (1997). Her poetry has been translated into several languages and included in numerous anthologies, such as An Introduction to the Prose Poem (2009), Best American Erotic Poems: From 1800 to the Present (2008), and 180 More: Extraordinary Poems for Every Day (2005). Former US\u00a0poet laureate Ted Kooser has included her work in his syndicated newspaper column, American Life in Poetry.\nInfluenced by Anna Akhmatova, W.S. Merwin, and Walt Whitman, Woloch writes lyrical poems of witness and exploration. Many of Woloch\u2019s poems arise from her extensive travels, and in an interview with Web Del Sol, she stated, \u201c[W]hen I\u2019m in a place that\u2019s really strange to me\u2014when I don\u2019t know the language or the customs or the geography that surrounds me\u2014I feel more self-contained, more a sense that my home is within myself. At the same time, there\u2019s more of a sense of just being part of the sea of humanity, a way that those barriers\u2014language, culture, borders\u2014seem to dissolve.\u201d\nWoloch\u2019s honors include fellowships from the Fulbright Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the California Arts Council, Chateau de La Napoule Retreat for Artists, and the Isaac W. Bernheim Foundation. She has collaborated with painter John Weber and choreographer Anna Leo.\nThe founding director of the Paris Poetry Workshop and Summer Poetry in Idyllwild, Woloch has also taught at the University of Southern California, Western Connecticut State University,\u00a0Georgia College & State University, the Western Connecticut State University MFA program in writing, the New England College MFA program in poetry, and the summer program at Sichuan University in China. She is based in Los Angeles.\ufeff\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
