Her first book,\u00a0Star Quilt,\u00a0juxtaposes her ancestral culture with formal approaches to verse.\u00a0The poems\u00a0revolve around six basic directions: north, south, east, west, skyward, and earthward. A sense of dispossession engendered by forced migration has long been a part of Oneida culture and is evident in Hill\u2019s poetry. She employs the dominant iambic rhythms of Western culture while capturing the personal and cultural loss of the Oneida.\nHill credits the influence of other contemporary Native American writers as well as her musician father and well-read grandmother for instilling confidence in her own work. Commenting on historical displacement as well as her family\u2019s own transient nature in Survival This Way: Interviews with American Indian Poets, Hill states,\u00a0\u201cFor most of my life I felt this sense of exile and alienation and a fear. ... But there is this sense of home and of completeness that I also feel. Somehow I think that part of the writing is to set the record straight\u2014for myself, to explain things for myself as if I were still a child inside.\u201d For Hill, language embodies not just loss but also hope and possibility: \u201cI think language truly is how we become who we are.\u201d\nHill\u2019s work has been anthologized in Harper\u2019s Anthology of Twentieth Century Native American Poetry (1988),\u00a0The Third Woman: Minority Women Writers of the United States (1980), and Carriers of the Dream Wheel: Contemporary Native American Poetry (1975). She is the recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts grant.\nHill has taught English and American Indian studies at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison and in Poets-in-the-Schools programs in various states, including Minnesota, Arizona, and Oklahoma.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
