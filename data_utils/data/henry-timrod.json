Henry was educated at the Classical School of Christopher Cotes, generally considered to be the best available, where Paul Hamilton Hayne, the poet, and Basil L. Gildersleeve, the classical scholar, were his classmates, and where he was offered a sound grounding in such traditional subjects as Greek, Latin, French, history, and mathematics. Later, with help from a Charleston merchant, he attended the University of Georgia for three terms from 1845 to 1846, continuing his classical studies but dropping out when financial difficulties occurred. Returning home, he read law with James Louis Petigru, a distinguished lawyer and former attorney general of the state, and in the 1850s he devoted himself to teaching school and tutoring on Carolina plantations. Meanwhile he had begun contributing poems in 1846 to the Charleston Evening News and in 1849 to periodicals such as the Southern Literary Messenger.\nSince Timrod\u2019s output before the Civil War was limited to verse sufficient only for a single volume\u2014published in December 1859\u2014his literary reputation at the time was modest. The political activities surrounding the formation of a new nation and the impact of the war itself aroused Timrod\u2019s poetic imagination, however, and he quickly became widely known as the literary spokesman and eventually as the so-called poet laureate of the Confederacy, an unofficial title he has retained ever since. After the war, poor health associated with the complications of tuberculosis and abject poverty related to political and social conditions in South Carolina during Reconstruction made it impossible for Timrod to fulfill the promise or equal the achievement of his wartime performance, and he died in 1867, two months before his 39th birthday.\nWhen Russell\u2019s Magazine, under the editorship of his old friend Hayne, began appearing in Charleston in April 1857, Timrod found a substantial outlet for his poetry and criticism. During the three-year life of Russell\u2019s, Timrod contributed 37 poems, including several of his best of the period\u2014\u201cThe Arctic Voyager\u201d (April 1857), \u201cDreams\u201d (May 1857), \u201cPraeceptor Amat\u201d (February 1858), and \u201cSonnet: At Last, Beloved Nature\u201d (February 1859). These pieces suggest Timrod\u2019s versatility with subject, line, and form. \u201cThe Arctic Voyager,\u201d in blank verse, follows the experience of Captain Elisha Kent Kane, an Arctic explorer, who tells about his third attempt to reach the North Pole in a Tennysonian dramatic monologue fashioned after \u201cUlysses\u201d (1842). In the last 12 lines he addresses his \u201chardy shipmates\u201d directly, urging them not \u201cto count the chances\u201d but to do all that \u201cbold and patient hearts can do.\u201d \u201cDreams,\u201d on the other hand, deals with the power of intuitive reverie in seven quatrains with an abab rhyme scheme and concludes that \u201cour dreams\u201d are \u201callegories with deep hearts of truth / That tell us solemn secrets of ourselves.\u201d Yet another approach is taken in \u201cPraeceptor Amat,\u201d in which a tutor is halfway in love with one of the pupils who is studying Greek and reading Homer with him. The lines are long to suggest the Greek, and the heroic couplet provides dignity for a topic that is not to be taken too seriously, a fairly rare situation in Timrod\u2019s canon. This poem is based upon his own experience in 1856 with one of his favorite students, Felicia Robinson, as Edd Winfield Parks and others have pointed out. Finally, the sonnet \u201cAt Last, Beloved Nature!\u201d finds him working in a favorite genre\u2014one of his most impressive essays is \u201cThe Character and Scope of the Sonnet,\u201d which also appeared in Russell\u2019s (May 1857). Though the lyric is basically Italian in pattern, the rhyme scheme of the second quatrain is different from the norm and the sestet is turned upside down, with the couplet appearing in the first two lines instead of the last two; consequently, the resolution of the poem is in the sestet and not in the couplet. Altogether, there is an interesting variety in subject and technique in some of his best verse for Russell\u2019s.\nTimrod also contributed some of his best prose to the monthly, a total of four essays, including \u201cThe Character and Scope of the Sonnet\u201d and two others deserving of mention: \u201cWhat Is Poetry?\u201d (October 1857) and \u201cLiterature in the South\u201d (August 1859). The piece on the sonnet defends the form\u2014and William Wordsworth\u2014from the attacks of a \u201clarge body of depreciators\u201d and shows that poetry is far more than the \u201cresult of a sort of mystical inspiration,\u201d for it also requires the artistry of \u201cpatient and elaborate execution.\u201d \u201cWhat Is Poetry?\u201d is a response to an essay of the same title by William J. Grayson, a well-known lawyer and former member of Congress, who had presented a neoclassical view of the topic. Timrod, on the contrary, offers a romantic interpretation that concentrates on unusual sensibility, powerful emotion, and beautiful language. The last article in Russell\u2019s, \u201cLiterature in the South,\u201d is, as Jay B. Hubbell has pointed out in The South in American Literature, 1607-1900 (1954), \u201cthe most penetrating analysis of the difficulties of the Southern author.\u201d Timrod sees the writer in the South as \u201cthe Pariah of modern literature,\u201d an artist without honor in his own country and ridiculed in the North as a representative (and often defender) of an outmoded and immoral way of life. The Southern author, then, has a limited audience and serious difficulties that may seldom be resolved.\nTimrod\u2019s contributions to Russell\u2019s, especially those in verse, led to the publication of the only collection that appeared during his lifetime, Poems, in December 1859, an event that seemed to presage a certain kind of literary career; but the coming of the war changed his poetic focus and charged his imagination in a different way. The establishment of the new government in Montgomery provided him with his first topic, and he responded with \u201cOde on Occasion of the Meeting of the Southern Congress\u201d (Charleston Daily Courier, February 23, 1861; later retitled \u201cEthnogenesis\u201d), an announcement by a narrator of the arrival of a new \u201cnation among nations,\u201d warning \u201cour foes\u201d of the North that the Confederates shall \u201cGo forth / To meet them, marshaled by the Lord of Hosts,\u201d and prophesying that in the future the young country would share the blessings of \u201cwealth, and power, and peace\u201d with the \u201cwhole sad planet o\u2019er.\u201d\nLater in the year and in spite of the abortive nature of his first military experience (he enlisted, but poor health quickly led to his discharge), Timrod, still imbued with patriotism and sanguine about the future of the country, sought again to celebrate the virtues of the Confederate state and to examine its future in a second laureate poem, \u201cThe Cotton Boll\u201d (Charleston Mercury, September 3, 1861). Once more a speaker looks out over the natural world of the South, notes that it is blessed with \u201call the common gifts of God,\u201d and concludes that \u201cno fairer land hath fired a poet\u2019s lay, / Or given a home to man.\u201d The Confederacy will not only share its wealth with the rest of the world, but it will also \u201cRevive the half-dead dream of universal peace.\u201d In the meantime, however, the foe must be overcome and forced to return to \u201chis own blasted altar-stones, and crave / Mercy,\u201d which, in due course, will be granted. These odes and ten other lyrics of this period\u2014 \u201cI Know Not Why,\u201d \u201cA Cry to Arms,\u201d \u201cCarolina,\u201d \u201cCharleston,\u201d \u201cChristmas,\u201d \u201cSpring,\u201d \u201cThe Two Armies,\u201d \u201cCarmen Triumphale,\u201d \u201cThe Unknown Dead,\u201d and \u201cOde Sung on the Occasion of Decorating the Graves of the Confederate Dead\u201d\u2014constitute the core of Timrod\u2019s poetic tribute and contribution to the Confederacy and commentary on the war in all its manifestations of glory and horror.\nThe poems Timrod wrote during the war years reflect and express his moods and his views on the new nation and its progress and on the war and its results. In \u201cEthnogenesis\u201d and \u201cThe Cotton Boll\u201d the mood is hopeful, but, concurrently, there is a feeling of melancholy and foreboding in \u201cI Know Not Why,\u201d a sonnet written in August 1861 and published in the Charleston Mercury (October 7, 1861), the period during which \u201cThe Cotton Boll\u201d was composed. The speaker\u2019s allusions to \u201cthis weary day,\u201d to \u201csad fancies\u201d and a \u201cvessel losing way,\u201d to \u201ca banner drooping in the rain, / And meadows beaten into bloody clay\u201d suggest something more than a personal response to surroundings, for the \u201cbloody clay\u201d may refer not only to the battles already fought, chiefly the first battle of Bull Run, but to future conflicts as well, such as those that led in 1862 to the loss of Forts Henry and Donelson in Tennessee and of Roanoke Island and a sizable portion of eastern North Carolina, leaving Charleston with dim prospects for the days to come.\nTimrod responded to these developments with \u201cA Cry to Arms\u201d (Charleston Mercury and Daily Courier, March 4, 1862), \u201cCarolina\u201d (Charleston Daily Courier, March 8, 1862), and \u201cCharleston\u201d (Charleston Mercury, December 3, 1862). The first two lyrics exhort Southerners and Carolinians to meet and defeat the foe, described in \u201cA Cry to Arms\u201d as \u201cthe despot\u201d who \u201croves your fairest lands\u201d and in \u201cCarolina\u201d as the \u201cHuns\u201d who \u201ctread thy sacred sands.\u201d \u201cWe Battle for our Country\u2019s sake,\u201d the speaker maintains in the first poem, and in the second he calls upon Carolinians to \u201cRouse all thy strength and all thy skill\u201d and \u201cAll shall be safe beneath thy sod.\u201d In \u201cCharleston\u201d the city \u201cbides the foe\u201d and \u201ca thousand guns\u201d \u201cwait and watch for blood,\u201d but the issue is in doubt and the city \u201cwaits the triumph or the tomb.\u201d Only a few weeks later, in \u201cChristmas\u201d (Charleston Mercury, December 25, 1862), the narrator, with the experience of the aftermath of Shiloh in April behind him (Timrod had been there as a correspondent) and despite the Confederate victory at Fredericksburg on December 13, questions the propriety of battle in the midst of \u201cthis hallowed day\u201d and wonders how \u201cwe bear the mirth\u201d while remembering the death \u201ca year ago\u201d of someone who now \u201ckeeps his mute Christmas\u201d in \u201ccold Virginian earth.\u201d He cries therefore for \u201cpeace, peace in all our homes / And peace in all our hearts!\u201d\nIn 1863 Timrod expresses and anticipates a modern view of war and its consequences in four poems published in the Southern Illustrated News: \u201cSpring\u201d (April 4), \u201cThe Two Armies\u201d (May 30), \u201cCarmen Triumphale\u201d (June 7), and \u201cThe Unknown Dead\u201c (July 4). These pieces were prepared in the early part of the year when the Confederacy was holding its own in the East; they celebrate the important Southern victory of Chancellorsville and mourn the unexpected death of General Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson. In \u201cSpring\u201d the eternal return of life represented by the blooming jasmine and crocus brings with it \u201cthoughts of war and crime,\u201d \u201cthe call of Death,\u201d and the rousing of a \u201cmillion men to arms.\u201d In such circumstances spring can only encourage nature \u201cTo fall and crush the tyrants and the slaves / Who turn her meads to graves.\u201d In \u201cCarmen Triumphale\u201d the charge is even more emphatic. \u201cOur foes\u201d have \u201cfought as tyrants fight,\u201d the speaker asserts, and they have rightly \u201cfallen,\u201d their bones \u201cbleaching on the sands, / Or mouldering slow in shallow graves.\u201d Nevertheless, he concludes, \u201cLord! Bid the frenzied tempest cease.\u201d \u201cThe Two Armies\u201d celebrates, as Walt Whitman did concurrently in his poem of the same name, those on the front line and those on the home front, concluding that when \u201ctriumph\u201d has been achieved and \u201cfreedom\u201d won, \u201ceach shall see its dearest prize / gleam softly from the other\u2019s eyes.\u201d Spring appears again in \u201cThe Unknown Dead\u201c as the narrator, speaking in the first person, counts the cost of victory and of battles \u201cnobly lost\u201d; he imagines \u201cmyriad unknown heroes\u201d in \u201cnameless graves\u201d who fought \u201cfor freedom and for right\u201d but whose graves arouse an ironic response from \u201cNature\u2019s self\u201d: \u201cOblivious of the crimson debt / To which she owes her April grace,\u201d she only \u201claughs gaily o\u2019er their burial place.\u201d Such poems, though they may lack the bite and disillusionment of World War I poetry as explored in the works of Alan Seeger, Siegfried Sassoon, or Wilfred Owen, nevertheless look forward to it in use of irony, tone, and in a searing sense of loss.\nTimrod\u2019s ultimate poetic contribution on the war and its result is his \u201cOde Sung on the Occasion of Decorating the Graves of the Confederate Dead, at Magnolia Cemetery, Charleston, S.C., 1866\u201d (Charleston Daily Courier, June 18, 1866; revised, July 23, 1866). The poem is a tribute to those who have given their lives for a \u201cfallen cause,\u201d those in \u201chumble graves\u201d who wait for stone monuments and are honored with \u201cmemorial blooms\u201d by their \u201csisters for the years,\u201d who, by remembering these \u201cmartyrs\u201d with their tears and flowers, share in this public recognition. The ode is Timrod\u2019s most perfect poem, worthy of those whom it celebrates, a testimonial to the poet\u2019s own work, and deserving of high rank among all Horatian odes in English.\nAlthough Timrod\u2019s most important poetry is related to the war, he also composed other notable verse during the period, including \u201cOur Willie,\u201d \u201cA Mother\u2019s Wail,\u201d \u201cKatie,\u201d and \u201cLa Belle Juive.\u201d \u201cKatie\u201d (printed concurrently in the Charleston Mercury and the Charleston Daily Courier, December 28, 1861) is a tribute to Katie S. Goodwin, later his wife but at the time of composition only one of several women Timrod found particularly interesting. He was \u201canxious\u201d about the piece because, as he expressed it in a letter of December 25, 1861 to Rachel Lyons, another of his close female friends, it \u201cwas so purely an inspiration\u201d with only \u201csmall recourse to art in the execution\u201d; enough readers liked it for it to appear in a separate publication in 1884, however. Initially titled \u201cRachel,\u201d \u201cLa Belle Juive\u201d (Charleston Daily Courier, January 23, 1862) honors Lyons only a month after the tribute to Goodwin. More concentrated and less flowery in diction than \u201cKatie,\u201d \u201cLa Belle Juive\u201d offers a brief narrative in triplets that describes the poet\u2019s response to the beauty of one of \u201cthe noblest women of your race\u201d and characterizes their relationship in the scriptural context of that of Boaz and Ruth, although at the end the image of Ruth lying at the feet of Boaz is reversed to that of the poet lying at the feet of Rachel. These love poems and the pair of lyrics about the death of his son, William Henry Timrod, demonstrate that Timrod could readily manage nonmartial themes and topics, but the war and the Confederacy stirred his imagination in special ways and furnished him with material for his most memorable poetry.\nThe war also provided Timrod with an occasion to write another important essay. In 1863 he was asked to deliver a lecture before the Methodist Female College in Columbia in aid of Confederate soldiers, and he took as his topic \u201cA Theory of Poetry\u201d (eventually published in the Independent, March 28, April 4, and April 11, 1901). In arriving at his own view of poetry, he disagrees with Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s ideas that a long poem (the epic in particular) is a contradiction in terms and that poetry is limited in subject to \u201cthe sense of the beautiful.\u201d Timrod maintains, on the contrary, that John Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost (1667), for example, has a cumulative effect and a general harmony and unity and that poetry, while including beauty as a source, must also have power and truth and embody great moral and philosophical lessons.\nAfter the cessation of hostilities in 1865, Timrod had little time to write poems. He tried to support his family\u2014he had married Goodwin, his sister Emily\u2019s sister-in-law, on February 16, 1864, and their only child, William Henry or \u201cWillie\u201d, was born the following Christmas Eve\u2014but his work as an editor and journalist paid little, frequently not at all, and they lived from hand to mouth, selling family furniture and silver and reluctantly accepting money from friends, including William Gilmore Simms and Hayne. During this period Timrod had recurrent hemorrhages, but he managed to write a few poems and work on a manuscript of a new edition of his verse. In two of these pieces, \u201cOur Willie\u201d (September 1866) and \u201cA Mother\u2019s Wail\u201d (October 1866), both published in Scott\u2019s Monthly and both about the death of Willie on October 23, 1865, the agony of loss is imparted with little aesthetic distance. Less than two years later, Timrod died of tuberculosis on October 7, 1867, 18 years to the day after the death of Poe.\nTimrod is, after Poe, the most important Southern poet of the 19th century. The quality of his best work, though small in bulk, exceeds that of Sidney Lanier and Hayne, and his contributions to war and nature poetry also exceed theirs.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"]}}
