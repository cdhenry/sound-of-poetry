The son of Jewish immigrants from Poland, Keats was a precocious artist, though the family couldn\u2019t afford to send him to art school. Instead, after graduating from high school, Keats painted murals for the WPA and found work illustrating comics. During World War II, he designed camouflage patterns; by the 1950s, his illustrations had started appearing in magazines.  \u00a0 His first children\u2019s book, My Dog Is Lost! (1960), depicted a young Puerto Rican child searching for his dog. Two years later came The Snowy Day (1962), one of the most famous children\u2019s books ever published in the US. Taking inspiration from a group of photos in Life magazine that showed a young African American child about to receive an injection, Keats developed the character of Peter, also a young African American child who, over a number of books, sets out to explore his world. About his decision to portray children of color, Keats once wrote, \u201cNone of the manuscripts I\u2019d been illustrating featured any black kids\u2014except for token blacks in the background. My book would have him there simply because he should have been there all along.\u201d The Snowy Day was widely acclaimed and won a Caldecott Medal. Keats\u2019s books for children include Whistle for Willie (1964), Peter\u2019s Chair (1967), A Letter to Amy (1968), Goggles (1969), and Pet Show! (1972).  \u00a0 Keats wrote and illustrated more than 85 books for children. His illustrations are unique in their simplicity and lushness; he used a collage technique along with gouache to create rich scenes of urban life that included echoes of \u201cfine art\u201d styles such as cubism and abstraction. Keats was the first artist to design a set of greeting cards for UNICEF, and he was the first children\u2019s book author-illustrator asked to donate his papers to Harvard. \u00a0 In 2012, the Jewish Museum mounted an exhibition of Keats\u2019s work.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {}}
