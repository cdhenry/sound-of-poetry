In his 2010 introduction to her work in the Academy of American Poets journal American Poet, Eady states, \u201cAlmost all the poems in Slow Dance [w]ith Trip Wire seem to occur in an ever-present, ever-widening past tense. The private and public, the light and dark, and the spirit and \u201cnormal\u201d worlds co-mingle freely, sometimes stanza by stanza, at times almost line by line.\u201d In an interview with Marietta Papic for 12 Questions, Rankine states, \u201cI tell the truth, but I try to be kind about it.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nRankine\u2019s honors include a \u201cDiscovery\u201d/Boston Review Poetry Prize, a MacDowell Colony Fellowship, and an honorary Cave Canem Fellowship.
