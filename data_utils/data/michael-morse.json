His first collection of poems,\u00a0Void and Compensation\u00a0(2015), was a finalist for the 2016 Kate Tufts Discovery Prize.\nOf\u00a0Void and Compensation, Catherine Barnett writes, \u201cThe tenderness of a man\u2019s trials\u2014trial as in inquiry, experiment, ordeal, worry\u2014rigmaroles with sheer musical bravura in these poems ... I love the indecision that allows the deepest human truths (doubt, desire, hope, regret) to draw a \u2018promiscuity of maps.\u00a0The speaker in these poems is equal parts lost and found, beautifully so.\u201d\u00a0Poet Maureen N. McLane adds, \u201cMorse\u2019s astonishing centerpiece poem\u2014(Poem as Aporia Between Lighthouses)\u2014establishes him as a worthy successor to, among others, Wallace Stevens. Open to history, geography, to the birds in the air and the names of teams on jerseys, these poems are discursive yet leashed, wide-ranging yet poised. Morse gives us a mind at work, and a heart plugged in.\u201d\nA recipient of fellowships from The Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown and numerous residencies, he lives in Brooklyn\u00a0and teaches at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School and The Iowa Summer Writing Festival. He is a poetry editor at\u00a0The Literary Review.\n", "attrs": {}}
