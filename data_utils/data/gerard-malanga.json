Malanga began writing poetry as a teenager, and has published numerous books of poetry, including chic death (1971), Mythologies of the Heart (1996),\u00a0No Respect: New And Selected Poems 1964-2000 (2001), and Cool & Other Poems\u00a0(2019). Influenced by poets Paul Blackburn, Charles Olson and Charles Simic, Malanga\u2019s expansive, free-verse poetry often engages themes of perception and intimacy. As he notes in a 2002 interview with Richard Marshall for 3am Magazine, \u201cI've always thought of poetry as an introverted process whereas photography has always been an extroverted process. But they both involve the eye to a certain extent \u2014 both the inner eye and the outer eye.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nMalanga was the chief assistant for artist Andy Warhol in the mid-1960s, with whom he founded the magazine Interview in 1969. Malanga was also featured in several of Warhol\u2019s films, collaborated with Warhol on his \u201cScreen Tests\u201d project, and was a member of Warhol\u2019s cross-genre undertaking, \u201cThe Exploding Plastic Inevitable.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nMalanga has also published the photography books Good Girls (1994) and Resistance to Memory (1998). He served as the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation\u2019s first photo archivist, and edited a study on the link between photography and voyeurism, Scopophilia: The Love of Looking (1985). With Victor Bockris, Malanga co-authored Up-Tight: The Velvet Underground Story (2003).\r\n\u00a0\r\nHe lives in New York City.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
