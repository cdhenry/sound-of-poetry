According to fellow poet Simon Armitage in the New Statesman, Harrison sees himself as a poet, regardless of the format of his writing. \u201c[H]e sees it all as part of the same task, the task of being a poet,\u201d stated Armitage. Harrison himself has said that \u201cpoetry is all I write, whether for books, or readings, or for the National Theatre, or for the opera house and concert hall, or even for TV.\u201d His enormously wide-ranging oeuvre includes film, theater and \u201cjournalistic\u201d poems written for the Guardian newspaper during conflicts in the Persian Gulf and Bosnia. Harrison is also a well-regarded translator, and his translations and adaptations of English medieval mystery plays, Moliere, Racine and countless Greek dramas have been hugely successful. Noted especially for his out-spoken politics, Harrison\u2019s poetry treats issues of class, race and power with extraordinary formal brilliance and technique.\nThe son of a baker, Harrison grew up in working-class Leeds in post-war \u201causterity Britain.\u201d While he won a scholarship to attend Leeds Grammar School, and later read Classics at Leeds University, Harrison has remained keenly aware of the discrepancy between his early life and his later professional success. One of many who have noted the influence of that background, Armitage was \u201cimpressed with the way [Harrison] deals with his upbringing and background in his poems, and more specifically, his accent.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019d have thought,\u201d remarked Armitage, \u201cthat some of t\u2019most moving poems in t\u2019language would have been composed in a form of English normally reserved for sheep-shaggers and colliers?\u201d Calling Harrison \u201ca distinctly British poet,\u201d Mary Kaiser in World Literature Today also noted that Harrison\u2019s \u201ccentral poetic concern is with a distinctly British problem.\u201d Harrison has a \u201cpredominant fascination with social and class conflict,\u201d stated Kaiser, who noted that \u201cthroughout his work the dynamic of an overlooked minority resisting an elite and powerful majority plays itself out, whether the context is ancient Greece or Rome, the postwar Leeds of his childhood, or contemporary London.\u201d\nIn Harrison\u2019s first full-length book of poetry, The Loiners (1970), the author explored his relationship with the eponymous citizens of the working-class community of Leeds. Yet, reflecting Harrison\u2019s own experiences of teaching in Nigeria and working in Prague, the book ranges widely in location and topic, from childhood encounters with sex in Leeds to tales of love in Eastern Europe. In a review of The Loiners, the Listener\u2019s John Fuller concluded, \u201cThe sheer vigour and intelligence of Harrison\u2019s poetry is as heady as young wine, and should produce great things when it matures.\u201d However, Harrison\u2019s forays into drama would provide the pivotal point in his career. In 1973, he translated Moliere\u2019s Le Misanthrope at the invitation of London National Theatre director John Dexter. Harrison\u2019s previous dramatic work\u2014Aikin Mata (1966), a version of Lysistrata set in Nigeria\u2014had focused on showing a classic play as a living work. His later dramatic writing continued this pattern: he set The Misanthrope in 1966, earning the praise of the London Observer\u2019s Robert Brustein, who called it \u201cdazzling, a work of art in its own right, brilliantly witty, clever and conversational.\u201d Harrison went on to create a version of Phaedre (1975) set in the British Raj, and to create a modern version of the 15th-century York mystery plays. In 1977, he became the resident dramatist at the National Theatre for two years, during which time he also completed Bow Down (1977), an original exploration of traditional and ancient ballads.\nHarrison\u2019s next full-length book of poetry appeared in 1978. From \u201cThe School of Eloquence\u201d and Other Poems was a more explicit exploration of class issues than The Loiners had been, provoking critical controversy. Writing in Encounter, Alan Brownjohn found Harrison\u2019s insights \u201chammered into crude containers for heavy irony and his very own brand of chip-on-the-shoulder coarseness,\u201d while in the Spectator, Emma Fisher found the poems \u201cclever, chewy, good but indigestible like rock buns.\u201d In a Times Literary Supplement review of Continuous, Christopher Reid found Harrison \u201cfrequently both touching and funny when he writes about his own role as a poet\u201d and described the book as \u201csplendidly rich\u2026full of wit, tenderness, honesty, intelligence and anger.\u201d While critics have generally acknowledged Harrison\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d in conveying a message through his work, his early poems generally escaped charges that his craft suffered for his subject matter. Harrison\u2019s most famous poem, and his first foray into television, is undoubtedly V (1985). Set at his parents\u2019 grave in Leeds cemetery, V is a perfect example of Harrison\u2019s politically involved yet carefully crafted aesthetic. The film, when broadcast by the BBC, caused a media firestorm. Attacked by political pundits for its unabashed use of certain four-letter words, the piece was widely hailed by the literary world as a masterpiece. It inaugurated a run of successful poems written specifically for television.\nThe title poem of Harrison\u2019s 1992 collection, The Gaze of the Gorgon, was written for television and broadcast again on the BBC. \u201cIn it,\u201d explained Michael Lockwood in School Library Journal, \u201cTony Harrison uses Greek myth and an elaborate narrative concerned with the statutes of German poets to trace the dehumanizing force of war as it has re-emerged in recent conflicts.\u201d Concerned primarily with war, the book also includes \u201cThe Cold Coming,\u201d a poem spoken in the voice of an Iraqi soldier killed at the end of the Gulf War. More of Harrison\u2019s works written for the theater and television were published in The Shadow of Hiroshima and Other Film/Poems (1995). Armitage claimed that \u201cHarrison\u2019s achievements in [the] poetic fields [within film and television] have helped to create the opportunity for others, such as me, to have a go.\u201d Harrison\u2019s Collected Film Poetry was published in 2007.\nCritics have generally praised Harrison over the years, finding his work to have grown in depth, maturity, and mastery of the language. In a review in The Times of Selected Poems (1995), Robert Nye noted that Harrison \u201chas been hailed as the first genuine working-class poet England has produced this century.\u201d In a Times Literary Supplement article, Tim Kendall recognized that \u201cHarrison\u2019s poetry in recent years has become increasingly public and politically engaged.\u201d Reviewing Laureate\u2019s Block (2000), Kendall, who noted the collection revealed a \u201cpoet as controversialist,\u201d judged its poetry as \u201cmaddeningly uneven.\u201d However he noted the work \u201cbecomes more successful when Harrison retreats into the private realm.\u201d Harrison\u2019s Collected Poems, when it arrived in 2007 along with his Collected Film Poems, was cause for critical re-evaluation. In the Independent, Bill Greenwell judged Harrison\u2019s poetry \u201cstudious drollery,\u201d adding \u201cHarrison wants to be understood, read, watched; to be profoundly accessible, as well as accessibly profound.\u201d In the London Review of Books, Michael Wood noted the \u201ceclecticism of [Harrison\u2019s] style, an idiosyncratic mix of idiomatic Northern cadences and the classical tradition.\u201d\nIn 2009, Harrison won the inaugural PEN/Pinter Prize. Given in honor and memory of the playwright Harold Pinter, the award celebrates writers who have displayed a commitment to Pinter\u2019s own belief in the power of literature to \u201cdefine the real truth of our lives and our societies.\u201d Citing Harrison\u2019s \u201cunmistakable and passionate voice,\u201d the judges acknowledged that no writer better exemplified Pinter\u2019s unwavering commitment to capturing the world through art than Tony Harrison.\nHarrison\u2019s many other honors include the Faber Memorial Award, the European Poetry Translation Prize, and a UNESCO fellowship. A fellow of the Royal Society of Literature since 1984, Harrison lives in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
