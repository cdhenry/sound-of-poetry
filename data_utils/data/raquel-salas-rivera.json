Rivera is the author of six chapbooks and four collections of poetry: Caneca de anhelo turbios (Editora Educaci\u00f3n Emergente, 2011), tierra intermitente (Ediciones Alayubia, 2017), both published in Puerto Rico; lo terciario/the tertiary (Timeless, Infinite Light, 2018), which was nominated for the National Book Award; and x/ex/exis (poemas para la naci\u00f3n) (Bilingual Press/ Editorial Biling\u00fce, forthcoming 2019), winner of the first Ambroggio Prize from the Academy of American Poets. Of their work, informed by Leftist politics as well as Spanish language literary traditions, Rivera has said, \u201cThere are poems like solidarities. This is the most ideal case. It makes people reach out to me, like after a reading, when I write something and other Boricuas are like, \u2018This poem about the debt made me cry.\u2019 When I see them cry, and they're thanking me for writing it, that's not just a poem. It becomes larger than itself. It becomes an interaction in the world, which is doing a kind of political work.\u201d\nRivera is a contributing editor at The Wanderer and coeditor of the anthology of bilingual broadsides by contemporary Puerto Rico poets, Puerto Rico en mi coraz\u00f3n (2017). They are the 2018\u201319 poet laureate of Philadelphia and a co-organizer of the festival We (Too) Are Philly.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Caribbean", "U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
