She earned an MFA from the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop in 1971. She is the author of many books of poems, including That Said: New and Selected Poems (2012); A Yes-or-No Answer (2008), winner of the 2010 Poets\u2019 Prize; Happy Family (1999); Music Minus One (1996), a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award; The Minute Hand (1987), awarded the 1986 Lamont Prize; and Eye Level (1977), winner of the Juniper Prize. Shore has received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Radcliffe Institute, the Hodder at Princeton University, the Foxcroft School, and twice from the National Endowment for the Arts.\u00a0She is a professor at The George Washington University and lives in Washington, DC, and in Vermont.\nShore writes poems that are \u201cmemorabilia; they cultivate the leisure and faceted pleasure of retrospection; they favor the miniature and the artifactual; they are tender toward kitsch,\u201d to quote a reviewer in Poetry magazine. Her interests, almost always autobiographical and pertinent to her cultural Jewish heritage, are, according to a Virginia Quarterly Review correspondent, \u201ccarefully constructed and restrained, in a voice that maintains a deceptively calm and even tone.\u201d\nThe poems in her first collection, Eye Level (1977), range in locale from Vermont to Haiti and make universal observations based on such mundane items as Advent calendars and paperweights. \u201cJane Shore is a new voice in American poetry, and her first book is an outstanding collection,\u201d declared a Choice reviewer. In his Poetry piece on the volume, David Bromwich noted that Shore \u201cgives something of herself while holding back something, in keeping with her economy; the gift is there for us to peek at but not to display (it was not meant for display); it is a delight to have around the house, and makes us wonder what her patience will bring next.\u201d A New York Times Book Review contributor noted that in Eye Level the poet\u2019s concerns \u201care the strictures and surprises of seeing, and her typical emotional texture is one of detachment, mixed with occasional tension and regret.\u201d The critic observed that Shore \u201cescapes the more obvious weakness of much faddish poetry. ... Her privileged viewers\u2014Lot\u2019s wife, an astronaut, the Creole maid in Port-au-Prince\u2014extend her own vision.\u201d\nCritics have been equally praiseworthy of Shore\u2019s subsequent collections. Kliatt contributor James Beschta called the poems in The Minute Hand (1987) \u201csophisticated,\u201d adding that throughout the work \u201cboth the craft and the cleverness of the poet are obvious.\u201d A Poetry reviewer noted that in The Minute Hand \u201cthe poet recycles the variegated vestments of collective imagination, that she may stitch her own affectionate connections with the past and with human community.\u201d In Publishers Weekly, a correspondent deemed Music Minus One (1996) \u201ca virtuoso performance\u201d in which the poet \u201ccaptures the nuances of an intense childhood lived as if every decision will be crucial for the lives around her.\u201d Judy Clarence, writing in the Library Journal, called Shore \u201cone of the most accessible poets writing today,\u201d concluding that in Music Minus One Shore demonstrates \u201ca wonderful knack for narrative and spins out her tales with moving, compelling richness.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
