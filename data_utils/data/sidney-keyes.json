He published his only two collections while studying at the Queen\u2019s College, Oxford University on a history scholarship. Following his graduation, he joined the British Army in 1942 and continued writing poetry until 1943, when he was killed in Tunisia while covering his platoon\u2019s retreat. He was 20 years old.\nSince his death, Keyes has been acknowledged as a major English poet of World War II. Clive James writes that his work is often marked by \u201csudden intensity,\u201d and Carol Rumen suggests that Keyes work verse is \u201ccandid, unsentimental,\u201d and \u201cfree of imitative gestures.\u201d His work was gathered into Collected Poems (1988).\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
