He is counted among the three great 17th-century French dramatists, along with Moli\u00e8re and Racine. His many works include Polyeucte (1643), Cinna (1641), Horace (1640), and Le Cid (1637), which is regarded as the most notable play in the history of French drama.\nIn 1647, Corneille moved to Paris, where he was admitted to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise.\u00a0He continued to write during the civil war of the period known as the Fronde (1648\u201353), receiving mixed reviews.
