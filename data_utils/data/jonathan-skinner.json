He earned a PhD in English from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 2005. His collection of poems, Political Cactus Poems (2005), was printed by Palm Press using an ecologically responsible printing process.  \u00a0 In Rain Taxi Review of Books, reviewer Francis Raven described the poems in Political Cactus Poems as \u201cfirmly rooted in our current world, while using many strategies in the tradition of experimental ecopoetics.\u201d For example, the series \u201cLittle Dictionary of Sounds\u201d is based on recorded sounds; text and image interact throughout the book as well. Poems about various cacti are accompanied by photos of cactus sculptures created by Isabelle Pelissier, Skinner\u2019s wife. \u00a0 Skinner edited the journal ecopoetics from 2001 to 2005 and writes ecocriticism on contemporary poetry.\u00a0A former Professor of Environmental Studies at Bates College, Skinner teaches in the Department of English and Comparative Literary Studies and in the Writing Program at the University of Warwick.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
