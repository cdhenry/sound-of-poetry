Her father was a yeoman and her mother died when Blamire was seven; when her father remarried, Susanna and her siblings went to live with their aunt, Mrs. Mary Stevenson Simpson. Most accounts describe the Simpson household as being festive and filled with music and dancing. Susanna Blamire accompanied her newly married sister Sarah to Scotland in 1767, where she remained for several years. She also visited London and Ireland.\nBlamire wrote Scottish songs, including \u201cThe Siller Croun\u201d and \u201cThe Nabob,\u201d poems in Standard English, and poems in the Cumberland dialect. Her first dated poem is \u201cWritten in a Churchyard, on seeing a number of cattle grazing in it\u201d (1766); she is also the author of the 1,156-line poem \u201cStocklewath; or, The Cumbrian Village.\u201d Blamire\u2019s poetry is accessible and often concerned with the lives of working people. Her poetry and songs were written for friends, not for publication; her sister preserved Blamire\u2019s work, and it was first published in 1842.\u00a0Susanna Blamire suffered from a heart and lung condition and died in Carlisle.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Scotland"], "School/Period:": ["Augustan"]}}
