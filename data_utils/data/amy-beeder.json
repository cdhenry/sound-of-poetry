Kennedy noted that while \u201csickness and death are \u2026 recurrent themes\u201d in Burn the Field, the \u201ccounterthrust of Beeder\u2019s musical rhythms and striking imagery suggest that her project is to make beautiful metaphor of our dangerous world.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nBeeder\u2019s honors include a 2001 \u201cDiscovery\u201d/The Nation Award, a Bread Loaf Scholarship, and an award from the Emerging Writers Network. Her poems have appeared in AGNI, American Letters & Commentary, Black Warrior Review, The Nation, Poetry, and Puerto del Sol. She has taught at the University of New Mexico and the Taos Summer Writers\u2019 Conference and has served as an editor for Blue Mesa Review. She lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
