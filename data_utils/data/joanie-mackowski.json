She received a BA from Wesleyan University, was a Stegner Fellow in Poetry at Stanford University, and received a PhD from the University of Missouri. A professor at Cornell University, she has worked as a French translator, a journalist in the San Francisco Bay Area, and a juggler. She is the winner of the 2003 Kate Tufts Discovery award, and the 2008 Writer Magazine/Emily Dickinson award.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHer poetry is marked by precise details and attention to the sounds of language; the lines of her poems echo with slant and internal rhymes. Sometimes eerie and often grounded in scientific facts, her poetry scrutinizes insects, plants, animals, and the self. Of her work, Mackowski has said, \u201cI try to ask questions about what makes us separate individuals and also about what brings us together, in love or in community.\u201d She lives in upstate New York.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
