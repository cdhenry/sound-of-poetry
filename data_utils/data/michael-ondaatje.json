He lived in England as a child, and when he was 18, he moved to Canada,\u00a0where he now lives with his wife, the novelist Linda Spalding. He earned a BA from the University of Toronto and an MA from Queens University. He has received many awards for his work, including two Governor\u2019s General Awards and the Booker Prize for\u00a0his novel\u00a0The English Patient \u00a0(1992).\u00a0He is the author of the poetry collections\u00a0The Story\u00a0(2006),\u00a0Handwriting\u00a0(1999),\u00a0The Cinnamon Peeler: Selected Poems\u00a0(1991),\u00a0Secular Love\u00a0(1984),\u00a0There\u2019s a Trick with a Knife I\u2019m Learning to Do: Poems, 1963-1978, and\u00a0The Collected Works of Billy the Kid\u00a0(1970), among others.\nOndaatje is known for work that dissolves the lines between prose and poetry, past and present, image and intellect, thought\u00a0and feeling. \u201cMoving in and out of imagined landscape, portrait and documentary, anecdote or legend, Ondaatje writes for the eye and the ear simultaneously,\u201d noted Diane Wakoski in\u00a0Contemporary Poets.\nWhether retelling an American myth in\u00a0The Collected Works of Billy the Kid\u00a0(1973), reshaping recollections of friends and family from his childhood in old Ceylon in\u00a0Running in the Family\u00a0(1982), or delving into the brutality of Sri Lanka\u2019s decades-long civil war in\u00a0Anil\u2019s Ghost\u00a0(2000),\u00a0Ondaatje displays a keen understanding of the internal struggles of his characters, using a poetic writing style that depends upon juxtaposition, startling imagery and intense, often difficult, language. A well-regarded poet before he turned\u00a0to fiction, Ondaatje\u2019s work in both genres is sensual and rich.\u00a0\nCritics note that although Ondaatje\u2019s poetry continually evolves as he embraces risk and formal experimentation, he work maintains focus on the myths that root deep in common cultural experience. As a poet, he is deeply invested in depicting the affinity between the art of legend and the world at large. \u201cHe cares more about the relationship between art and nature than any other poet since the Romantics,\u201d stated Liz Rosenberg in\u00a0New York Times Book Review,\u00a0\u201cand more than most contemporary poets care about any ideas at all.\u201d\nOndaatje\u2019s early poetry, collected in the volume\u00a0There\u2019s a Trick with a Knife I\u2019m Learning to Do: Poems, 1963\u20131978, merges the surreal and the everyday. Charles Molesworth noted in the\u00a0New York Times that\u00a0Ondaatje writes poetry that \u201crelies on a hushed approach.\u201d Generally considered his first major work,\u00a0The Collected Works of Billy the Kid\u00a0(1970) is formally ambitious. Through a combination of lyric poetry, prose, snippets of a play, songs, mock-interviews and photographs, this book investigates both Billy the Kid and the consequences of myth.\nNew York Times Book Review\u00a0contributor Adam Kirsch noted that Ondaatje\u2019s collection Handwriting\u00a0(1999) \u201cuses the serene juxtapositions of haiku \u2026 to eliminate the need for explanation and exposition, leaving us with the things themselves.\u201d Drawing on the history and mythology of China, India, and his native Sri Lanka,\u00a0Handwriting\u00a0shows Ondaatje\u2019s style at its most fragmented, though as Henry Taylor wrote in\u00a0Poetry,\u00a0\u201csingularly appropriate to the themes and subjects of the book, which arise from mixed heritage and the loss of cultural identity.\u201d\u00a0The Story\u00a0(2006) pairs poems on childhood, mythology and love with watercolors by the artist David Bolducan. The book was commissioned by the World Literacy Project in Canada.\nOndaatje\u2019s fame as a novelist skyrocketed after his best-selling novel\u00a0The English Patient\u00a0(1992)\u00a0was adapted into an Academy Award-winning film.\u00a0Set in an Italian villa at the end of World War II, the novel foregrounds Ondaatje\u2019s linguistic prowess. As Cressida Connolly noted in the\u00a0Spectator, \u201cThe writing is so heady that you have to keep putting the book down between passages so as not to reel from the sheer force and beauty of it. \u2026 when I finished the book I felt as dazed as if I\u2019d just awoken from a powerful dream.\u201d Conolly ranked Ondaatje among such contemporary novelists as Ian McEwan and Martin Amis. Ondaatje\u2019s other novels have also received high praise, including his first,\u00a0Coming Through Slaughter\u00a0(1976), a poetic treatment of the early Jazz legend Buddy Bolden. As Diane Watson noted in\u00a0Contemporary Novelists,\u00a0Ondaatje is \u201cconcerned always to focus on the human, the private, and the \u2018real\u2019 over the theoretical and the ideological,\u201d in his novels and short fiction. In novels like\u00a0In the Skin of a Lion (1987),\u00a0which focuses on immigrants in early 20th-century Toronto, and\u00a0Anil\u2019s Ghost (2000),\u00a0which takes on the troubled history of modern Sri Lanka, \u201cOndaatje examines the internal workings of characters who struggle against and burst through that which renders people passive and which renders human experience programmatic and static,\u201d wrote Watson. Reviewers have noted that Ondaatje\u2019s novels, including Divisiadero\u00a0(2007), have been \u201cnovels\u201d in name only; Ondaatje\u2019s attentiveness to beauty, despair, and individuals inform his narratives even as his potent language and circular structures often pull the books towards poetry.\nIn addition to writing novels, plays, and poetry collections, Ondaatje has edited several books, including\u00a0The Faber Book of Contemporary Canadian Short Stories\u00a0(1990).\u00a0His memoir, Running in the Family (1982), complements stories about his family with poems and photographs. He has also written books of nonfiction, including\u00a0The Conversations: Walter Murch and the Art of Film Editing\u00a0(2002), which was highly praised by reviewers for its insight into the creative process. Both Ondaatje and Murch, who has worked with Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, talk about the task of revealing hidden themes and patterns in existing creative works. As Ondaatje noted in an interview with\u00a0Maclean\u2019s, editing\u2014whether of film or one\u2019s written work, is \u201cthe only place where you\u2019re on your own. Where you can be one person and govern it. The only time you control making a movie is in the editing stage.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Canada"]}}
