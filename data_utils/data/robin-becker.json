She taught for many years at the MIT before returning to Pennsylvania in 1994, where she is\u00a0Liberal Arts Research Professor of English and Women\u2019s Studies at Penn State.\n\r\nBecker\u2019s many collections of poetry include Personal Effects (1977); Backtalk (1982); Giacometti\u2019s Dog (1990); All-American Girl (1996), which won a Lambda Literary Award; The Horse Fair (2000);\u00a0Domain of Perfect Affection (2006); Tiger Heron (2014); and The Black Bear Inside Me (2018). Becker\u2019s range of subjects has been described as a \u201cvibrant miscellany.\u201d Her poems reflect her Russian-Jewish heritage and queer identity, her interest in art history and visual art, the experience of growing up in 1950s America, and the legacy of the 1960s. In The Horse Fair, her subjects range from the painter Rosa Bonheur to the Torah and personal tragedies. Poet Kathleen Aguero has said that Becker\u2019s poems are \u201crichly populated by friends, lovers, family\u201d as they \u201cchronicle a search for community.\u201d\n\r\nBecker\u2019s interest in narrative springs from her family background, including a childhood spent listening to her grandmother\u2019s stories, learning from her the nuances of storytelling and her family\u2019s history in Ukraine. Becker was also greatly influenced by the women writers whose poetry was available in the 1970s, including Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde, Maxine Kumin, Denise Levertov, and Susan Griffin. Poet Stephen Dunn regards Becker as achieving \u201cwhat may be one of the early twenty first century\u2019s most difficult accomplishments\u2014to write a credible poetry of affirmation. In the doing, she doesn\u2019t pretty up the world. Rather, she finds language that embraces our dualities, our many-selved presences, regularly demonstrating her kind of perfect affection.\u201d\n\r\nBecker\u2019s work has appeared widely in magazines and journals, including American Poetry Review, the Boston Globe, Georgia Review, Kenyon Review, and Prairie Schooner. She is a contributing editor to Ploughshares and poetry editor for the Women\u2019s Review of Books, where she writes a column called \u201cField Notes.\u201d\u00a0Becker also teaches workshops at the Fine Arts Center in Provincetown. She has won fellowships from the Bunting Institute, the Massachusetts Artists Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts. In 2000 she was honored with Penn State's George W. Atherton Award for Excellence in Teaching, and she served as Penn State Laureate in 2010-11.\n\n\r\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
