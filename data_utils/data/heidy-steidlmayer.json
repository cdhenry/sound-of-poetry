Zacharis Award from Ploughshares and the Kate Tufts Discovery Award. Her poems have appeared in Poetry, TriQuarterly, Ploughshares,\u00a0The Cortland Review, Literary Imagination,\u00a0and Michigan Quarterly Review, among others, and in Poems, Poets, Poetry: An Introduction and Anthology, by Helen Vendler (Bedford/St. Martin\u2019s, 2002). Of Steidlmayer\u2019s work Christian Wiman has written, \u201cShe is a remarkable poet (who) writes poems of great compactness and density, as technically accomplished as they are emotionally devastating. This is an age of irony and sprawl, and she's going \u2013 bravely and with great success \u2013 her own way. People may not know much about her work now, but they will soon.\u201d Steidlmayer has been awarded the J. Howard and Barbara M.J. Wood Prize from Poetry magazine and a Rona Jaffe Foundation Writers\u2019 Award.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
