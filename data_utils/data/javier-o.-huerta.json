Huerta was born in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico, and immigrated to Houston, Texas, in 1981. He is a graduate of the bilingual MFA program at the University of Texas at El Paso. Huerta\u2019s debut collection, Some Clarifications y otros poemas (2007), received the 31st Chicano/Latino Literary Prize from the University of California, Irvine. He also authored American Copia: An Immigrant Epic (2012). The immigration and bicultural experience is essential to his work; the first line of his debut collection, \u201cToday I\u2019m going to the grocery store,\u201d is the sentence Huerta was given to write during his naturalization interview to become a US citizen. On writing for a bilingual audience, Huerta says, \u201cThe bilingual pun, I believe, is central to the tradition of Chicano poetry. \u2026 I like to think that the Chicano bilingual pun is not simply a result of poetic wit. I like to think that it is a result of everyday misunderstandings, misreadings, mistranslations, and mispronunciations.\u201d\nHuerta teaches and is a PhD candidate at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies poetry of the 19th century.\n", "attrs": {}}
