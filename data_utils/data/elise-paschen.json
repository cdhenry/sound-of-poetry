She earned a BA at Harvard University, where she won the Lloyd McKim Garrison Medal and the Joan Grey Untermeyer Poetry Prize, and went on to earn a PhD in 20th-century British and American Literature at Oxford University, with a dissertation on the manuscripts of poet\u00a0William Butler Yeats. During her time at Oxford she also co-edited\u00a0Oxford Poetry.\n\r\nInfluenced by the work of both Yeats and\u00a0Elizabeth Bishop, Paschen\u2019s poems often engage the intersection of the mythic and the domestic. As the daughter of Osage prima ballerina Maria Tallchief, Paschen has discussed the importance of \u201cfamily romance\u201d to her origins as a writer. In an interview with the\u00a0Valparaiso Poetry Review, she noted, \u201cIt is a myth I attempt to fathom and understand. As an only child, I often discovered refuge in the world of the imagination \u2026 After I learned how to write\u2014literally when I was seven years old\u2014I was able to convert those imaginings into my attempts at plays, stories, and poems.\u201d\n\r\nPaschen, an enrolled member of the Osage Nation, has published several collections of poetry, including The Nightlife (2017),\u00a0Bestiary\u00a0(2009), Infidelities\u00a0(1996), winner of the Nicholas Roerich Poetry Prize, and Houses: Coasts (1985). She is the editor of The Eloquent Poem (2019),\u00a0Poetry Speaks Who I Am\u00a0(2010) and\u00a0Poetry Speaks to Children\u00a0(2005), and the co-editor of\u00a0Poetry Speaks Expanded (2007), Poetry Speaks\u00a0(2001), Poetry in Motion from Coast to Coast (2002) and\u00a0Poetry in Motion\u00a0(1996). Her own work has been included in numerous anthologies including\u00a0The Best American Poetry 2018, Native Voices: Indigenous American Poetry, Craft and Conversations,\u00a0The Poetry Anthology: 1912-2002,\u00a0and\u00a0A Formal Feeling Comes: Poems in Form by Contemporary Women.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPaschen has served as the Executive Director of the Poetry Society of America. She co-founded the\u00a0Poetry in Motion\u00a0program, which posts poems in subways and buses. She has been the Frances Allen Fellow of the Newberry Library and has received the Rupert Costo Chair in American Indian Affairs Medal.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPaschen lives with her family in Chicago where she teaches in the MFA Writing Program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
