She studied at Howard University, before transferring to SUNY Fredonia, near her hometown. She was discovered as a poet by Langston Hughes (via friend Ishmael Reed, who shared her poems), and Hughes published Clifton's poetry in his highly influential anthology, The Poetry of the Negro (1970). A prolific and widely respected poet, Lucille Clifton\u2019s work emphasizes endurance and strength through adversity, focusing particularly on African-American experience and family life. Awarding the prestigious Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize to Clifton in 2007, the judges remarked that \u201cOne always feels the looming humaneness around Lucille Clifton\u2019s poems\u2014it is a moral quality that some poets have and some don\u2019t.\u201d In addition to the Ruth Lilly prize, Clifton was the first author to have two books of poetry chosen as finalists for the Pulitzer Prize,\u00a0Good Woman: Poems and a Memoir, 1969-1980\u00a0(1987) and\u00a0Next: New Poems\u00a0(1987).\u00a0Her collection\u00a0Two-Headed Woman\u00a0(1980) was also a Pulitzer nominee and won the Juniper Prize from the University of Massachusetts. She served as the state of Maryland\u2019s poet laureate from 1974 until 1985, and won the prestigious National Book Award for\u00a0Blessing the Boats: New and Selected Poems, 1988-2000.\u00a0In addition to her numerous poetry collections, she wrote many children\u2019s books. Clifton was a Distinguished Professor of Humanities at St. Mary\u2019s College of Maryland and a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. Her writing covered countless subjects in important ways, leading her poetry to be read by people with a wide variety of backgrounds and interests.\n\r\nClifton is noted for saying much with few words. In a\u00a0Christian Century\u00a0review of Clifton\u2019s work, Peggy Rosenthal wrote, \u201cThe first thing that strikes us about Lucille Clifton\u2019s poetry is what is missing: capitalization, punctuation, long and plentiful lines. We see a poetry so pared down that its spaces take on substance, become a shaping presence as much as the words themselves.\u201d In an\u00a0American Poetry Review\u00a0article about Clifton\u2019s work,\u00a0Robin Becker\u00a0commented on Clifton\u2019s lean style: \u201cClifton\u2019s poetics of understatement\u2014no capitalization, few strong stresses per line, many poems totaling fewer than twenty lines, the sharp rhetorical question\u2014includes the essential only.\u201d Poet Elizabeth Alexander praised Clifton\u2019s ability to write \u201cphysically small poems with enormous and profound inner worlds\u201d in the New Yorker. \nClifton\u2019s first volume of poetry,\u00a0Good Times\u00a0(1969),\u00a0was named one of the 10 best books of the year by the\u00a0New York Times. The poems, inspired by Clifton\u2019s family of six young children, show the beginnings of Clifton\u2019s spare, unadorned style and center around the facts of African-American urban life. Clifton\u2019s second volume of poetry,\u00a0Good News about the Earth: New Poems\u00a0(1972),\u00a0was written in the midst of the political and social upheavals of the late 1960s and 70s, and its poems reflect those changes, including a middle sequence that pays homage to black political leaders. Writing in\u00a0Poetry,\u00a0Ralph J. Mills, Jr., said that Clifton\u2019s poetic scope transcends the black experience \u201cto embrace the entire world, human and non-human, in the deep affirmation she makes in the teeth of negative evidence.\u201d However,\u00a0An Ordinary Woman\u00a0(1974),\u00a0Clifton\u2019s third collection of poems, largely abandoned the examination of racial issues that had marked her previous books, looking instead at the writer\u2019s roles as woman and poet. Helen Vendler declared in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0that Clifton \u201crecalls for us those bare places we have all waited as \u2018ordinary women,\u2019 with no choices but yes or no, no art, no grace, no words, no reprieve.\u201d Generations: A Memoir\u00a0(1976) is an \u201celoquent eulogy of [Clifton\u2019s] parents,\u201d Reynolds Price wrote in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review,\u00a0adding that, \u201cas with most elegists, her purpose is perpetuation and celebration, not judgment \u2026 There is no sustained chronological narrative. Instead, clusters of brief anecdotes gather round two poles, the deaths of father and mother.\u201d The book was later collected in\u00a0Good Woman: Poems and a Memoir: 1969-1980, which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize along with\u00a0Next: New Poems\u00a0(1987).\nThe book that followed Clifton\u2019s dual Pulitzer nomination,\u00a0Quilting: Poems 1987-1990\u00a0(1991),\u00a0also won widespread critical acclaim Using a quilt as a metaphor for life, each poem is a story, bound together through history and figuratively sewn with the thread of experience. They\u2019re divided into sections, each with a the name of a conventional quilt design\u2014\u201cEight-pointed Star\u201d and \u201cTree of Life.\u201d Clifton\u2019s main focus is on women\u2019s history; however, according to Robert Mitchell in\u00a0American Book Review, her poetry has a far broader range: \u201cHer heroes include nameless slaves buried on old plantations, Hector Pieterson (the first child killed in the Soweto riot), Fannie Lou Hamer (founder of the Mississippi Peace and Freedom Party), Nelson and Winnie Mandela, W.E.B. DuBois, Huey P. Newton, and many other people who gave their lives to [free] black people from slavery and prejudice.\u201d\n\r\nEnthusiasts of\u00a0Quilting\u00a0included critic Bruce Bennett in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review,\u00a0who praised Clifton as a \u201cpassionate, mercurial writer, by turns angry, prophetic, compassionate, shrewd, sensuous, vulnerable and funny. \u2026 The movement and effect of the whole book communicate the sense of a journey through which the poet achieves an understanding of something new.\u201d Clifton\u2019s 1993 poetry collection,\u00a0The Book of Light,\u00a0contains poems on subjects ranging from bigotry and intolerance, epitomized by a poem about controversial U.S. Senator Jesse Helms; destruction, including a poem about the tragic bombing by police of a MOVE compound in Philadelphia in 1985; religion, characterized by a sequence of poems featuring a dialogue between God and the devil; and mythology, rendered by poems about figures like Atlas and Superman. \u201cIf this poet\u2019s art has deepened since ...\u00a0Good Times,\u00a0it\u2019s in an increased capacity for quiet delicacy and fresh generalization,\u201d remarked\u00a0Poetry\u00a0contributor Calvin Bedient, who argued that when Clifton writes without \u201canger and sentimentality, she writes at her remarkable best.\u201d Lockett concluded that the collection is \u201ca gift of joy, a truly illuminated manuscript by a writer whose powers have been visited by grace.\u201d\n\r\nBoth\u00a0The Terrible Stories\u00a0(1996) and\u00a0Blessing the Boats: New and Selected Poems, 1988-2000\u00a0(2000) shed light upon women\u2019s survival skills in the face of ill health, family upheaval, and historic tragedy.\u00a0Blessing the Boats\u00a0is a compilation of four Clifton books, plus new poems, which, Becker noted in the American Poetry Review, \u201cshows readers how the poet\u2019s themes and formal structures develop over time.\u201d Among the pieces collected in these volumes are several about the author\u2019s breast cancer. She also deals with juvenile violence, child abuse, biblical characters, dreams, the legacy of slavery, and a shaman-like empathy with animals as varied as foxes, squirrels, and crabs. She also speaks in a number of voices, as noted by Becker, including \u201cangel, Eve, Lazarus, Leda, Lot\u2019s Wife, Lucifer, among others ... as she probes the narratives that undergird western civilization and forges new ones.\u201d\n\r\nA\u00a0Publishers Weekly\u00a0reviewer concluded that the collection \u201cdistills a distinctive American voice, one that pulls no punches in taking on the best and worst of life.\u201d The volume was awarded the National Book Award. Renee Olson reported on the award for\u00a0Booklist\u00a0that \u201cClifton was cited for evoking \u2018the struggle, beauty, and passion of one woman\u2019s life with such clarity and power that her vision becomes representative, communal, and unforgettable.\u2019\u201d In\u00a0Mercy\u00a0(2004),\u00a0Clifton\u2019s 12th book of poetry, the poet writes about the relationship between mothers and daughters, terrorism, prejudice, and personal faith. Clifton\u2019s next book,\u00a0Voices\u00a0(2008), includes short verses personifying objects, as well as poems on more familiar terrain. Reviewing the book for the\u00a0Baltimore Sun, Diane Scharper commented on the impetus of Clifton\u2019s title: \u201cEach section explores the ways the poet relates to voices: from those spoken by inanimate objects to those remembered to those \u2018overheard\u2019 in the titles of pictures. Serving as a medium, the poet speaks not only for those things that have no voice, but also for the feelings associated with them.\u201d\nLucille Clifton was also a highly-regarded author for children. Her many books for children were designed to help them understand their world and African-American heritage. In books like\u00a0All Us Come Cross the Water\u00a0(1973), Clifton created the context to raise awareness of African-American history and heritage. Her most famous creation, though, was Everett Anderson, an African-American boy living in a big city. Clifton went on to publish eight Everett Anderson titles, including\u00a0Everett Anderson\u2019s Goodbye\u00a0(1984), which won the Coretta Scott King Award. Connecting Clifton\u2019s work as a children\u2019s author to her poetry, Jocelyn K. Moody\u00a0wrote in the\u00a0Oxford Companion to African American Literature: \u201cLike her poetry, Clifton\u2019s short fiction extols the human capacity for love, rejuvenation, and transcendence over weakness and malevolence even as it exposes the myth of the American dream.\u201d\nSpeaking to Michael S. Glaser in an interview for the\u00a0Antioch Review,\u00a0Clifton reflected that she continues to write, because \u201cwriting is a way of continuing to hope ... perhaps for me it is a way of remembering I am not alone.\u201d How would Clifton like to be remembered? \u201cI would like to be seen as a woman whose roots go back to Africa, who tried to honor being human. My inclination is to try to help.\u201d\nClifton died February 13, 2010, in Baltimore.\n", "attrs": {}}
