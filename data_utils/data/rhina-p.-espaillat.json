Espaillat was born in the Dominican Republic under the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo. After Espaillat\u2019s great-uncle opposed the regime, her family was exiled to the United States and settled in New York City. She began writing poetry as a young girl\u2014in Spanish and then English\u2014and has published in both languages.\nEspaillat\u2019s numerous poetry collections include And After All (2019); Her Place in These Designs (2008); Playing at Stillness (2005); Rehearsing Absence (2001), recipient of the 2001 Richard Wilbur Award; a bilingual chapbook titled Mundo y Palabra/The World and the Word (2001); Where Horizons Go (1998), winner of the T.S. Eliot Prize; and Lapsing to Grace (1992).\nOn Rehearsing Absence, Robert B. Shaw wrote in Poetry, \u201cTo Rhina Espaillat the quotidian is no malady \u2026 it is the source of inspiration. Hers is a voice of experience, but it is neither jaded nor pedantic. She speaks not from some cramped corner but from somewhere close to the center of life.\u201d Awarding Espaillat the 1998 T.S. Eliot Prize for Where Horizons Go, X.J. Kennedy noted that \u201csuch developed skill and such mastery of rhyme and meter are certainly rare anymore; so is plainspeaking.\u201d\nEspaillat\u2019s work has garnered many awards, including the Sparrow Sonnet Prize, three Poetry Society of America prizes, the Der-Hovanessian Translation Prize, and\u2014for her Spanish translations of Robert Frost\u2014the Robert Frost Foundation\u2019s Tree at My Window Award. She is a two-time winner of The Formalist\u2019s Howard Nemerov Sonnet Award and the recipient of a 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award from Salem State College. She is a founding member of the Fresh Meadows Poets and a founding member and former director of the Powow River Poets. For over a decade, she coordinated the Newburyport Art Association\u2019s Annual Poetry Contest.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
