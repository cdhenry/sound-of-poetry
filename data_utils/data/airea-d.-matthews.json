Matthews is the author of the poetry collection Simulacra, winner of the 2016 Yale Series of Younger Poets Prize. New Yorker critic Dan Chiasson describes Matthews's experimental forms in\u00a0Simulacra\u00a0as \u201cFugues, text messages to the dead, imagined outtakes from Wittgenstein, tart mini-operas, fairy tales: Matthews is virtuosic, frantic, and darkly, very darkly, funny.\u201d\nMatthews's work has appeared in\u00a0Callaloo, Best American Poets 2015,\u00a0Harvard Review, American Poet, and elsewhere. She was awarded a 2016 Rona Jaffe Writer\u2019s Foundation Award, the 2016 Louis Untermeyer Scholarship from Bread Loaf Writers\u2019 Conference, a 2015 Kresge Literary Arts award as well as fellowships from Cave Canem, Callaloo, and the James Merrill House. Her current projects include a second book,\u00a0under/class, which seeks to lyrically deconstruct the accepted narratives around poverty and class.\u00a0She is an assistant professor at Bryn Mawr College where she directs the creative writing program.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
