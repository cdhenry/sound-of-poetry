She has also authored several chapbooks, including Orizaba: A Voyage with Hart Crane (2008), Stacy S.: Autoportraits (2008), and\u00a0 from Hart Island (2009).\r\n\u00a0\r\nSzymaszek\u2019s work encompasses a variety of voices and personas, eros, and queer identity. Hyperglossia references ancient Egyptian healing and makes use of wordplay and anagrams. Szymaszek commented in an interview with Susie DeFord for Bombsite.com: \u201c\u2018Hyperglossia\u2019 refers to the narrator\u2019s attempt to tell her autobiography post\u2013head trauma [.\u2026] She\u2019s not able to use language in a socially acceptable manner, and, through the book, her language is structured as close to the way the mind works as possible. She honors the nonsense, the nonlinearity, the ruse, the erroneous.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn addition to frequently serving as a teacher for Naropa University's Summer Writing Program and as a mentor for Queer Art, Szymazek has previously worked at Woodland Pattern Book Center in Milwaukee and is currently the director of the Poetry Project in New York City.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
