In addition to her poetry, Woolsey published children\u2019s stories, including The New Year\u2019s Bargain (1871) and What Katy Did (1872). Her series of Katy books, which fea\u00adture a mischievous, strong-willed young heroine and her siblings, loosely modeled after Woolsey\u2019s family and upbringing, brought her lasting popularity in the United States and England; they remain in print to this day.
