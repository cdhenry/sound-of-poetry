She studied philosophy and literature at the University of Buenos Aires before dropping out to pursue painting and her own poetry. In 1960, she moved to Paris, where she befriended writers such as Octavio Paz, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, and Silvina Ocampo. Considered one of mid-century Argentina\u2019s most powerful and intense lyric poets, Pizarnik counted among her influences H\u00f6lderlin and, as she wrote in \u201cThe Incarnate Word,\u201d an essay from 1965, \u201cthe suffering of Baudelaire, the suicide of Nerval, the premature silence of Rimbaud, the mysterious and fleeting presence of Lautr\u00e9amont,\u201d and the \u201cunparalleled intensity\u201d of Artaud\u2019s \u201cphysical and moral suffering.\u201d Pizarnik\u2019s themes were cruelty, childhood, estrangement, and death. According to Emily Cooke, Pizarnik \u201cwas perennially mistrustful of her medium, seeming sometimes more interested in silence than in language, and the poetic style she cultivated was terse and intentionally unbeautiful.\u201d Her work has continually attracted new readers since her suicide at age 36.\nPizarnik published several books of poetry during her lifetime, including: La tierra m\u00e1s ajena (1955), La \u00faltima inocencia (1956), Las aventuras perdidas (1958), \u00c1rbol de Diana (1960), Extracci\u00f3n de la piedra de locura (1968), and El infierno musical (1971). She also published the prose essay \u201cLa condesa sangrienta\u201d (1971), a meditation on a 16th-century Hungarian countess allegedly responsible for the torture and murder of more than 600 girls. Pizarnik\u2019s work has been translated into English in the collections Alejandra Pizarnik: Selected Poems (translated by Cecilia Rossi, 2010) and Extracting the Stone of Madness (translated by Yvette Siegert, 2016).\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Latin America"]}}
