Educated at the City College of the City University of New York and Columbia University, Kelly is known as a founder of the Deep Image movement, which he described in a 2006 interview as \u201cthe journey to the depths with language as our only tool and music our only weapon.\u201d Kelly\u2019s more than 50 collections of poetry include Armed Descent (1961); Kill the Messenger Who Brings Bad News (1980), chosen as the Los Angeles Times Book of the Year; Red Actions: Selected Poems 1960\u20131993 (1995); and May Day (2007). Bookforum critic Joseph Donahue, praising Lapis (2005), noted that Kelly \u201chas given magic back its dignity, finding it in human warmth.\u201d Kelly\u2019s free-verse poetry, both spare in language and wide-ranging in its attention, is often engaged with the intimacy of audience: the connection forged between individuals looking outward together.Kelly co-founded, with George Economou, both Trobar and the Chelsea Review (now Chelsea), and has edited Matter.
