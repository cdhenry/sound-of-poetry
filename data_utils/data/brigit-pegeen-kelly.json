Born\u00a0in Palo Alto, California, Kelly received some of American poetry\u2019s most prestigious honors, including a Discovery/the Nation Award, the Yale Younger Poets Prize, a Whiting Writers Award, and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Academy of American Poets.\nKelly was the author of\u00a0To the Place of Trumpets\u00a0(1987),\u00a0selected by\u00a0James Merrill\u00a0for the Yale Series of Younger Poets Prize;\u00a0Song\u00a0(1995), winner of the Lamont Poetry Prize of the Academy of American Poets;\u00a0and\u00a0The\u00a0Orchard\u00a0(2004), a finalist for the\u00a0Los Angeles Times\u00a0Book Award in Poetry, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Pulitzer Prize.\u00a0In poems that frequently turn nature into a kind of myth, Kelly exposes both the glory and menace of animal and human life, birth and death, stasis and change. Over three books, she has created a style at once richly imagined and emotionally complex. Praising Kelly\u2019s work, poet Carl Phillips noted that \u201cher poems are like no one else\u2019s\u2014hard and luminous, weird in the sense of making a thing strange, that we at last might see it, poems that from book to book show a strength that flexes itself both formally and in terms of content, in ways that continue to, at equal turns, teach and surprise.\u201d\n\u201cThe religious imagination is part and parcel of Kelly\u2019s work,\u201d commented Stephen Yenser in the Yale Review. \u201cAlways in touch with the so-called natural world, her poems nonetheless present it ineluctably in Christian terms, whose implicit verities she invariably calls into question.\u201d Kelly\u2019s earliest book, To the Place of Trumpets, includes several poems that reflect her Catholic upbringing, including stained-glass angels coming to life. At times adopting a child\u2019s point of view, the book is a detailed vision of a world beginning to take shape unto itself; it points towards the larger themes and bigger, stranger landscapes that characterize her second and third books. While continuing to explore ritual, belief, and doubt, Kelly\u2019s later work has won praise for its stark, even shocking, portrayals of evil and transcendence. Using a menagerie of animals both real and invented, Kelly\u2019s later work explores the slippage between fact and fantasy. According to Carl Phillips, Kelly\u2019s self-imposed task has been to \u201cinvestigate why the world is so protean, pitching our human desire to empirically know a thing against a very real\u2014and in the world of Kelly\u2019s poems\u2014an otherworldly resistance to so-called rational thinking. The title poem in Song associates a haunting tune with the brutal killing of a girl\u2019s pet goat by a group of boys. The poem \u201cappropriately introduces the reader to some of the unexpected and compelling ways the poet achieves meaning and effect through the agency of music,\u201d wrote Robert Buttel in American Book Review. Comparing Song and The Orchard in the Guardian, Fiona Sampson noted that while they share similar themes and structures, The Orchard\u2019s \u201cdiction is thicker, less elegant. The poems are more clearly narrative and populated: the figure of a boy, in particular, recurs. By now it is clear that goat, doe, and all the rest are not merely statuary but animated myths. Kelly\u2019s Orchard is the dangerous grove where transformations happen.\u201d\n\r\nKelly taught at various colleges and universities, including the University of California-Irvine, Purdue University, Warren Wilson College, and\u00a0the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. She died in 2016.\r\n\ufeff\n", "attrs": {}}
