In her 2004 anthology The New Irish Poets, editor Selina Guinness discusses O\u2019Reilly\u2019s The Nowhere Birds, noting \u201cAlthough this book moves from childhood through adolescence and student travels to adult relationships, it charts this journey through a dream-world filled with natural imagery that either terrifies and repels, or that expresses libidinal desires intimately understood. At times eerie in their invocation of spiders, bats, and the claws of birds, these poems are drawn through such witch-like details to the edge of the known world, where they lift off into a surrealist vision of exemplary lyricism.\u201d  \u00a0 Her debut collection, The Nowhere Birds (2001),\u00a0was shortlisted for the Forward Prize for Best First Collection in 2001 and won the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature in 2002. Her second collection,\u00a0The Sea Cabinet\u00a0(2006), was a Poetry Book Society Recommendation and was shortlisted for the\u00a0Irish Times\u00a0Poetry Now Award in 2007.\u00a0Her newest volume,\u00a0Geis (2015), was chosen as one of\u00a0The Guardian\u2019s\u00a0Best Books of 2015.\u00a0 \u00a0 O\u2019Reilly, who has served as a contributing editor of the Irish poetry journal Metre and has also edited Poetry Ireland Review, works as a freelance writer and critic. She has taught at Wake Forest University and the Irish Writers\u2019 Center in Dublin. O\u2019Reilly divides her time between Wicklow and Dublin.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Ireland & Northern Ireland"]}}
