His work has appeared in many magazines and journals, including The Southern Review, The New Republic, Poetry magazine, The American Scholar, AGNI, The American Poetry Review, Ploughshares, Slate, The Paris Review, Poetry Daily, and The Threepenny Review, and The Yale Review. Critic Eric McHenry wrote in the New York Times Book Review, \"Kronen works extensively in fixed (and some feral) forms, but his lines, like Muldoon\u2019s, tend to be so metrically irregular and heavily enjambed that even the full rhymes barely register. It\u2019s a deliberately subdued music, more for the mind than for the ear. ... Kronen\u2019s skill with the figurative allows him to borrow figures from familiar sources (the Old Testament, classical mythology), apply them to familiar subjects, and still produce something original.\"\nA graduate of Warren Wilson\u2019s MFA program, Kronen has received an NEA fellowship, three Florida Individual Artist fellowships, the Cecil Hemley Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America, the James Boatwright Poetry Prize from Shenandoah, and fellowships from the Bread Loaf and Sewanee Writers\u2019 Conferences. He is a librarian in Miami, Florida, where he lives with his wife, the novelist Ivonne Lamazares.\n", "attrs": {}}
