Although he was one of the most prolific American poets of the early 20th century\u2014and his Collected Poems (1921) won the first Pulitzer Prize ever awarded to poetry\u2014he is remembered now for a few short poems. Robinson was devoted to his art and led a solitary, often make-shift existence; he published virtually nothing during his long career except poetry. Amy Lowell, a contemporary of Robinson, declared in the New York Times Book Review, \u201cEdwin Arlington Robinson is poetry. I can think of no other living writer who has so consistently dedicated his life to his work.\u201d In books such as The Torrent and the Night Before (1896; reprinted 1996), Captain Craig (1902; 1915), The Man Against the Sky (1916), King Jasper (1935), and particularly through the well-known Tilbury Town cycle, Robinson established a recognizable set of thematic and technical concerns: \u201cthemes of personal failure, artistic endeavor, materialism, and the inevitability of change,\u201d characterize much of his work, according to scholar Robert Gilbert. Robinson\u2019s use of laconic, everyday speech while also adhering to traditional forms at a time when most poets were experimenting with the genre also made his poetry unique. \u201cAll his life Robinson strenuously objected to free verse,\u201d Gilbert remarked, \u201creplying once when asked if he wrote it, \u2018No, I write badly enough as it is.\u2019\u201d\nThe third son of a wealthy New England merchant, Robinson seemed destined for a career in business or the sciences. His father did not encourage his son\u2019s literary talents, but Robinson wrote copiously as a young man, experimenting with verse translations from Greek and Latin poets. In 1891 Edward Robinson provided the funds to send his son to Harvard partly because the aspiring writer required medical treatment that could best be performed in Boston. There Robinson published some poems in local newspapers and magazines and, as he later explained in a biographical piece published in Colophon, collected a pile of rejection slips \u201cthat must have been one of the largest and most comprehensive in literary history.\u201d Finally he decided to publish his poems himself, and contracted with Riverside, a vanity press, to produce The Torrent and The Night Before, named after the first and last poems in the collection.\n\r\nRobinson mailed copies of The Torrent and The Night Before out \u201cto editors of journals and to writers who he thought might be sympathetic to his work,\u201d said Gilbert. The response was generally favorable, although perhaps the most significant review came from Harry Thurston Peck, who commented unfavorably in the Bookman on Robinson\u2019s bleak outlook and sense of humor. Peck found Robinson\u2019s tone too grim for his tastes, saying that \u201cthe world is not beautiful to [Robinson], but a prison-house.\u201d \u201cI am sorry that I have painted myself in such lugubrious colours,\u201d Robinson wrote in the next issue of the Bookman, responding to this criticism. \u201cThe world is not a prison house, but a kind of spiritual kindergarten, where millions of bewildered infants are trying to spell God with the wrong blocks.\u201d\n\r\nEncouraged by the largely positive critical reaction, Robinson quickly produced a second manuscript, The Children of the Night (1897), which was also published by a vanity press, a friend providing the necessary funds. Unfortunately, reviewers largely ignored it; Gilbert suggests that they were put off by the vanity imprint. In 1902, two friends persuaded the publisher Houghton Mifflin to publish Captain Craig, another book of Robinson\u2019s verse, by promising to subsidize part of the publishing costs. Captain Craig was neither a popular nor a critical success, and for several years Robinson neglected poetry, drifting from job to job in New York City and the Northeast. He took to drinking heavily, and for a time it seemed that he would, as Gilbert put it, fall \u201cinto permanent dissolution, as both his brothers had done.\u201d \u201cHis whimsical \u2018Miniver Cheevy,\u2019\u201d Gilbert continued, \u201cthe poem about the malcontent modern who yearned for the past glories of the chivalric age and who finally \u2018coughed, and called it fate/And kept on drinking,\u2019 is presumably a comic self-portrait.\u201d\n\r\nRobinson\u2019s luck changed in 1904, when Kermit Roosevelt brought The Children of the Night to the attention of his father, President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt not only persuaded Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons\u00a0to republish the book, but also reviewed it himself for the Outlook (\u201cI am not sure I understand \u2018Luke Havergal,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cbut I am entirely sure that I like it\u201d), and obtained a sinecure for its author at the New York Customs House\u2014a post Robinson held until 1909. The 2,000 dollar annual stipend that went with the post provided Robinson with financial security. In 1910, he repaid his debt to Roosevelt in The Town down the River (1910), a collection of poems dedicated to the former president.\n\r\nPerhaps the best known of Robinson\u2019s poems are those now called the Tilbury Town cycle, named after the small town \u201cthat provides the setting for many of his poems and explicitly links him and his poetry with small-town New England, the repressive, utilitarian social climate customarily designated as the Puritan ethic,\u201d explained W. R. Robinson in Edwin Arlington Robinson: A Poetry of the Act. These poems also expound some of Robinson\u2019s most characteristic themes: \u201chis curiosity,\u201d as Gerald DeWitt Sanders and his fellow editors put it in Chief Modern Poets of Britain and America, \u201cabout what lies behind the social mask of character, and \u2026 his dark hints about sexuality, loyalty, and man\u2019s terrible will to defeat himself.\u201d\n\r\nTilbury Town is first mentioned in \u201cJohn Evereldown,\u201d a ballad collected in The Torrent and The Night Before. John Evereldown, out late at night, is called back to the house by his wife, who is wondering why he wants to walk the long cold miles into town. He responds, \u201cGod knows if I pray to be done with it all/But God\u2019s no friend of John Evereldown./So the clouds may come and the rain may fall,/the shadows may creep and the dead men crawl,\u2014/But I follow the women wherever they call,/And that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to Tilbury Town.\u201d\n\r\nTilbury Town reappears at intervals throughout Robinson\u2019s work. The title poem in Captain Craig concerns an old resident of the town whose life, believed wasted by his neighbors, proves to have been of value. The Children of the Night contains the story of Richard Cory, \u201ca gentleman from sole to crown,/Clean favored, and imperially slim,\u201d who \u201cone calm summer night,/Went home and put a bullet through his head,\u201d and Tilbury Town itself is personified in the lines \u201cIn fine, we thought that he was everything/ To make us wish that we were in his place.\u201d The Man against the Sky\u2014according to Gilbert, Robinson\u2019s \u201cmost important single volume,\u201d and probably his most critically acclaimed\u2014includes the story of the man \u201cFlammonde,\u201d one of the poet\u2019s most anthologized Tilbury verses.\n\r\nDespite the fact that much of Robinson\u2019s verse dealt with failed lives, several critics see his work as life-affirming. May Sinclair, writing an early review of Captain Craig for the Fortnightly Review, said of the Captain, \u201cHe, ragged, old, and starved, challenges his friends to have courage and to rejoice in the sun.\u201d Amy Lowell, in her Tendencies in Modern American Poetry, stated, \u201cI have spoken of Mr. Robinson\u2019s \u2018unconscious cynicism.\u2019 It is unconscious because he never dwells upon it as such, never delights in it, nor wraps it comfortably about him. It is hardly more than the reverse of the shield of pain, and in his later work, it gives place to a great, pitying tenderness. \u2018Success through Failure,\u2019 that is the motto on the other side of his banner of \u2018Courage.\u2019\u201d And Robert Frost, in his introduction to Robinson\u2019s King Jasper, declared, \u201cHis theme was unhappiness itself, but his skill was as happy as it was playful. There is that comforting thought for those who suffered to see him suffer.\u201d\n\r\nMany Tilbury Town verses were among the poems Robinson included in his Pulitzer Prize-winning Collected Poems of 1922. He won his second poetry Pulitzer in 1924, this time for The Man Who Died Twice, the story of a street musician whose one musical masterpiece is lost when he collapses after a night of debauchery. Gilbert attributed the poem\u2019s success to its \u201ccombination of down-to-earth diction, classical allusion, and understated humor.\u201d In 1927, Robinson again won a Pulitzer for his long narrative poem Tristram, one in a series of poems based on Arthurian legends. Tristram proved to be Robinson\u2019s only true popular success\u2014it was that rarity of 20th-century literature, a best-selling book-length poem\u2014and it received critical acclaim as well. \u201cIt may be said not only that \u2018Tristram\u2019 is the finest of Mr. Robinson\u2019s narrative poems,\u201d wrote Lloyd Morris in the Nation, \u201cbut that it is among the very few fine modern narrative poems in English.\u201d\n\r\nEarly in 1935, Robinson fell ill with cancer. He stayed hospitalized until his death, correcting galley proofs of his last poem, King Jasper, only hours before slipping into a final coma. \u201cMagazines and newspapers throughout the country took elaborate notice of Robinson\u2019s death,\u201d declared Gilbert, \u201creminding their readers that he had been considered America\u2019s foremost poet for nearly 20 years and praising his industry, integrity, and devotion to his art.\u201d\n\u201cIt may come to the notice of our posterity (and then again it may not),\u201d wrote Robert Frost in his introduction to King Jasper, \u201cthat this, our age, ran wild in the quest of new ways to be new. \u2026 Robinson stayed content with the old-fashioned ways to be new. \u2026 Robinson has gone to his place in American literature and left his human place among us vacant,\u201d Frost concluded. \u201cWe mourn, but with the qualification that, after all, his life was a revel in the felicities of language.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
