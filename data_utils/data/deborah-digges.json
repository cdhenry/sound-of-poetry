The sixth of 10 children, Digges grew up accompanying her oncologist father on his rounds, as well as visiting a women\u2019s prison where her mother taught religion. Her poetry often recounts episodes from her childhood, as well as her experiences as a young wife and mother.\nAccording to James Naiden, who wrote a long piece exploring Digges\u2019s work in Rain Taxi, \u201cDigges is a wanderer in her past, and in those of her many siblings\u2014\u2018Four brothers. Six sisters.\u2019\u2014and from this draws much material for poems.\u201d But Digges\u2019s poetry is also concerned with the natural world; in her careful lyrics, finely wrought metaphors trace the experience of perception and understanding one\u2019s place in a world of animal and vegetable life. For David Gewanter, Digges \u201cnames the heart of an extinguished world, sounding out with hard measures the many presences of her life: an absent-lover-turned-tyrant, boys losing their childish ways, a father suffering his last labor and animals turned into hand shadows.\u201d Digges\u2019s collections of poetry include the posthumous The Wind Blows through the Doors of my Heart (2010); Trapeze (2004), which includes elegies for her third husband, Franklin Loew; Rough Music (1995), winner of the prestigious Kingsley Tufts Award; Late in the Millenium (1989); and Vesper Sparrows (1986), which won the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Prize for a best first book of poetry.\nIn addition to poetry, Digges published two well-received memoirs. In Fugitive Spring: Coming of Age in the \u201950s and \u201960s (1992), she chronicles her childhood growing up in Missouri, describing her frustration with the gender roles of the day and detailing how she found freedom in the 1960s when she was able to develop her own identity. According to the Chicago Tribune, Digges \u201cproduces tones, shades and images that are precise, crisp, and evocative.\u201d Digges\u2019s second memoir, The Stardust Lounge: Stories from a Boy\u2019s Adolescence (2001) is a portrait of her younger son, Stephen, called \u201ca hell-raiser of mythic proportions\u201d by Emily Fox Gordon in the New York Times. Stephen, a frustrated, gifted, and alienated teen, shook Digges\u2019s complacency and filled her with questions. That questioning spirit pervades Digges\u2019s work in both poetry and memoir. In the New Yorker, John Michaud noted his feeling after reading a poem by Digges: \u201cI was discovering something new, but that the discovery was somehow illicit, that I was looking into someone else\u2019s private thoughts.\u201d Michaud added, \u201cShe was the kind of writer whose work went deep into the lives of her readers.\u201d\nDigges earned degrees from the University of California, Riverside, the University of Missouri, and the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. She received many honors and awards for her work, including fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Ingram Merrill Foundation. A long-time professor at Tufts University, Digges died in 2009 in Amherst, Massachusetts at age 59. Friends, students, and colleagues remembered Digges in an outpouring of memorials and tributes. Tufts president Lawrence Bacow said Digges\u2019s death was not only \u201ca great loss for American poetry, but it is an especially painful loss for the Tufts community where we knew her not only as one of the outstanding creative visionaries in American poetry, but also as an inspiring teacher, a generous mentor, and a cherished friend.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
