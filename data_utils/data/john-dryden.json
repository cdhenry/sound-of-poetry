After\u00a0William Shakespeare\u00a0and\u00a0Ben Jonson, he was the greatest playwright. And he has no peer as a writer of prose, especially literary criticism, and as a translator. Other figures, such as\u00a0George Herbert\u00a0or\u00a0Andrew Marvell\u00a0or William Wycherley or William Congreve, may figure more prominently in anthologies and literary histories, but Dryden\u2019s sustained output in both poetry and drama ranks him higher. After Shakespeare, he wrote the greatest heroic play of the century,\u00a0The Conquest of Granada\u00a0(1670, 1671), and the greatest tragicomedy,\u00a0Marriage A-la-Mode\u00a0\u00a0(1671). He wrote the greatest tragedy of the Restoration,\u00a0All for Love\u00a0(1677), the greatest tragicomedy,\u00a0Don Sebastian\u00a0(1689), and one of the greatest comedies,\u00a0Amphitryon\u00a0(1690). As a writer of prose he developed a lucid professional style, relying on patterns and rhythms of everyday speech. As a critic he developed a combination of methods\u2014historical, analytical, evaluative, dialogic\u2014that helped grow the neoclassical theory of literary criticism. As a translator he developed an easy manner of what he called paraphrase that produced brilliant versions of Homer, Lucretius, Horace, Ovid, Juvenal, Persius, Giovanni Boccaccio,\u00a0Geoffrey Chaucer, and above all Virgil. His translation of The Aeneid remains the best ever produced in English. As a poet he perfected the heroic couplet, sprinkling it with judicious enjambments, triplets, and metric variations and bequeathing it to\u00a0Alexander Pope\u00a0to work upon it his own magic.\n\r\nDryden the poet is best known today as a satirist, although he wrote only two great original satires: Mac Flecknoe\u00a0(1682) and\u00a0The Medall\u00a0(1682). His most famous poem,\u00a0Absalom and Achitophel\u00a0(1681) contains several brilliant satiric portraits. But unlike satire, it comes to a final, tragic resolution. Dryden\u2019s other great poems\u2014Annus Mirabilis\u00a0(1667),\u00a0Religio Laici\u00a0(1682),\u00a0The Hind and the Panther\u00a0(1687),\u00a0Anne Killigrew\u00a0(1686),\u00a0Alexander\u2019s Feast\u00a0(1697), and \u201cTo My Honour\u2019d Kinsman\u201d (1700)\u2014are not satires either. And he contributed a wonderful body of occasional poems:\u00a0panegyrics,\u00a0odes,\u00a0elegies, prologues, and epilogues.\nDryden was born\u00a0 August 9, 1631 into an extended family of rising Puritan gentry in Northamptonshire. But as a teenager he was sent to the King\u2019s School at Westminster to be trained as a King\u2019s Scholar by the brilliant Royalist headmaster Richard Busby. Dryden\u2019s family sided with the Commonwealth; however, in his first published poem, the elegy \u201cUpon the Death of the Lord Hastings\"\u2014included in a volume (1649) of verses upon this young aristocrat\u2019s untimely death from smallpox\u2014Dryden revealed Royalist sympathies.\n\r\nPerhaps because of family pressure, Dryden largely avoiding publishing again until he had left Cambridge, where he was an undergraduate at Trinity College, and had been in the employ of Oliver Cromwell\u2019s government, probably in the Office of Latin Secretary along with Milton and Marvell. This is perhaps the first evidence of Dryden\u2019s trimming his sails to the political winds, as centuries of critics have accused him. His cousin, the prominent Puritan Sir Gilbert Pickering, lord chamberlain to Cromwell, probably procured employment for Dryden, and when the Protector died in 1659, Dryden, perhaps out of a sense of duty either internally or externally imposed, published his \u201cHeroique Stanzas, Consecrated to the Glorious Memory \u2026\u201d of Cromwell. People\u2014especially young people\u2014change their opinions all the time, so we should feel no compulsion to make Dryden consistent. But this poem is filled with so many perplexing ambiguities, as especially Steven N. Zwicker has noted, that no coherent republican ideology emerges from it.\n\r\nIn \u201cHeroique Stanzas\u201d Dryden\u2019s ambivalence is expressed in the halting use of the quatrain made fashionable in Sir William Davenant\u2019s\u00a0Gondibert\u00a0(1651). In contrast, the assuredness of his heroic couplets in\u00a0Astraea Redux\u00a0(1660), his poem celebrating Charles Stuart\u2019s restoration, may perhaps indicate Dryden\u2019s comfort with a feudal monarchist rather than a bourgeois republican ideological myth. Moreover, the first 28 lines of\u00a0Astraea Redux\u00a0can be read as seven quatrains made up of couplets rather than alternating rhymes\u2014as if to show Dryden could write sophisticated quatrains his own way:\nWe sigh\u2019d to hear the fair Iberian Bride\r\nMust grow a Lilie to the Lilies side,\r\nWhile Our cross Stars deny\u2019d us Charles his Bed\r\nWhom Our first Flames and Virgin Love did wed.\r\nFor his long absence Church and State did groan;\r\nMadness the Pulpit, Faction seiz\u2019d the Throne:\r\nExperienc\u2019d Age in deep despair was lost\r\nTo see the Rebel thrive, the Loyal crost.\nThe image of the monarch as lover and his land as either loyal or disloyal spouse are integral to Dryden\u2019s ideological myth throughout the rest of his career. Central to this myth is the ultimate theodicean problem/solution: if power is the essence of government, then God himself can be stormed and \u201cviolated\u201d; that is, there is no metaphysical guarantee to enforce the bonds of fidelity between leaders and people. For Dryden, normally absent Astraea (Justice) does return. In this poem \u201cProvidence\u201d rules not by sheer power but by law and thus ensures that Charles\u2019s \u201cright\u201d is ultimately upheld, that he cannot be \u201cGods Anointed\u201d in vain.\n\r\nIn many ways\u00a0Astraea Redux\u00a0anticipates foundational tropes in Dryden\u2019s later, greater political poems: the iron law of oligarchy that belies rebellion\u2019s rhetoric; the analogy between King Charles and King David; the analogy between the Puritans\u2019 Solemn League and Covenant in Charles\u2019s England and the Catholics\u2019 Holy League in Henri IV\u2019s France; the hypocrisy of glozing the \u201csin\u201d of rebellion with the name of \u201cReligion\u201d; the counseling of mercy over justice; and, finally, exhortation of the king to concentrate on England\u2019s navy and its trade. What little positive Dryden saw in Cromwell\u2014his contribution to British imperialism\u2014can now be extended exponentially:\nOur Nation with united Int\u2019rest blest\r\nNot now content to poize, shall sway the rest.\r\nAbroad your Empire shall no Limits know,\r\nBut like the Sea in boundless Circles flow.\nDryden identifies civilization itself, as opposed to a primitive \u201clawless salvage Libertie,\u201d with the \u201cArts\u201d of \u201cEmpire\u201d from Rome to contemporary England, an empire that is at once patriarchal, hierarchal, monarchal, and commercial.\n\r\nIn between the poems celebrating Cromwell and Charles, Dryden appears to have moved toward his career as a professional writer, his deceased father not having left him a sufficient income to survive where Dryden wanted to live\u2014in the hub of political and cultural activity, London. In the late 1650s he seems to have lived with and written prefaces for the bookseller Henry Herringman, and by the early 1660s he had moved into lodgings with Sir Robert Howard, a younger son of Thomas Howard, first Earl of Berkshire, with impeccable Royalist credentials and a budding literary career. In a system of symbiosis between patrons and poets, Dryden had found himself a patron, and Howard had found himself an editor and collaborator. Dryden helped prepare Howard\u2019s first volume of poems for the press in 1660, for which he wrote the first of many panegyrics to prominent individuals, \u201cTo My Honored Friend, Sir Robert Howard,\u201d and in 1664 they collaborated on\u00a0The Indian-Queen, a drama that contributed significantly to the Restoration fashion of rhymed heroic play (influenced, among other things, by those the exiled court witnessed in France) and that introduced what was to be the staple of Dryden\u2019s later contributions, the noble savage, whose powerful energy is eventually socialized.\n\r\nDryden\u2019s relationship with Howard is important in other ways: Dryden married his sister Lady Elizabeth Howard in 1663. Why a member of so prestigious a family would have stooped to a member of the lesser gentry remains a subject for speculation. But the match was certainly advantageous for Dryden, who was now a member of the powerful Howard family, several members of which aside from Sir Robert were playwrights. Along with his brothers-in-law Dryden tried his hand at his own plays. His first, a comedy entitled\u00a0The Wild Gallant\u00a0(1663), despite being a failure, won the support of another influential aristocrat, Barbara Villiers Palmer, Countess of Castelmaine, to whom Dryden addressed another verse epistle. Indeed, with such encouragement, abetted by his collaboration with Sir Robert (who had become a shareholder in the new Theatre Royal in Bridges Street), Dryden became a stable writer for the King\u2019s Company under Sir Thomas Killigrew and began to succeed on his own with his first tragicomedy,\u00a0The Rival Ladies\u00a0(late 1663?), and with a sequel to\u00a0The Indian-Queen, The Indian Emperour\u00a0(early 1665).\n\r\nDryden wrote three other panegyrics during the early 1660s:\u00a0To His Sacred Majesty, A Panegyrick On His Coronation\u00a0(1661),\u00a0To My Lord Chancellor\u00a0(1662), and \u201cTo My Honour\u2019d Friend, Dr Charleton\u201d (1663). In them he perfected the witty compliment begun with the poem to Sir Robert. But he also perfected the device of giving advice under cover of compliment, for example reminding the rakish Charles in the Coronation poem that political stability depends on his choosing a bride with all deliberate speed in order to ensure the succession. And the Charleton poem reflects Dryden\u2019s interest in the new science, an interest rewarded by invitation in the early 1660s to become a member of the Royal Academy of Science, although he appears not to have participated and was subsequently dropped.\n\r\nIn 1665 the plague was so bad in London that Dryden had to rusticate himself and his wife at her family estate in Charlton, Wiltshire. There he wrote three excellent works:\u00a0Of Dramatick Poesie: An Essay\u00a0(1667), the first great sustained work in English dramatic theory;\u00a0Secret-Love\u00a0(1667), a tragicomedy; and\u00a0Annus Mirabilis: The Year of Wonders, 1666\u00a0(1667). This \u201cHistorical Poem\u201d celebrating English victories at sea during the Second Dutch War and Charles II\u2019s conduct during the Great Fire of London won Dryden the poet laureateship in 1668.\n\r\nBecause it was published in 1667, Dryden\u2019s heroic poem invites comparison with Milton\u2019s great epic Paradise Lost, first published in its ten-book format that same year.\u00a0\u00a0Milton\u2019s epic\u2014written by this radical Puritan secretary to Cromwell\u2014looks back through its aristocratic mode to classical and medieval times. Dryden\u2019s poem, despite its aristocratic elements of monarchism and heroic valor, its classical allusions and epic similes, looks forward through its bourgeois celebration of mercantile expansion, maritime dominance, and homely imagery of laboring citizens to the rule of a capitalist Britannia under a constitutional monarch.\n\r\nMichael McKeon has brilliantly demonstrated that the poem is essentially political propaganda designed to stifle domestic dissent by rallying the nation around the common causes of war abroad and disaster at home. Dryden mythologizes Charles II, his brother James, Duke of York, and the triumphant admirals and generals as classical and Christian heroes and even gods. The care of the king is portrayed as being analogous to divine providence. This mythologizing seems deployed especially to defuse opposition to Charles and thereby to avert the potential unraveling of the Restoration compromise. Thus Charles is portrayed as the bride of his loyal country, or, even more explicitly, of the loyal City of London, and Dryden\u2014from his Dedication to the City through his portrayal of the restored ship Loyal London to the restoration of the city itself as a \u201cMaiden Queen\u201d of commerce\u2014exhorts almost desperately a fidelity on the part of the emergent bourgeoisie.\n\r\nUnderneath the mythologizing, Dryden is attempting to placate the growing power of the city as the center of trade and finance by getting it to view the real challenge for England as the battle over who controls world trade. Only one nation, one navy can and should control it (\u201cWhat peace can be where both to one pretend?\u201d). Therefore, the logic of the poem goes, Britain should defeat Holland, eclipse the trade of the rest of Europe, and make the world\u2019s waters a \u201cBritish Ocean.\u201d Thus British \u201cCommerce\u201d will make \u201cone City of the Universe.\u201d But this universal city will not mark the end of competition in some sort of utopian distribution of the cornucopia. Dryden\u2019s model is one of acquisitive proto-capitalism: \u201csome may gain, and all may be suppli\u2019d.\u201d Then as now such a trickle-down theory results in the \u201csome\u201d gaining a disproportionate amount of the world\u2019s wealth at the expense and exploitation of the many. Behind Dryden\u2019s cornucopia lies an imperialist theory of dominance.\n\r\nNevertheless, at his very best Dryden the mythologizer of late feudalism and incipient capitalism descends occasionally from his highly allusive and allegorical mode to portray real people in material situations, as in these stanzas:\nNight came, but without darkness or repose,\r\nA dismal picture of the gen\u2019ral doom:\r\nWhere Souls distracted when the Trumpet blows,\r\nAnd half unready with their bodies come.\r\nThose who have homes, when home they do repair\r\nTo a last lodging call their wand\u2019ring friends.\r\nTheir short uneasie sleeps are broke with care,\r\nTo look how near their own destruction tends.\r\nThose who have none sit round where once it was,\r\nAnd with full eyes each wonted room require:\r\nHaunting the yet warm ashes of the place,\r\nAs murder\u2019d men walk where they did expire.\nThe opening allegorical yet human image is worthy of Donne. For anyone who has lived through fire, hurricane, or tornado, the stanzas painting the near or already homeless are quite poignant. And Dryden\u2019s maturity as a poet is evidenced here by his masterful handling of not only image but sound: the reversed iambs and spondees, the frequent alliteration and occasional assonance (\u201cSouls \u2026 blows\u201d), and especially the freeze-frame quality of successive emphasized syllables imitating the eyes\u2019 movement from room to room around the absent house.\n\r\nDryden dares most by his inclusion, in these new heroic stanzas, of indecorously technical and vulgar terms for material work by the laboring force of shipbuilders called upon to repair the British fleet, from picking \u201cbullets\u201d out of planks, to caulking seams with \u201cOkum\u201d and \u201cboiling Pitch.\u201d Dryden is no democrat; he has no love here as elsewhere in his poetry for \u201cth\u2019ignoble crowd,\u201d and he hints at the anarchy unleashed by republican rebels. However, in his image of these industrious laborers demonstrating their loyalty and contributing to the cause, he raises them to the stature of the heroic. In the same poem in which he mythologizes the duke of York and Prince Rupert and George Monck, Duke of Albemarle, and King Charles himself, the reader experiences the following realistic snapshots: Albemarle, his breeches ignominiously blown off; and while the King harmlessly amuses himself playing with the \u201cnew-cast Canons,\u201d among the shipworkers. \u201cTo try new shrouds one mounts into the wind, / And one, below, their ease or stifness notes.\u201d By diminishing heroes and exalting workers Dryden has at least leveled them into a common humanity, united in a bourgeois image of cooperation between government, venture capital, and guild labor in order to subdue the earth.\n\r\nDryden\u2019s return to London in the winter of 1666-1667 was triumphant. Several of his plays were staged, new and old; the Essay was published; the King\u2019s Company signed Dryden to a contract in which he became a shareholder and agreed to give them three new plays per year; and he received the laureateship\u2014all before the end of 1668. By the end of 1671 he had produced four more plays, including two masterpieces,\u00a0The Conquest of Granada, a rhymed heroic play in ten acts, and\u00a0Marriage A-la-Mode, a split-plot tragicomedy. Dryden had established himself as the greatest dramatist of his time. And if one can separate out his development as a poet per se\u2014a difficult task when his plays have so much verse, so many songs, and prologues and epilogues in couplets\u2014one would have to conclude that, despite the absence during these years of isolated poems, Dryden achieved a virtuosity of verse and wit unequaled during the Restoration. Palmyra\u2019s description of her falling in love with Leonidas in\u00a0Marriage A-la-Mode\u00a0is lovelily lyrical. The prologue to\u00a0An Evening\u2019s Love\u00a0(1668) concerning poets as worn-out gallants and the songs concerning wet dreams and worn-out marriage vows from\u00a0The Conquest of Granada and Marriage A-la-Mode respectively are wickedly witty and wonderfully versified. But Dryden\u2019s most impressive work is probably his puckish epilogue to\u00a0Tyrannic Love\u00a0(1669), spoken by Nell Gwyn, outrageously rakish actress and mistress to Charles II (among others). Having played Valeria, daughter of the Roman emperor Maximin who martyrs Saint Catharine, and having herself been a martyr to love, Nell is about to be carried off at the end of the play, when she leaps up\u2014most certainly to the audience\u2019s delight in such comic relief\u2014and speaks the epilogue in couplets that rival Alexander Pope\u2019s for their colloquial and dramatically conversational style:\nTo the Bearer. Hold, are you mad? you damn\u2019d confounded Dog,\r\nI am to rise, and speak the Epilogue.\r\nTo the Audience. I come, kind Gentlemen, strange news to tell ye,\r\nI am the Ghost of poor departed Nelly\u2026.\r\nO Poet, damn\u2019d dull Poet, who could prove\r\nSo sensless! to make Nelly die for Love;\r\nNay, what\u2019s yet worse, to kill me in the prime\r\nOf Easter-Term, in Tart and Cheese-cake time!\r\nI\u2019le fit the Fopp; for I\u2019le not one word say\r\nT\u2019excuse his godly out-of-fashion Play:\r\nA Play which if you dare but twice sit out,\r\nYou\u2019l all be slander\u2019d, and be thought devout.\r\nBut farewel, Gentlemen, make haste to me,\r\nI\u2019m sure e\u2019re long to have your company.\r\nAs for my Epitaph when I am gone,\r\nI\u2019le trust no Poet, but will write my own.\r\nHere Nelly lies, who, though she liv\u2019d a Slater\u2019n,\r\nYet dy\u2019d a Princess, acting in S. Cathar\u2019n.\nThe laughter must have brought down the house. Yet 20th-century critics do not seem to understand that such wit does not undercut the seriousness of such plays as\u00a0Tyrannic Love,\u00a0The Conquest of Granada, and\u00a0Marriage A-la-Mode. Urbanity does not mean a supercilious, ironic rejection of all values but rather a witty reflexivity and studied insouciance about them.\n\r\nBy 1672, then, Dryden was at the height of his powers and reputation. He had added to the title poet laureate that of historiographer royal. He hobnobbed with the powerful and, despite his increasing family (by then, three sons), appears to have aped the manners of his betters by fashionably taking a mistress, the actress Ann Reeves. But the first hints of the tarnishing of his triumph had also appeared: his feud with his brother-in-law Sir Robert over the aesthetic merit of rhyme in drama escalated through Dryden\u2019s Essay to Howard\u2019s preface to\u00a0The Great Favourite; or, The Duke of Lerma\u00a0(1668) to Dryden\u2019s extremely intemperate \u201cDefence\u201d of the Essay, prefixed to the second edition of\u00a0The Indian Emperour\u00a0in the same year. Because this preface was removed from most copies of this edition, one can speculate that Dryden realized his error in judgment, but his relationship with his brother-in-law may have been permanently damaged. A few years later, perhaps out of pique at Dryden\u2019s pride in his success, George Villiers, second Duke of Buckingham, attacked Dryden as a poetaster in\u00a0The Rehearsal\u00a0(1671). The era of Dryden\u2019s public brawls with his critics had begun.\n\r\nThings got worse when fire destroyed Dryden\u2019s company\u2019s theater at the inopportune time of the rival company\u2019s moving into an extravagant new theater in Dorset Garden. Furthermore, the Duke\u2019s Company was beginning to have the best actors as Thomas Betterton gathered great young talent around him, and it was beginning to attract new and successful playwrights: Thomas Shadwell, Edward Ravenscroft, and Elkanah Settle. Dryden\u2019s own new comedy,\u00a0The Assignation\u00a0(1672), failed, and even his jingoistic propaganda attack against the Dutch during the outbreak of the Third Dutch War,\u00a0Amboyna\u00a0(1673), did not salvage the fortunes of the King\u2019s Company. When their new theater in Drury Lane opened in 1674, Dryden, in an attempt to rival the extravaganzas of the Duke\u2019s Company, tried to turn his great admiration for Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost to account by creating an operatic version, The State of Innocence. He appears even to have gone so far as to visit the aged and blind poet, with whom he had once worked, in order to ask his permission. From all his references to Milton\u2019s great poems throughout his works, beginning perhaps as early as 1669, one can infer in what respect Dryden held Milton, but unfortunately nothing is known of this meeting. Even more unfortunately, for Dryden and the King\u2019s Company at least, the company could not afford to produce the opera, and it was never performed. At this nadir of his career, Dryden sought an appointment at Oxford where he could retire from the stage and write his own epic poem. Neither desire was realized.\n\r\nWhether caused by Milton\u2019s great aesthetic achievements and his attack on rhymed plays, or by Settle\u2019s embarrassingly bathetic popular successes in Dryden\u2019s erstwhile favorite genre of rhymed heroic play, or just by Dryden\u2019s own study (perhaps of plays by the great French dramatist Jean Racine), Dryden began his comeback by moving toward a more neoclassical form of drama. In\u00a0Notes and Observations on the Empress of Morocco\u00a0(1674), he joined in an attack on Settle\u2019s extravagance. In 1675, although he gave the King\u2019s Company another excellent rhymed heroic play, Aureng-Zebe, in the prologue he bade farewell to his \u201clong-lov\u2019d Mistris, Rhyme\u201d (and probably his other mistress, Ann Reeves, as well) as he began to imitate Racine. His next three serious plays were blank-verse, neoclassical tragedies, and one\u2014All for Love\u00a0(1677)\u2014was the greatest tragedy of the Restoration; indeed, it remains the greatest tragedy in English after Shakespeare, and it is still performed in England. His theory of the late 1670s (\"Heads of an Answer to Rymer,\u201d \u201cThe Grounds of Criticism in Tragedy\"), influenced by Thomas Rymer and the French critics, as well as by Racine, became more neoclassical. And he turned his attention to the translation of classics. Dryden began severing ties with the King\u2019s Company had begun as early as 1677, when he insisted on the third night\u2019s profits from\u00a0All for Love. It continued with the Duke\u2019s Company\u2019s production of\u00a0The Kind Keeper\u00a0in 1678 (apparently because the King\u2019s Company did not want it).\n\r\nBut before Dryden made the transition from King\u2019s to Duke\u2019s, from romance to neoclassical tragedy, from depression to renewed vigor as dramatist, he had some scores to settle. When his fortunes were sinking, he had appealed to\u00a0John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, to patronize him, but, after some initial flirtation, Rochester proved inconstant, supported Dryden\u2019s rival Shadwell instead, and lampooned Dryden in \u201cAn Allusion to Horace.\u201d Dryden had been feuding with Shadwell over the theory of comedy for years in various prefaces and dedications, but the two had remained relatively conciliatory and had collaborated with John Crowne in the attack on Settle. In early 1676, however, the same year Rochester\u2019s satire was circulating in manuscript, Shadwell broke the facade of civility and lampooned Dryden as well throughout his comedy\u00a0The Virtuoso.\nDryden responded with a vengeance probably doubled by displaced anger at Rochester and compounded by his own poor fortunes, both literal and figurative, in the first half of the decade. Beginning most likely in the summer of 1676, Dryden wrote one of the two greatest satires in English against rival poets, Mac Flecknoe (the other is Pope\u2019s Dunciad, 1728\u20141743). He certainly had finished it by 1678, though it circulated in manuscript until unauthorized publication in 1682. The controlling fiction of the poem is succession, a daring motif in a country where the restored monarch had produced no legitimate male heir. Witness the brashness of the opening lines:\nAll humane things are subject to decay,\r\nAnd, when Fate summons, Monarchs must obey[.]\nThe phenomenology of the first reading dictates that the reader\u2019s expectations for a heavy, topical political poem have been aroused. The next couplet provides a crashing diminuendo:\nThis Fleckno found, who, like Augustus, young\r\nWas call\u2019d to Empire, and had govern\u2019d long.\nThe poem is a mock panegyric, a paradoxical encomium, complete with parodic procession and coronation. Dryden the poet laureate destroys his rival by crowning him anti\u2014poet laureate, king of \u201cthe Realms of Non-sense\u201d: \u201cfrom Ireland let him reign / To farr Barbadoes on the Western main\u201d\u2014that is, he reigns over the unpopulated Atlantic Ocean! By making Richard Flecknoe his poetic forebear, Dryden denies Shadwell the lineage he has claimed, to be a new Son of Ben (Jonson) because of his dedication to a comedy of humors. Instead, Flecknoe was a poetaster who paid to have his plays published, who sometimes changed a title and added a little window dressing to get one produced (Erminia\u00a0[1661] to\u00a0Emilia\u00a0[1672]), whose plays, whether produced or not were uniformly bad. To make Shadwell Flecknoe\u2019s heir was to put down another upstart, especially by portraying him as impotent, capable of producing urine and feces and freaks but no legitimate, manly poetic progeny.\n\r\nThroughout the poem Dryden combines references to dirt with references to myth. The latter does not \u201ctranscend\u201d the former (another favorite metaphor of critics) but coexists with it, cocreates the joke, which is intended to amuse Dryden\u2019s friends, antagonize his enemies, and hurt Shadwell himself. Curiously, the Dryden who seems so preoccupied in his prologues and epilogues with establishing a bourgeois community of taste that contemns \u201clow\u201d artistic techniques and types such as slapstick and farce reveals himself to be the master of Rabelaisian humor. In the cruelest cut of all, he has Flecknoe say to Sh____ (Shadwell), \u201cWith whate\u2019er gall thou sett\u2019st thy self to write, / Thy inoffensive Satyrs never bite.\u201d Dryden\u2019s satire has bitten so well that he has effectively decapitated Shadwell for three centuries, precisely because he has so masterfully combined high and low. Playing a mock\u2014John the Baptist to Shadwell\u2019s mock-Messiah, Flecknoe prepares the way for a mock\u2014Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem-London, where not palm leaves\nBut scatter\u2019d Limbs of mangled Poets lay:\r\nFrom dusty shops neglected Authors come,\r\nMartyrs of Pies, and Reliques of the Bum.\nThis mixing of sacred and scatological is positively medieval in its folk humor. Dryden can pretend that Shadwell has debased Jonson into selling \u201cBargains, Whip-stitch, kiss my Arse,\u201d but this last phrase is exactly what Dryden has commanded Sh____\u00a0to do.\n\r\nAfter the success of\u00a0All for Love\u00a0and the growing chances for his security with the Duke\u2019s Company, Dryden must have felt emboldened enough to settle his other score by attacking Rochester himself in his preface to the published version of the new play in early 1678. Squire Dryden asserts his talents as a literary professional to be superior to those of the court wits, who properly ought to confine their literary dabbling to being good patrons. Perhaps Dryden was feeling protected by his new patron, the dedicatee of\u00a0All for Love, Lord Treasurer Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby. Indeed, shortly after Danby\u2019s fall from power in 1679, Dryden was attacked by thugs in Rose Alley and beaten soundly. Did Rochester and his friends finally take their revenge? Or by that time had Dryden offended someone else (suggestions have included the King\u2019s mistress, Louise de K\u00e9roualle, Duchess of Portsmouth, and the Whig Opposition)? The point of the beating is that Dryden was considered uppity enough for some group to want to teach him a lesson. But if they thought they would intimidate him, they were mistaken.\n\r\nIn 1678 occurred the infamous Popish Plot. Several witnesses, most notorious among them Titus Oates, offered perjured testimony to the effect that the Jesuits were planning the overthrow of the government and a return of England to the yoke of Catholicism\u2014a threat that Englishmen, in the light of characters in their history since the time of Henry VIII, from Bloody Mary to Guy Fawkes, found credible. (Indeed, they were right to be suspicious, for the Stuarts had made an unholy alliance with France eventually to deliver their nation back into the Catholic fold.) Several Catholic heads rolled; Catholic peers were removed from the House of Lords; the duke of York and his new Catholic duchess, Maria Beatrice, had to go into exile; and a new Parliament was elected, one that was ready to pass legislation to exclude James from the throne because of his religion: thus the name given to this political turmoil, the Exclusion Crisis. Some of the principals tried to get Charles to declare his bastard son, James Scott, Duke of Monmouth, his legitimate heir. Several playwrights jumped on the anti-Catholic bandwagon as if to say, \u201cwe might disagree with the exclusionists, but we are not therefore in favor of a foreign-based Catholic takeover, ultimately by Rome through France.\u201d Dryden himself grabbed onto the wagon in his next play,\u00a0The Spanish Fryar\u00a0(1680), in which he satirizes a priest; nevertheless, in the high plot he strenuously upholds the principle of hereditary, patrilineal monarchal succession. He apparently (his authorship is disputed) even more stridently defended Charles\u2019s dissolution of Parliament in a pamphlet entitled His Majesties Declaration Defended\u00a0 (1681). And finally he wrote one of the great political poems in the English language,\u00a0Absalom and Achitophel\u00a0(1681).\n\r\nDryden uses the familiar trope of superimposing scriptural story over current events. He had already availed himself of the David story in Astraea Redux. The consequences for propaganda are obvious. Dryden endows his vision of events with sacred authority: the social and the sacred Logos are the same. Thus a theoretical dispute over the mode of political succession gets mythologized and mystified. Parliament\u2019s struggle to control succession becomes a blasphemous, ultimately Satanic revolt against \u201cheavens Anointing Oyle.\u201d Absalom\u2019s sacrilegious revolt against David gets reenacted in contemporary history. The evil counselor Achitophel becomes Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury, one of the leaders of the Parliamentary party, who was caricatured repeatedly in ways reminiscent of Shakespeare\u2019s treatment of Richard III. Dryden adds the further fillip of overlaying Miltonian pattern: Achitophel/Shaftesbury becomes Satan tempting an anti-Messiah to be the people\u2019s \u201cSaviour.\u201d\n\r\nOne of the problems with the biblical parallel is that its arc is tragic. It is as if Dryden wrote Monmouth into a text from which he could not escape. David threatens at the end, \u201cIf my Young Samson will pretend a Call / To shake the Column, let him share the Fall.\u201d David\u2019s urge, on the other hand, is to be lenient. But Monmouth never did heed the poet\u2019s advice; he led a revolt upon his father\u2019s death in 1685 and was executed. Moreover, as with the biblical David, Dryden\u2019s David/Charles is trammeled up in the consequences of his adultery. Dryden opens again brilliantly:\nIn pious times, e\u2019er Priest-craft did begin,\r\nBefore Polygamy was made a sin;\r\nWhen man, on many, multiply\u2019d his kind,\r\nE\u2019r one to one was, cursedly, confind:\r\nWhen Nature prompted, and no law deny\u2019d\r\nPromiscuous use of Concubine and Bride;\r\nThen, Israel\u2019s Monarch, after Heaven\u2019s own heart,\r\nHis vigorous warmth did, variously, impart\r\nTo Wives and Slaves: And, wide as his Command,\r\nScatter\u2019d his Maker\u2019s Image through the Land.\nHowever wittily Dryden opens the poem, the ultimate point of its portrayal of David\u2019s promiscuity is that \u201cNo True Succession\u201d can \u201cattend\u201d the \u201cseed\u201d of David\u2019s concubines. Another of Dryden\u2019s bold openings has cut to the heart of the matter. When Absalom and David both later complain that Absalom was born too high but not high enough, they may blame \u201cFate\u201d or \u201cGod,\u201d but the fault is clearly David\u2019s own.\n\r\nHowever, the point of Dryden\u2019s poem is neither to recuperate Monmouth nor admonish Charles. It is to discredit thoroughly Charles\u2019s enemies and their putative political theory, praise his steadfast friends, and vindicate Charles himself. The first objective Dryden accomplishes with perhaps the most devastating rogues\u2019 gallery of satiric portraits ever assembled. The portraits are not devastating solely because of vitriolic lampooning, though there is plenty of that. They are devastating because they at first appear evenhanded, a studied moderation designed to appeal to the common sense of Dryden\u2019s contemporary audience. Dryden\u2019s portrait of Absalom, for example, appears balanced. He is like one of Dryden\u2019s noble savages. But the difference is that he does not turn out to be the legitimate heir, and he knows it, acknowledging David\u2019s \u201cRight\u201d to rule and that of his \u201cLawfull Issue,\u201d if he should have any, or of his \u201cCollateral Line,\u201d that is, his brother. When through ambition fostered by his noble nature Monmouth succumbs to Achitophel\u2019s Satanic temptation, Dryden again assumes the strategy of lamentation:\nUnblam\u2019d of Life (Ambition set aside,)\r\nNot stain\u2019d with Cruelty, nor puft with Pride;\r\nHow happy had he been, if Destiny\r\nHad higher plac\u2019d his Birth, or not so high!\r\nHis Kingly Vertues might have claim\u2019d a Throne,\r\nAnd blest all other Countries but his own:\r\nBut charming Greatness, since so few refuse;\r\n\u2018Tis Juster to Lament him, than Accuse.\nThe master stroke here is Dryden\u2019s sympathy toward Monmouth\u2019s ambiguous position in the hierarchy resulting from the circumstances of his birth (not his but Charles\u2019s fault) coupled with his insistence (as well as Charles\u2019s own) that nevertheless he remains illegitimate. Even if he were legitimate, Dryden implies, he would never be the heir (because he has shown by his character that he could never merit it?); he might have blessed other countries with his noble virtues (through royal intermarriage), but not\u2014and never\u2014his own.\nDryden also portrays the \u201cBest\u201d of the \u201cMalecontents\u201d assembled by Achitophel\u2014that is, primarily, the Country party among the Lords\u2014as being essentially well-meaning but \u201cSeduc\u2019d by Impious Arts\u201d into believing the \u201cpower of Monarchy\u201d a threat to \u201cProperty.\u201d Thus identifying with and appealing to the moderates in the House of Lords, Dryden does not want to seem to be maligning his betters. He saves his nastiness generally for the middle and lower classes, whom he portrays as motivated by \u201cInterest,\u201d parsimonious \u201cHusbandry,\u201d desire for \u201cPreferment,\u201d or, under the hypocritical guise of (dissenting) religion, the sheer desire \u201call things to Destroy,\u201d especially monarchy itself. Dryden portrays the common \u201cherd\u201d as mindless, those \u201cWho think too little, and who talk too much.\u201d\nDryden\u2019s next justly famous portraits are representatives of the three classes. From the truly rebellious aristocrats (implicitly a mere fringe group) he selects his old enemy Buckingham, whom he portrays as too inconstant in his moods, postures, and political positions to remain constant to any one\u2014or, by implication, to the king.\u00a0Dryden\u2019s representative of the middle class is the hypocritical Puritan Shimei (Slingsby Bethel, sheriff of London), whose animosity against the office of king itself is so strong he fears not to curse \u201cHeavens Annointed,\u201d and whose very religion is simply a means for his personal \u201cGain.\u201d As do modern satirists with televangelists, Dryden turns Shimei\u2019s canting rhetoric against him:\nFor Shimei, though not prodigal of pelf,\r\nYet lov\u2019d his wicked Neighbour as himself:\r\nWhen two or three were gather\u2019d to declaim\r\nAgainst the Monarch of Jerusalem,\r\nShimei was always in the midst of them:\r\nAnd, if they Curst the King when he was by,\r\nWould rather Curse, than break good Company.\nIn a wonderful marriage of sound, sight, and sense, the middle triplet here inserts a third line into the usual couplet form as if in imitation of the insinuation of Antichrist Shimei into the midst of his disciples.\n\r\nDryden\u2019s representative of the lower class is Corah, who stands for Titus Oates, the weaver\u2019s son who was the archwitness of the Popish Plot. Dryden portrays him with dripping sarcasm:\nHis Memory, miraculously great,\r\nCould Plots, exceeding mans belief, repeat;\r\nWhich, therefore cannot be accounted Lies,\r\nFor humane Wit could never such devise.\nIf Shimei perverts the words of Scripture for his interest, Corah perverts words in the very citadel of justice, where oaths are supposed to guarantee the truth. Indeed, all of Dryden\u2019s villains assault the social logos through disloyalty, hypocrisy, and perjury, thus challenging the underwriting divine Logos.\n\r\nIn addition to discrediting his opponents thus, Dryden discredits their political theory. Achitophel\u2019s articulation of Lockean theory\u2014\u201cthe People have a Right Supreme / To make their Kings; for Kings are made for them. / All Empire is no more than Pow\u2019r in Trust\u201d\u2014is belied by his own ambition for power. But Dryden appears to take his theory seriously and to approach the question moderately. Rejecting the position of absolute monarchy, Dryden equally rejects the position of social-contract theorists who argue that the people can take their bond back, a secession resulting, for Dryden, in Hobbist political instability:\nIf they may Give and Take when e\u2019r they please,\r\nNot Kings alone, (the Godheads Images,)\r\nBut Government it self at length must fall\r\nTo Natures state; where all have Right to all.\nPurloining Locke\u2019s own concept of prudence, Dryden then asks in his most conciliatory mode, \u201cYet, grant our Lords the People Kings can make, / What Prudent men a setled Throne woud shake?\u201d While Dryden appears to be adopting a Burkean conservatism based on the weight of tradition\u2014as is obvious from all the references to God\u2019s involvement in anointing and supporting kings throughout the poem\u2014the grammatical uncertainty of the first line images forth the political anarchy that would ensue if anyone but God\u2014lords, commoners, kings themselves, by tampering with succession\u2014were to make a king.\nDryden then proceeds to portray the king\u2019s friends as a loyal group of peers, bishops, judges, and even the former speaker of the (now rebellious) House of Commons. The greatest wielder of words in the poem is David himself, who comes forward finally to vindicate his power and position. Weary of abuse despite his wonted clemency and long-suffering, David insists that even if he has only a part of government, the part belongs to him, cannot be attenuated by any other part, and is \u201cto Rule.\u201d Dryden endows his speech with magisterial authority:\nWithout my Leave a future King to choose,\r\nInfers a Right the Present to Depose:\r\nTrue, they Petition me t\u2019approve their Choise,\r\nBut Esau\u2019s Hands suite ill with Jacob\u2019s Voice.\r\nDavid becomes more aggressive as he progresses:\n\r\nWhat then is left but with a Jealous Eye\r\nTo guard the Small remains of Royalty?\r\nThe Law shall still direct my peacefull Sway,\r\nAnd the same Law teach Rebels to Obey.\nThus Dryden stakes out for David/Charles a middle ground between extremes of arbitrary or anarchic rule. He insists on the king\u2019s lawful prerogative granted by the unwritten constitution and forming part of a balanced system of government. The other parts of that balance have threatened the very Ark of the Covenant, and so David himself now threatens, \u201cLaw they require, let Law then shew her Face,\u201d for \u201cLawfull Pow\u2019r is still Superiour found.\u201d So David will punish the transgressors, who will actually devour themselves by turning against each other. Dryden closes the poem by underwriting David\u2019s words with the Word of God: \u201cHe said. Th\u2019Almighty, nodding, gave Consent: / And Peals of Thunder shook the Firmament.\u201d Dryden\u2019s final touch, then, is a kind of apotheosis: David and God become one: \u201cAnd willing Nations knew their Lawfull Lord.\u201d\n\r\nAbsalom and Achitophel was a celebration of Charles\u2019s triumph over his foes in the Exclusion Crisis. As it was published in November 1681, Shaftesbury was on trial for treason. But that triumph seemed short-lived, for Shaftesbury, to Dryden the archconspirator, got off scot-free, and his supporters cast a medal in his honor. Early in 1682 Dryden published another attack on Shaftesbury and his followers, The Medall. A Satyre against Sedition. The controlling fiction of the poem is the two sides of the medal, one with a portrait of Shaftesbury, the other with a portrait of the City of London. Again portraying Shaftesbury\u2019s political inconstancy as a function of inconstancy of character, Dryden says sardonically of the medal, \u201cCou\u2019d it have form\u2019d his ever-changing Will, / The various Piece had tir\u2019d the Graver\u2019s Skill.\u201d Dryden traces him through his tortuous twists of allegiance until his final revelation of the \u201cfiend\u201d within.\nOn the other hand, Dryden addresses \u201cLondon, thou great Emporium of our Isle\u201d again in a lamentory mode, and one cannot help remembering his praise of the city in Annus Mirabilis as the emporium of England\u2019s imperialist trade. As in Absalom and Achitophel, Dryden spares the virtuous Londoners from blame, but he stridently attacks the \u201cFool and Knave\u201d who corruptly misdirect the city\u2019s great energies. Here one sees as plainly as anywhere Dryden\u2019s fear of and contempt for the rising middle class that couched its political ambitions in religious rhetoric:\nIn Gospel phrase their Chapmen they betray:\r\nTheir Shops are Dens, the Buyer is their Prey.\r\nThe Knack of Trades is living on the Spoyl;\r\nThey boast, ev\u2019n when each other they beguile.\r\nCustomes to steal is such a trivial thing,\r\nThat \u2018tis their Charter, to defraud their King.\nDryden has perceived the inherent danger of bourgeois individualism and incipient capitalism: the selfish, predatory accumulation of wealth by means of fraud and tax evasion. These are descendants of the Commonwealth\u2019s men who murdered a previous king and who are still bent on the destruction not only of \u201cKings\u201d but of \u201cKingly Pow\u2019r\u201d per se.\n\r\nIn both sections of the poem, Dryden satirizes (this time he does not pretend to rational debate) the political theory of the Whigs. In both he reduces republican theory to a version of might makes right, here applied to the concept of majority rule, \u201cThe Most have right, the wrong is in the Few\u201d:\nAlmighty Crowd, thou shorten\u2019st all dispute;\r\nPow\u2019r is thy Essence; Wit thy Attribute!\r\nNor Faith nor Reason make thee at a stay,\r\nThou leapst o\u2019r all eternal truths, in thy Pindarique way!\nThe wit in these lines resides not only in the brilliant imitative spillover of the concluding alexandrine but also in the mock theology: as in the disputes over whether God\u2019s will or his reason be his primary essence, Dryden follows his sarcastic reference to the crowd as \u201cAlmighty\u201d with a pseudovoluntarist position, reducing reason or \u201cWit\u201d to a mere \u201cAttribute.\u201d But, as he had suggested early in his writing,\nIf Sovereign Right by Sovereign Pow\u2019r they scan,\r\nThe same bold Maxime holds in God and Man:\r\nGod were not safe, his Thunder cou\u2019d they shun\r\nHe shou\u2019d be forc\u2019d to crown another Son.\nThe marvelous irony of the last line works especially well when one reads from the caesura of the penultimate line through the enjambment to fall hard upon the reversed iamb of the last line: the implication is that even He would be forced, like Charles, to declare another son his legitimate heir. The pun on crown, referring to Christ\u2019s crown of thorns, is savage.\n\r\nThe best\u2014because, perhaps, the most prophetic\u2014parts of the poem are the early series of analogies to political majority rule and the later series of images of clipping of the royal power until the monarch is purely ceremonial\u2014as indeed he/she became after the revolution Dryden so desperately feared. Dryden mocks the notion that majority rule is stable, citing historical examples of mistakes resulting in the deaths of heroes, among them Socrates. As he comes closer to his own time, he wickedly asserts, \u201cCrowds err not, though to both extremes they run; / To kill the Father, and recall the Son.\u201d His most scathing indictment of this creeping relativism occurs in the following lines:\nSome think the Fools were most, as times went then;\r\nBut now the World\u2019s o\u2019r stock\u2019d with prudent men.\r\nThe common Cry is ev\u2019n Religion\u2019s Test;\r\nThe Turk\u2019s is, at Constantinople, best;\r\nIdols in India, Popery at Rome;\r\nAnd our own Worship onely true at home:\r\nAnd true, but for the time; \u2018tis hard to know\r\nHow long we please it shall continue so.\r\nThis side to day, and that to morrow burns;\r\nSo all are God-a\u2019mighties in their turns.\nInstead of mythologizing the political theory he defends, Dryden attempts to justify it on pragmatic grounds, that their British forefathers attempted to avoid factional civil war by securing peaceful succession of both power and property through primogeniture. God has already tried us, Dryden argues, by giving the republicans what they wanted during the Commonwealth, and look what happened. And he predicts a similar cannibalistic civil war if Shaftesbury and his cronies succeed, for all will want a piece of the power, and none will be constrained by law. His concluding prophecy seems a bitter wish-fulfillment:\nThus inborn Broyles the Factions wou\u2019d ingage,\r\nOr Wars of Exil\u2019d Heirs, or Foreign Rage,\r\nTill halting Vengeance overtook our Age:\r\nAnd our wild Labours, wearied into Rest,\r\nReclin\u2019d us on a rightfull Monarch\u2019s Breast.\nIf as at the end of Absalom and Achitophel Dryden is again collapsing both earthly and heavenly monarch together, his vision has progressed from apotheosis to apocalypse, the ultimate curse of the satirist.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Exclusion Crisis, Dryden continued to attack the Stuarts\u2019 enemies. He contributed satiric portraits of old nemeses now openly Whiggish, Settle and Shadwell, to a sequel to Absalom and Achitophel, written mostly by another young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Nahum Tate. He contributed politically satirical prologues and epilogues to several plays. He wrote another play with Nathaniel Lee,\u00a0The Duke of Guise\u00a0(1682), which exploited the analogy between current events and those in France a century before; he wrote a Vindication of that play (1683); and in 1684 he translated Louis Maimbourg\u2019s History of the League, the source of most of his knowledge of that French analogue. The stridency of Dryden\u2019s tone increases proportionally to the growing strength of the Stuart position, especially after the discovery in the summer of 1683 of the Rye House Plot, an alleged plan to assassinate Charles and James and foment a radical revolution based in London.\n\r\nIn the midst of this political activity Dryden published another major poem on an apparently radically different topic,\u00a0Religio Laici or a Laymans Faith\u00a0(1682). The poem is a response to another French work, recently translated by a friend of his into English as\u00a0A Critical History of the Old Testament\u00a0(1682). The original was by a French priest, Richard Simon, and employed emerging modern methods of scholarship to examine the biblical text, its errors and contradictions. Dryden\u2019s response is essentially a declaration of faith in the few fundamental truths of Christianity that are \u201cuncorrupt, sufficient, clear, intire, / In all things which our needfull Faith require,\u201d among them such doctrines as Original Sin and its consequences, especially death and the loss of heaven; the Incarnation of Christ; His Redemption and the consequent justification for the sin of Adam by means of the imputed righteousness of Christ extended to mankind.\nDryden had not really made a radical departure from his concurrent political poems, however. His attempt to steer a middle way between what he calls \u201cExtreme[s]\u201d concerning the issue of tradition in biblical interpretation is really a political stance, a proto-Burkean conservatism:\n\u2019Tis some Relief, that points not clearly known,\r\nWithout much hazard may be let alone:\r\nAnd, after hearing what our Church can say,\r\nIf still our Reason runs another way,\r\nThat private Reason \u2018tis more Just to curb,\r\nThan by Disputes the publick Peace disturb.\r\nFor points obscure are of small use to learn:\r\nBut Common quiet is\u00a0Mankind\u2019s\u00a0concern.\nThe extremes he attacks in the religious sphere are the same he has been attacking in the political: Catholics and Dissenters, the Catholics especially for their gnostic priesthood, the Dissenters for their pernicious doctrine of individual interpretation, which leads ultimately to the kind of political instability, disturbance of the \u201cPeace,\u201d and loss of \u201cCommon quiet\u201d detailed above. Dryden would have sided with\u00a0Edmund Burke\u00a0against the French Revolution, and he would have been appalled by\u00a0Thomas Jefferson\u00a0and\u00a0Thomas Paine.\nBy 1685, with the publication of\u00a0Sylvae, a poetical miscellany, Dryden had become a major translator, having turned his hand to\u00a0Ovid\u00a0and Virgil as early as 1680 (Ovid\u2019s Epistles) and adding more\u00a0Ovid\u00a0and\u00a0Theocritus\u00a0in 1684 (Miscellany Poems) and then especially\u00a0Lucretius\u00a0and Horace in 1685 (Sylvae). Dryden also apparently polished William Soames\u2019s translation of Nicolas Boileau-Despr\u00e9aux\u2019s\u00a0Art of Poetry\u00a0(1684) and contributed a dedication and life of\u00a0Plutarch\u00a0to a new edition of\u00a0Plutarchs Lives\u00a0(1683). While he would return to and memorably refine his versifying of Virgil in the next decade, among these early translations most notable are his deft handling of libertine psychology in\u00a0Ovid\u2019s epistles, especially the incestuous \u201cCanace to Macareus\"; his inspired if somber rendition of\u00a0Lucretius\u2019s atheistic arguments against fear of death; and his dextrous attempt at Pindarics in Horace\u2019s Ode 3.29. In these poems Dryden engages in some of his most experimental prosody. That Dryden was occupied with issues of translation is evidenced not only by his preface to\u00a0Sylvae\u00a0but also by his panegyric \u201cTo the Earl of Roscomon, on his Excellent Essay on Translated Verse,\u201d prefaced to the edition of that essay in 1684. Dryden\u2019s poem celebrates translation as an imperialist act whereby Greece, Rome, Italy, France, and now England appropriate the best from the countries they have (ostensibly) superseded.\nIn 1684 Dryden also published what many consider his best elegiac poem, \u201cTo the Memory of Mr. Oldham.\u201d Dryden\u2019s praise is doubly generous: first, he honors this kindred spirit in satire as having arrived at the goal and won the prize, that is, honor in the field of satire per se, before himself; second, Dryden laments Oldham\u2019s early death but insists that longer time would have added nothing to Oldham\u2019s wit and verse but metrical regularity and \u201cthe dull sweets of Rime\u201d\u2014like those of Dryden himself in his satires and indeed in this poem. The poem, like the early elegy to Hastings, closes with no metaphysical consolation, but with these grim, haunting lines:\nOnce more, hail and farewel; farewel thou young,\r\nBut ah too short,\u00a0Marcellus\u00a0of our Tongue;\r\nThy Brows with Ivy, and with Laurels bound;\r\nBut Fate and gloomy Night encompass thee around.\nDryden\u2019s next major poetic task was another unpleasant one, another elegy, this time for Charles II, who died in February 1685. As poet laureate and historiographer royal, Dryden had to produce an official, public elegy, one that lamented the deceased king, praised his accomplishments, and underwrote the transition to a new king, around whom swirled such tempests of controversy. For some time Dryden had been preparing an opera to celebrate Charles II, one that was finally produced in late 1685 as\u00a0Albion and Albanius. In it he continued the metrical experimentations of his translations. Relying on this metrical virtuosity, Dryden produced\u00a0Threnodia Augustalis: A Funeral-Pindarique Poem Sacred to the Happy Memory of King Charles II\u00a0(1685).\nDryden draws a scene of pathos designed to extract pity and loyalty from even the most recalcitrant of his audience, especially in the light of his rehearsal of Charles\u2019s mild temper, forgiveness, and contributions to an English renascence of both arts and trade after the havoc wreaked by \u201cRebellion\u201d and \u201cFaction.\u201d Dryden portrays Charles\u2019s greatest contribution as his intrepid support of the principle of legitimate succession. In imitative rhythms Dryden delineates the progress of this principle down through British history:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Succession, of a long Descent,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Which Chastly in the Channells ran,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And from our Demi-gods began,\r\nEqual almost to Time in its extent,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through Hazzards numberless and great,\r\nThou hast deriv\u2019d this mighty Blessing down,\r\nAnd fixt the fairest Gemm that decks th\u2019Imperial Crown.\nThat succession, Dryden insists, falls upon Charles\u2019s brother, whether the Opposition likes it or not, and he deserves it because of his unswerving devotion to the \u201cplighted vows\u201d of loyalty. In a desperate wish fulfillment, Dryden pretends to prophesy, \u201cwith a distant view, I see / Th\u2019amended Vows of\u00a0English\u00a0Loyalty\u201d\u2014a vision that he once again transforms into the prosperity of British imperialism in the wake of its \u201cConquering Navy,\u201d which, under James, will reduce the oceans of the world to acknowledging their rightful \u201cLord.\u201d In the finale of\u00a0Albion and Albanius, Dryden would try again to rally the nation behind this theme. Amid the final chorus, \u201cFame\u00a0rises out of the middle of the Stage, standing on a Globe; on which is the Arms of\u00a0England.\u201d The epilogue concludes a crescendo of appeals to trust with the following version of the myth of human word-as-bond underwritten by the Divine Word:\nHe Plights his Faith; and we believe him just\r\nHis Honour is to Promise, ours to Trust.\r\nThus\u00a0Britain\u2019s\u00a0Basis on a Word is laid,\r\nAs by a Word the World it self was made.\nOn his deathbed, Charles II declared his conversion to Catholicism, and his Catholic brother James succeeded to the throne, issuing some \u201cRoyal Papers\u201d detailing not only Charles\u2019s but James\u2019s first wife\u2019s Catholic faith. Meanwhile, Dryden himself converted, and he was ordered to defend those Royal Papers, which he did in a pamphlet exchange with prominent Anglican bishop Edward Stillingfleet. Apparently Dryden felt obliged to publish another philosophical poem, documenting his own confession of faith and answering his earlier\u00a0Religio Laici. The result was\u00a0The Hind and the Panther\u00a0(1687), Dryden\u2019s longest original poem. Ever since, he has been attacked for insincerity and opportunism. James Anderson Winn, Dryden\u2019s modern biographer, argues that from the time of his relationship with the Howards, Dryden was intimately connected with Catholic recusants, one of whom was a prominent cardinal, and one of whom may have been his own wife. His sons were Catholic, and the youngest was studying to be a priest. So his conversion may have taken place over a long period of time. And he himself argues persuasively in the third part of\u00a0The Hind and the Panther\u00a0that he really stood little to gain and far more to lose by becoming Catholic, mostly because up until that time the aging James had no son, and his new duchess, Maria Beatrice, had lost several babies: the throne would revert to a Protestant upon his death.\nBiographers will never ascertain just why Dryden converted, and critics will probably always accuse him of being an opportunist. But there is a logic to his conversion if one studies his works. They are preoccupied with the need for political stability and the concomitant necessity of loyalty to de jure monarchs, whose titles are inherited through primogenitive patrilinearity. As Dryden shifted from his early optimism concerning Britain\u2019s future as an expansionist imperial power to his defensive posture with regard to the principle of succession amid threats of civil war, his own loyalty to James and to unbroken succession grew stronger. It appears that the more he examined his\u00a0Religio Laici\u00a0position, the more he came to doubt the Church of England\u2019s claim to authority. By the time he wrote\u00a0The Hind and the Panther\u00a0the analogy between church and state was ironclad. Only Catholicism can trace its origins in unbroken succession back to the primitive church; Anglicanism dates from\u00a0Henry VIII\u2019s break with Rome (a break that occurred for dubious reasons at that, Dryden argues throughout). And without a final arbiter in doctrinal matters, no church can claim authority: \u201cBecause no disobedience can ensue, / Where no submission to a Judge is due.\u201d Dryden\u2019s fears of political anarchy are reflected in his fears of doctrinal anarchy, especially where the Protestant theory of individual interpretation of the Bible obtains. Thus it should come as no surprise that he would finally swear allegiance to Rome. Moreover, Dryden\u2019s religious theory of infallibility as residing in both pope\u00a0and\u00a0General Council can be seen as homologous to his political theory of a government balanced between king and Parliament. And his religious theory of authority based upon historical priority can be seen as homologous to not just a political but an economic theory of succession: \u201cAn old possession stands, till Elder quitts the claim\u201d is as true for power and property as it is for the True Church. The problematics of the transmission of the Savior\u2019s \u201cTestament\u201d are developed in terms of homology to a contested will, precisely because an unerring guide is needed in both religious and sociopolitical realms. Dryden has the Catholic Hind assert to the Anglican Panther, \u201cFor that which must direct the whole, must be / Bound in one bond of faith and unity\u201d: both church and state need one leader, to whom his subjects are bound by word-as-bond. In language that expresses Dryden\u2019s merged religious and political theory, the Hind concludes triumphantly that \u201cthe mother church \u2026 with unrivall\u2019d claim ascends the throne.\nNot only Dryden\u2019s theory but also his very fable mingles political with religious. All along the poem seems to have a dual raison d\u2019\u00eatre: to explain Dryden\u2019s conversion but also to achieve an alliance between Catholics and Anglicans against the Dissenters. Dryden\u2019s antipathy to the latter is essentially political: their theory of individual interpretation leads to not only religious but political anarchy.\nFinally the ending\u2014and perhaps the real import\u2014of Dryden\u2019s poem is secular. The Catholic Hind finally despairs of an accommodation with the\u00a0 Anglican Panther. In vatic style Dryden offers an optimistic, wish-fulfillment prophecy of Catholic hegemony over an Anglican establishment ungrateful ultimately to James\u2019s new policy of religious tolerance. But it is as if he could not sustain the optimism. Instead he tacked on a dire prophecy of the advent, at the death of James, of the \u201cUsurper,\u201d William of Orange. There is no final apotheosis, no final apocalypse, no final justice. The \u201cGlorious\u201d Revolution that did occur almost immediately forever destroyed Dryden\u2019s faith in a fulfillment of his religious/political vision in his own lifetime. Instead, he moved to the margins of the new order to carry on his critique.\nIn the meantime, the one event Catholics desired most occurred: James and his queen had a son in June 1688. Of course, it was the one event most feared by the Protestants. Almost as Dryden had prophesied, the Protestants invited William and Mary to become cosovereigns, and James fled the country. In\u00a0Britannia Rediviva\u00a0(1688) Dryden\u2019s celebration of the prince seems strained, almost hysterical. He desperately prays that England be spared another civil war: \u201cHere stop the Current of the sanguine flood, / Require not, Gracious God, thy Martyrs Blood.\u201d Yet he cautions the Catholic (potential) martyrs, \u201cNor yet conclude all fiery\u00a0Trials\u00a0past, / For Heav\u2019n will exercise us to the last.\u201d And all he can praise at the end is no new order but James\u2019s \u201cJustice\u201d\u2014darling attribute of God himself\u2014and James\u2019s stoic endurance of whatever \u201cFortune\u201d and \u201cFate\u201d will bring. James Garrison seems right when he argues that Dryden has run out of enabling myth to sustain the Stuarts.\nIn a famous passage in\u00a0The Hind and the Panther, Dryden assumes the posture of one who has humbled his ambitious desire for fame. Almost self-pityingly he writes of his (eventual) loss of his offices of poet laureate and historiographer royal, as well as the income that was supposed to go with them:\n\u2018Tis nothing thou hast giv\u2019n, then add thy tears\r\nFor a long race of unrepenting years:\r\n\u2018Tis nothing yet; yet all thou hast to give,\r\nThen add those\u00a0may-be\u00a0years thou hast to live.\r\nYet nothing still: then poor, and naked come,\r\nThy father will receive his unthrift home,\r\nAnd thy blest Saviour\u2019s bloud discharge the mighty sum.\nAt some level Dryden may have believed that, but immediately after the revolution he began to write again for the stage, partly to make money but also partly to assert himself: his talent, even as his nemesis Shadwell was made the new poet laureate; his spirit amid the storm of political conflict; his worth and thus his justifiable fame. Moreover, though the Hind claims to \u201cdiscipline\u201d her son, Dryden, \u201cWhose uncheck\u2019d fury to revenge wou\u2019d run,\u201d Dryden could not control his Jacobitical rage, which broke out in his later works in various satiric fashions.\nIn subtler ways Dryden inculcated his Jacobitism into\u00a0King Arthur\u00a0(1691), an opera that celebrates Britain\u2019s resistance to foreign invaders, and\u00a0Love Triumphant\u00a0(1694), his final play, a tragicomedy featuring a prince who rebels against his father and against the incest taboo, and concluding with a nonresolution to the issues because the prince turns out to be unrelated to either father or sister (by implication, Mary Stuart is still her father\u2019s daughter and a usurper). Dryden also inculcated Jacobitism into a series of prologues and epilogues, prose works, and especially brilliant new translations, most notably selected satires of\u00a0Juvenal\u00a0and\u00a0Persius\u00a0(1693), his Virgil (1697), and\u00a0Fables Ancient and Modern\u00a0(1700).\nMost of the work of his last years was in translation, apparently as a way of achieving a modicum of political and economic. He returned to favorites, such as\u00a0Ovid, Virgil, and Homer, and added Boccaccio and\u00a0Chaucer. Especially noteworthy is the malleability of Dryden\u2019s heroic couplets. In the\u00a0Aeneis, for example, he occasionally opens up the couplet rather than, like Pope, closing it virtually all the time. He spices couplets with triplets, masculine with feminine endings. He is a past master at the enjambment and particularly of metric variation in the first hemistich. He is also a master weaver of motif, as in the leitmotiv of\u00a0labor\u00a0in the\u00a0Aeneis, a Virgilian key word and concept he variously translates as\u00a0Labour\u00a0and\u00a0Toyl\u2014sometimes adding to the Virgilian original and always emphasizing the need to build a kingdom on hard work, as opposed to the easy gains in Carthage. He also embellishes the original with lines such as the following, which emphasize the emerging theme of self-reliance in his final works: Dryden\u2019s Sybil praises Aeneas as being \u201csecure of Soul, unbent with Woes\u201d and advises him, \u201cThe more thy Fortune frowns, the more oppose.\u201d Dryden\u2019s Aeneas answers, in lines that expand on the original:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no Terror to my view,\r\nNo frightful Face of Danger can be new.\r\nInur\u2019d to suffer, and resolv\u2019d to dare,\r\nThe Fates, without my Pow\u2019r, shall be without my Care.\nDryden\u2019s Aeneas, then, must learn\u2014like Cleomenes before him and Dryden\u2019s \u201cHonour\u2019d Kinsman,\u201d John Driden of Chesterton, after him in Dryden\u2019s canon\u2014to stand fixed on his own firm center. Aeneas\u2019s boast seems Dryden\u2019s own.\nMeanwhile, Dryden continued to write excellent occasional verse, from prologues and epilogues to elegies to verse epistles.\u00a0Eleonora\u00a0(1692), a commissioned elegy, was originally to be entitled \u201cThe Pattern,\u201d and Dryden indeed makes the countess a pattern of Christian piety and charity, as well as of aristocratic wife and motherhood.\nIn \u201cTo my Dear Friend Mr. Congreve\u201d (1694), as in his elegy on Oldham, Dryden assumes a magnanimous pose, answering, as it were, his mock-panegyric\u00a0Mac Flecknoe\u00a0with a genuine panegyric, featuring this time a legitimate succession. Dryden\u2019s laurels should descend to Congreve, representative of a new generation of dramatic poets, but they have been intercepted, \u201cFor\u00a0Tom\u00a0the Second reigns like\u00a0Tom\u00a0the first,\u201d that is, Tom Rymer has succeeded Tom Shadwell as historiographer royal (not poet laureate). Nevertheless, Dryden prophesies,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thou shalt be seen,\r\n(Tho\u2019 with some short Parenthesis between:)\r\nHigh on the Throne of Wit; and seated there,\r\nNot mine (that\u2019s little) but thy Lawrel wear.\nThough never actually poet laureate, Congreve certainly rose \u201chigh on a throne of his own labors rear\u2019d,\u201d for he became for centuries considered the premier Restoration comedic playwright.\nIn 1697 Dryden took time out from his other chores to pen one of the greatest odes in the English language,\u00a0Alexander\u2019s Feast; Or The Power of Musique. He had written a less remarkable poem on the subject a decade earlier. The original setting by the composer Jeremiah Clarke has been lost, but George Frideric Handel\u2019s magnificent setting of 1736 exists, and anyone who has ever heard it must marvel at the incredible virtuosity on the parts of both poet and musician. As has been often noted, the poem is a celebration of the power of art. The musician Timotheus modulates Alexander the Great through several moods, manipulating him with sure hand. Not only is Timotheus the real hero, but Alexander is shown, as in Dryden\u2019s friend\u00a0Nathaniel Lee\u2019s portrait of him in his\u00a0The Rival Queens\u00a0(1677), to be the victim of his own reckless passions, from his pride in his quasi-divinity to his proverbial drunkenness, to his martial vanity followed immediately by pity for the vanquished foe, to his destructive amorousness, and finally to pointless, destructive vengeance. Some critics have seen an implied critique of William III in the poem, and the pitiable portrait of the vanquished Darius, \u201cDeserted at his utmost Need, / By those his former Bounty fed,\u201d would certainly have reminded Dryden\u2019s audience of the deserted James II. But the poem is a paean to the triumph of art over all military power, over all rulers with delusions of divinity.\nDryden ended his life in squabbles with his publisher and in bitterness over his own fate and that of not only his king but the principle of succession he had fought so hard to defend. He concluded his career with a contribution to a revision of John Fletcher\u2019s\u00a0Pilgrim. His prologue continues his attack, begun in \u201cTo my Honour\u2019d Kinsman, John Driden\u201d on the latest of his detractors,\u00a0Sir Richard Blackmore\u00a0and Luke Milbourne, poetaster and quack doctor, and the epilogue continues his ongoing attack against self-righteous Puritans who attack the stage and the age in general. But his best contribution is a fitting epitaph, both for himself and his century. Dryden portrays Momus, the god of mockery, showing up at a celebration of the century. Momus\u2019s comments are devastating, as he attacks the god or goddess associated with each third of the century. To Diana, patroness of the early Stuarts, Momus comments, \u201cThy Chase had a Beast in View\u201d; to Mars, patron of the Interregnum, \u201cThy Wars brought nothing about\u201d; to Venus, patroness of the later Stuarts, \u201cThy Lovers were all untrue.\u201d This last is perhaps his most devastating statement, for it refers not only to the licentious loves of Charles\u2019s time but to James\u2019s subjects\u2019 infidelity. No wonder the expiring poet would with his last breath sing, \u201c\u2018Tis well an Old Age is out, / And time to begin a New.\u201d Dryden meant not only the century itself but his own old age. He could only hope that he was on his way to a new life, one free from the strife and disappointment of this life, one appreciative of the celestial strains of his great poetry.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
