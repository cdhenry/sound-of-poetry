His first collection of poetry,\u00a0Palm Trees\u00a0(2012), won the Norma Farber first book award from the Poetry Society of America. Judge\u00a0Timothy Liu\u00a0noted of Twemlow\u2019s work, \u201cReading Twemlow gives one a deep sense about what's exciting about the lyrical possibilities embodied not in just of a\u00a0first\u00a0book of poems but\u00a0any\u00a0book of poems. . . . I was enticed by verbal savvy, consequential wordplay, cultural \u00e9lan.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nTwemlow\u2019s films have played Athens, FLEX, Slamdance, Shnit International, SXSW, Tribeca, and other film festivals.
