Addressing the connection between personal and public histories in The Public Gardens in a 2012 Kenyon Review online interview with Andrew David King, Norton stated, \u201cThere\u2019s Slavery and Jim Crow and the Holocaust and the Great Irish Famine and Ellis Island and the Risorgimento and AIDS\u2014and then there are the people, my people\u2014me. It used to shock me when the tragic would smash into the mundane or the absurd or the bathetic. \u2026 But that kind of abrasion\u2014the past, in a body in the present\u2014occurs when there\u2019s intimacy\u2014attention being a form of intimacy, and a responsibility.\u201d In a review of The Public Gardens for the Otis Review, Elizabeth Robinson observed, \u201cNorton\u2019s rejoinder to suffering, shame, loss, and the drudge of economic necessity is to encounter the world with a keen interest that is by turns plaintive and robustly humorous. \u2026 Right inside [the] gap of transition and loss, Norton locates a site of empathy and mystery.\u201d \u00a0 Norton\u2019s debut collection, The Public Gardens: Poems and History (2011), was a finalist for an LA Times Book Prize. Her work has been featured in the anthologies New California Writing (2013, edited by Dayle Wattawa and Kirk Glaser), Al-Mutanabbi Street Starts Here (2012, edited by Beau Beausoleil and Deema Shehabi), and As If It Fell from the Sun (2012, edited by Colleen Lookingbill and Elizabeth Robinson). \u00a0 With Calvin Bedient, Robert Hass, and Brenda Hillman, Norton helped establish the New California Poetry series for the University of California Press. In 2002, she received a Lannan Foundation residency. Her visual collages have appeared on the covers of books by Julie Carr, Claudia Rankine, and Stacy Szymaszek. A senior editor at the University of California at Berkeley Bancroft Library, Norton lives in Oakland.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
