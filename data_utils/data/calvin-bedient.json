Influenced by Walt Whitman and Gertrude Stein, Bedient composes poems that connect interior and experienced landscapes. In a conversation with poet and editor Rusty Morrison on the poems in The Multiple, Bedient stated, \u201cI listen for the work\u2019s difference even from itself. All on its own, as it were, the poetry wants to show that, loosed from its common discursive ruts, experience tumbles forth in a mixture of dismay and delight. Even so, the work\u2019s unresolvable elements may join together in a vital motion that surpasses or at least contests its splintering. \u2026 The poems sometimes behave as if they want to attain to an uber stage of music and feeling that will bind the elements, bind them in flight.\u201d \u00a0 Bedient is the author of several poetry collections, including The Multiple (2012), Days of Unwilling (2008), The Violence of the Morning (2002), and Candy Necklace (1997). His critical writing includes The Yeats Brothers and Modernism\u2019s Love of Mobility (2008), He Do the Police in Different Voices: The \u201cWaste Land\u201d and Its Protagonist (1986), In the Heart\u2019s Last Kingdom: Robert Penn Warren\u2019s Major Poetry (1984), Eight Contemporary Poets (1974), and Architects of the Self: George Eliot, D.H. Lawrence, and E.M. Forster (1972).  \u00a0 A founding editor of the New California Poetry Series, Bedient has also coedited Lana Turner: A Journal of Poetry and Opinion and VOLT. He is a professor emeritus at UCLA and lives in Santa Monica, California.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
