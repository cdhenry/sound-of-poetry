He has published numerous volumes of poetry, including A Change of Heart (2018), Choice Words: Poems 1970-2005, Second Home (2001), Graphic Scenes (1994), and Light Years (1977). Blasing\u2019s poetry has been praised for its precision and control. Pat Monaghan in Booklist applauded Blasing as \u201ca mature talent with a firm sense of craft.\u201d Blasing is also a translator of the works of Nazim Hikmet, one of the great modern Turkish poets. Hikmet revolutionized Turkish poetry by introducing free verse and modern poetic techniques, and combining these with traditional and folk styles. Blasing\u2019s translations are written in collaboration with his wife, scholar Mutlu Konuk, a native of Turkey. Konuk is has taught at Pomona College and Brown University, and she has published critical studies on American poetry.\nThe couple first discovered Hikmet\u2019s work after their honeymoon in Turkey. Upon returning to the United States, Blasing began researching Turkish poets and found a volume of Hikmet\u2019s work in French translation. Both Blasing and Konuk enjoy \u201chis fresh imagery and spirited tone,\u201d as Blasing remembered in an interview with Light Millenium. \u201cI wanted to translate him to see what he was saying, my French being only adequate, and Mutlu wanted to see what he would sound like in English.\u201d\nThe couple has gone on to publish numerous volumes of Hikmet\u2019s poetry in translation, as well as his Human Landscapes from My Country: An Epic Novel in Verse (2009). Reviewing their translation of Poems of Nazim Hikmet (2002), a Publishers Weekly writer stated that the poems \u201cconvey the power and originality of the work.\u201d Hikmet\u2019s dramatic Human Landscapes, begun while the poet was imprisoned, is a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d and \u201ca powerful read,\u201d according to Keith Hitchins in World Literature Today. Hitchins added, \u201cThe translators have done full justice to the original.\u201d\nBlasing has received grants from the Ingram Merrill Foundation and a translation fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. He is a professor of English at the Community College of Rhode Island.\n", "attrs": {}}
