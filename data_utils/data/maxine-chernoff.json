Winner of the PIP Gertrude Stein Award for Innovative Poetry in 2006, Chernoff, in an innovative, post-modern approach, often utilizes prose forms. Her collections of poetry include A Vegetable Emergency (1977); Utopia TV Store: prose poems (1979); New Faces of 1952 (1985), winner of the Carl Sandburg Award; Leap Year Day: New and Selected Poems (1990); and World: Poems 1991\u20132001 (2001).\nChernoff\u2019s poems can be surreal, witty, and politically engaged. In a review of World for Jacket Magazine, Rachel Loden found that \u201cwit cuts in and out of the melodic surge and flow\u201d of the volume. Chernoff references Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and Alfred Stieglitz and employs epigraphs from Ralph Waldo Emerson in one section, prompting Loden to note \u201cthe impressionistic structures of these poems, their hops and skips across a rippling surface that suggests the freedoms and pleasures of hypertext.\u201d\nChernoff has also written fiction, and her short story collection Signs of Devotion was a New York Times Notable Book in 1993. Her translations, with Paul Hoover, of the work of Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin won the PEN Center USA Translation Award.\nShe is an editor of the journal New American Writing and a professor at San Francisco State University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
