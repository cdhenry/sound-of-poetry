He later moved to Washington, DC, where he became known as one of the \u201cMass Transit\u201d poets of the early 1970s.\r\nWinch\u2019s first collection of poetry, Irish Musicians/American Friends (1985), won an American Book Award.

Guest described the book\u2019s \u201catmosphere of the bitter-sweet, the expert sense of line, and its many subtle and humorous ways of Washington, D.C.\u201d Winch\u2019s later books of poetry include The Drift of Things (2001) and Boy Drinkers (2007).\nWinch has received a National Endowment for the Arts Literature Fellowship in poetry, as well as grants from the District of Columbia Commission on the Arts and Humanities, the Maryland State Arts Council, and the Fund for Poetry.
