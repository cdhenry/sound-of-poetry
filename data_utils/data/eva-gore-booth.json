Just as important to her legacy, however, are the many pamphlets and essays she published while living in England that deal with the political issues of her day, including the fight for equal rights for women. In addition to being a writer, Gore-Booth was also a political activist, and one of the first female suffragists to advocate extending the vote to both female property owners and women in the working class. \u201cSex is an accident,\u201d Gore-Booth once wrote, summing up her motivation to fight for equal rights. Gore-Booth\u2019s equally strong belief in pacifism was evident in many of her works, including the protest play\u00a0The Buried Life of Deirdre\u00a0(1930).\n\r\nFrom an aristocratic background, Gore-Booth began writing poetry in the early 1890s, and her talent was immediately noticed by some well-known Irish literary figures, including William Butler Yeats. Recognizing that despite her talent Gore-Booth was still an undisciplined writer, Yeats gave her several books to read in an effort to help polish her craft. \u201cI\u2019m always ransacking Ireland for people to set at writing Irish things,\u201d Yeats wrote in an 1895 letter. \u201cShe does not know that she is the last victim\u2014but is deep in some books of Irish legends I sent her and might take fire.\u201d Indeed, in spite of the fact that Gore-Booth lived most of her adult life away from Ireland, many critics have maintained that her work is a good representation of Irish literature of the period.\n\r\nGore-Booth\u2019s poetry, especially such later works as\u00a0The One and the Many\u00a0and\u00a0The Egyptian Pillar,\u00a0include themes of social change and sexual liberation. For example, the latter collection makes numerous references to strong women from ancient times, including Sheba and Cleopatra. Two of her poetry collections,\u00a0The Perilous Light\u00a0and\u00a0Broken Glory,\u00a0published during World War I, express pacifist themes. Despite the praise she received from many contemporary critics, modern readers have largely neglected Gore-Booth\u2019s work. Some scholars believe that her writings should not be forgotten, however, because they offer a unique perspective on some of the most important issues of her time. \u201cGore-Booth deserves a far more prominent place in the canon of British literature of the early twentieth century,\u201d wrote John C. Hawley in the\u00a0Dictionary of Literary Biography.\n\r\nThe daughter of Anglo-Irish landowners, Gore-Booth was born in 1870 into a life of privilege. The private education she received helped spawn her independent thinking and creative self-expression. The death of her grandmother, Lady Hill, when Gore-Booth was nine years old was a shaping force throughout her life. In the years following Lady Hill\u2019s death, Gore-Booth felt the constant presence of her grandmother\u2019s spirit. Some critics have noted that such a belief led to Gore-Booth\u2019s lifelong interest in mysticism and theosophy, which she explores in many of her writings. In fact, spirituality is a central concern of her final two books of poetry,\u00a0The Shepherd of Eternity\u00a0and\u00a0The House of Three Windows.\n\r\nIn 1896, while on a trip to Italy, Gore-Booth met Esther Roper, a leading suffragist and activist. The two women became lifelong partners, although there is no evidence that they were lovers. Under Roper\u2019s tutelage, Gore-Booth became a leading voice in the suffragist movement, especially after they moved to the English industrial city of Manchester. There the two women helped female factory workers organize and fight for better working conditions. In 1900 Gore-Booth became a leading figure of the Manchester Trade Union Council, which was enormously influential in the formation of dozens of other female unions.\n\r\nPolitical activities never prevented Gore-Booth from writing, and she continued to publish regularly right up to the time of her death. Having suffered poor health throughout much of her adult life, Gore-Booth died of intestinal cancer on June 30, 1926, in London, where she had moved just a few years earlier. Shortly before she died, she privately published a magazine called\u00a0Urania,\u00a0which circulated around London. In it Gore-Booth made a prophetic statement that symbolizes much of what she believed. \u201cThere is a vista before us of a Spiritual progress which far transcends all political matters,\u201d she declared. \u201cIt is the abolition of the \u2018manly\u2019 and the \u2018womanly.\u2019 Will you not help to sweep them into the museum of antiques?\u201d\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Ireland & Northern Ireland"]}}
