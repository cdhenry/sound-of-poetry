He came to New York when he was seven and lived, first in poverty and then in a series of charity hospitals, on the Lower East Side. Greenberg died on Wards Island at age 23 of tuberculosis. Though his work was unpublished during his lifetime, he had a profound effect on Hart Crane, who took inspiration from Greenberg\u2019s sonically dense and richly imaged lyricism; scholars also note that Crane, in his poem \u201cEmblems of Conduct,\u201d took actual lines of Greenberg\u2019s poetry, slightly altered, as his own. \u00a0 James Laughlin first published a selection of Greenberg\u2019s poems as Poems from the Greenberg Manuscripts in 1939. Harold Holden and Jack McManis edited a more comprehensive overview, which included Greenberg\u2019s autobiographical piece \u201cBetween Historical Life,\u201d in Poems by Samuel Greenberg: A Selection from the Manuscripts (1947). Self Charm: Selected Sonnets and Other Poems, another selection of Greenberg\u2019s work,was edited by Michael Carr and Michael Smith and published in 2005. \u00a0 Sometimes described as a \u201csecond-wave Modernist,\u201d and said to have anticipated surrealism, Greenberg\u2019s work is known for its semantic and syntactic idiosyncrasies and strange flights of diction; Charles Bernstein has called Greenberg\u2019s poetry \u201ca radical form of sprung lyric\u2014a wild, sound-wracked syntactic syncretism that verges on the abstract and the rhapsodic, which I associate with Crane and Hopkins (and which also brings Blake to mind), but might also be described as a cross between Leo Gorcey reciting Shakespeare and the poetical works of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven.\u201d Greenberg\u2019s papers, including over 600 poems and fifteen notebooks, are housed in the Fales Collection at New York University.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"], "School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
