He attended the Coll\u00e8ge Charlemagne, where he became friends with the poet G\u00e9rard de Nerval. Gautier was first interested in painting but turned to poetry and became an early proponent of Romanticism. With the publication of his first collection of poetry, Albertus (1832), and his novel Mademoiselle de Maupin (1835), he shifted his allegiance from Romanticism to the burgeoning philosophy of l\u2019art pour l\u2019art, or \u201cart for art\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\r\nArt and travel influenced Gautier\u2019s creative work and journalism. His collections of poems Espa\u00f1a (1845) and Voyage en Espagne (1845) were the result of travels to Spain. As an art critic, he covered the theater, visual arts, and salons for La Presse. An extremely influential and prolific journalist and critic, he was an early supporter of the work of the artists Ingres, Delacroix, and Goya. Travel to Greece led to his collection of poems \u00c9maux et Cam\u00e9es (1852), in which he focused on artworks, following his ideas concerning transposition d\u2019art\u2014writing directly about art pieces.\n\r\nGautier joined Le Moniteur Universel in 1854 and became editor of L\u2019Artiste in 1856. In 1868, he became librarian to Princess Mathilde Bonaparte.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"]}}
