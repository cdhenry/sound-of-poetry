White", "yob": "1899", "yod": "1985", "image": null, "bio": "\nBorn in Mount Vernon, New York, children\u2019s writer and poet Elwyn Brooks White was the youngest of six children. He earned a BA at Cornell University. White wrote for the New Yorker and Harper\u2019s Magazine and published works of poetry and prose before trying his hand at writing for children.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhite\u2019s elegance, simplicity, and dry wit balance both his poetry and prose. Addressing a writer\u2019s need for self-discipline in a Paris Review interview with George Plimpton and Frank H. Crowther, White stated, \u201cThere are two faces to discipline. If a man [who writes] feels like going to a zoo, he should by all means go to a zoo.\u2026 The other face of discipline is that, zoo or no zoo, diversion or no diversion, in the end a man must sit down and get the words on paper, and against great odds.\u201d At White\u2019s memorial service, William Shawn, the New Yorker editor in chief celebrated White\u2019s achievement: \u201cHis literary style was as pure as any in our language. It was singular, colloquial, clear, unforced, thoroughly American and utterly beautiful.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhite published more than a dozen volumes of prose and poetry during his life. His poetry includes The Fox of Peapack, and Other Poems (1938), The Second Tree from the Corner (1954), and Poems and Sketches of E.B. White (1981). His books for children include Stuart Little (1945), Charlotte\u2019s Web (1952), and The Trumpet of the Swan (1970). His prose for adult readers includes One Man\u2019s Meat (1944), Here Is New York (1949), Letters of E.B. White (1976), and Essays of E.B. White (1977). He edited and updated several editions of William Strunk Jr.\u2019s The Elements of Style and co-authored Is Sex Necessary? Or, Why You Feel the Way You Do (1950) with James Thurber.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhite was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1973. His honors include the National Medal for Literature, a special Pulitzer award, and the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal. He moved with his wife to a farm in North Brooklin, Maine, in 1957, a setting that features prominently in his work. White died of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in 1985.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
