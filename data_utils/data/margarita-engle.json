On the impact Cuba has had in her writing, she says, \u201cFor more than three decades, official U.S. government travel restrictions made [travel to Cuba] impossible, so I used my imagination, remembering childhood visits, and wondering about the person I would be if that right to travel back and forth freely had not been taken away from me by a historical situation.\u201d\nEngle lives in central California and has taught agronomy at California State Polytechnic University.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
