He studied at Columbia University and Indiana University, and he was a Junior Fellow of the Society of Fellows of Harvard University. Hollander received numerous awards and fellowships, including the Levinson Prize, a MacArthur Foundation grant, and the poet laureateship of Connecticut. He served as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets, and he taught at Hunter College, Connecticut College, and Yale University, where he was the Sterling Professor emeritus of English.\nOver the course of an astonishing career, Hollander influenced generations of poets and thinkers with his critical work, his anthologies and his poetry. In the words of J.D. McClatchy, Hollander was \u201ca formidable presence in American literary life.\u201d Hollander\u2019s eminence as a scholar and critic was in some ways greater than his reputation as a poet. His groundbreaking introduction to form and prosody Rhyme\u2019s Reason (1981), as well as his work as an anthologist, has ensured him a place as one of the 20th-century\u2019s great, original literary critics. Hollander\u2019s critical writing is known for its extreme erudition and graceful touch. Hollander\u2019s poetry possesses many of the same qualities, though the wide range of allusion and technical virtuosity can make it seem \u201cdifficult\u201d to a general readership.\nHollander\u2019s first poetry collection, A Crackling of Thorns (1958) won the prestigious Yale Series of Younger Poets Awards, judged by W.H. Auden. And in fact James K. Robinson in the Southern Review found that Hollander\u2019s \u201cearly poetry resembles Auden\u2019s in its wit, its learned allusiveness, its prosodic mastery.\u201d Hollander\u2019s technique continued to develop through later books like Visions from the Ramble (1965) and The Night Mirror (1971). Broader in range and scope than his previous work, Hollander\u2019s Tales Told of the Fathers (1975) and Spectral Emanations (1978) heralded his arrival as a major force in contemporary poetry. Reviewing Spectral Emanations for the New Republic, Harold Bloom reflected on his changing impressions of the poet\u2019s work over the first 20 years of his career: \u201cI read [A Crackling of Thorns] \u2026 soon after I first met the poet, and was rather more impressed by the man than by the book. It has taken 20 years for the emotional complexity, spiritual anguish, and intellectual and moral power of the man to become the book. The enormous mastery of verse was there from the start, and is there still \u2026 But there seemed almost always to be more knowledge and insight within Hollander than the verse could accommodate.\u201d Bloom found in Spectral Emanations \u201canother poet as vital and accomplished as [A.R.] Ammons, [James] Merrill, [W.S.] Merwin, [John] Ashbery, James Wright, an immense augmentation to what is clearly a group of major poets.\u201d\nShortly after Spectral Emanations, Hollander published Blue Wine and Other Poems (1979), a volume which a number of critics have identified as an important milestone in Hollander\u2019s life and career. Reviewing the work for the New Leader, Phoebe Pettingell remarked, \u201cI would guess from the evidence of Blue Wine that John Hollander is now at the crossroads of his own midlife journey, picking out a new direction to follow.\u201d Hollander\u2019s new direction proved to be incredibly fruitful: his next books were unqualified successes. Powers of Thirteen (1983) won the Bollingen Prize from Yale University and In Time and Place (1986) was highly praised for its blend of verse and prose. In the Times Literary Supplement, Jay Parini believed \u201can elegiac tone dominates this book, which begins with a sequence of 34 poems in the In Memoriam stanza. These interconnecting lyrics are exquisite and moving, superior to almost anything else Hollander has ever written.\u201d Parini described the book as \u201ca landmark in contemporary poetry.\u201d McClatchy held up In Time and Place as evidence that Hollander is \u201cpart conjurer and part philosopher, one of our language\u2019s true mythographers and one of its very best poets.\u201d\nHollander continued to publish challenging, technically stunning verse throughout the 1980s and \u201990s. His Selected Poetry (1993) was released simultaneously with Tesserae (1993); Figurehead and Other Poems (1999) came a few years later. \u201cThe work collected in [Tesserae and Other Poems and Selected Poetry] makes clear that John Hollander is a considerable poet,\u201d New Republic reviewer Vernon Shetley remarked, \u201cbut it may leave readers wondering still, thirty-five years after his first book \u2026 exactly what kind of poet Hollander is.\u201d Shetley recognized the sheer variety of Hollander\u2019s work, but also noted the peculiar absence of anything like a personality, \u201cas if the poet had taken to heart, much more fully than its author, Eliot\u2019s dictum that poetry should embody \u2018emotion which has its life in the poem and not in the history of the poet.\u2019\u201d Another frequent charge leveled against Hollander\u2019s work is that it is \u201cphilosophical verse.\u201d Reviewing A Draft of Light (2008) for Jacket Magazine, Alex Lewis argued that instead of writing \u201cphilosophizing verse,\u201d Hollander actually \u201cborrows from philosophy a language and a way of thought. Hollander\u2019s poems are frequently meta-poems that create further meaning out of their own self-interrogations, out of their own reflexivity.\u201d As always, the poems are underpinned by an enormous amount of learning and incredible technical expertise and require \u201ca good deal of time and thought to unravel,\u201d Lewis admitted. But the rewards are great: \u201cthe book deepens every time that I read it,\u201d Lewis wrote, adding that Hollander\u2019s later years have given his work grandeur akin to Thomas Hardy and Wallace Stevens.\nHollander\u2019s work as a critic and anthologist has been widely praised from the start. As editor, he has worked on volumes of poets as diverse as Ben Jonson and Dante Gabriel Rossetti; his anthologist\u2019s credentials are impeccable. He was widely praised for the expansive American Poetry: The Nineteenth Century (1994), two volumes of verse including ballads, sonnets, epic poetry, and even folk songs. Herbert Mitgang of the New York Times praised the range of poets and authors included in the anthology: \u201cMr. Hollander has a large vision at work in these highly original volumes of verse. Without passing critical judgment, he allows the reader to savor not only the geniuses but also the second-rank writers of the era.\u201d Hollander also worked on the companion volume, American Poetry: The Twentieth Century (2000) with fellow poets and scholars Robert Hass, Carolyn Kizer, Nathaniel Mackey, and Marjorie Perloff.\nHollander\u2019s prose and criticism has been read and absorbed by generations of readers and writers. Perhaps his most lasting work is Rhyme\u2019s Reason. In an interview with Paul Devlin of St. John\u2019s University, Hollander described the impetus behind the volume: \u201cThinking of my own students, and of how there was no such guide to the varieties of verse in English to which I could send them and that would help teach them to notice things about the examples presented\u2014to see how the particular stanza or rhythmic scheme or whatever was being used by the particular words of the particular poem, for example\u2014I got to work and with a speed which now alarms me produced a manuscript for the first edition of the book. I\u2019ve never had more immediate fun writing a book.\u201d Hollander\u2019s other works of criticism include The Work of Poetry (1993), The Poetry of Everyday Life (1997), and Poetry and Music (2003).\nHollander died on August 17, 2013 in Brandford, Connecticut.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
