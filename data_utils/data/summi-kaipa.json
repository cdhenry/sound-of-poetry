She also edited, with Neelanjana Banerjee and Pireeni Sundaralingam, the anthology Indivisible: An Anthology of Contemporary South Asian American Poetry (2010). Kaipa described the poems in the anthology as \u201cabout what it means for these authors to be American: to grapple with the American dream, to grow up with [Billie] Holliday, to exist in the multicultural community of America, and to be targets of ethnic stereotyping and violence, especially after Sept. 11.\u201d \u00a0 Kaipa has served on the board of the Alliance of Emerging Creative Artists and New Langton Arts. She lives in Berkeley, California.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
