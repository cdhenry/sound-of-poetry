She has published several collections of poetry, including Captivity (2007); The Willow Grove (1996), a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize; and Amaranth (1981). Her poems often use myths as frames within which to explore ideas of motion and stillness, consciousness and the body. In a 2002 interview, speaking to the attentiveness, rather than narrative, that drives her work, Sheck noted, \u201cif you create a world on the page in which things that seem not to hold together can interact with each other, they can hold, and part of what\u2019s holding, part of what\u2019s interesting, is the way that things don\u2019t directly hook up.\u201dHer 500-page hybrid novel, A Monster\u2019s Notes (2009), uses prose fragments and deletions, letters, and embedded texts to reimagine the monster in Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein. \u201cAs Sheck demonstrates, the lyric essay is a kind of Frankenstein's monster, equipped with parts sliced out of others, stitched up with genius and white space,\u201d observes novelist and editor Ed Park in a review for the Los Angeles Times.Sheck\u2019s honors include fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Ingram Merrill Foundation, the New Jersey State Council for the Arts, and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Her poems have won several Pushcart Prizes and have been included in Best American Poetry. Sheck edited the anthology Poem a Day, Volume 2 (2003).Sheck has taught at Princeton University and the New School. She lives in New York City.\n", "attrs": {}}
