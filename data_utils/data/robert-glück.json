He was educated at the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Edinburgh, the College of Art in Edinburgh, and the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a BA. He also studied writing in New York City workshops with poet Ted Berrigan and earned an MA at San Francisco State University.\nWith Bruce Boone and other writers, Gl\u00fcck co-founded the New Narrative movement in San Francisco in the early 1980s. Gl\u00fcck\u2019s experimental work\u2014typically prose\u2014infuses L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E theory with queer, feminist, and class-based discourse while exploring issues of autobiography and self. In his essay \u201cLong Note on New Narrative,\u201d which appeared in Biting the Error: Writers Explore Narrative (2004), Gl\u00fcck stated, \u201cWe were thinking about autobiography; by autobiography we meant daydreams, nightdreams, the act of writing, the relationship to the reader, the meeting of flesh and culture, the self as collaboration, the self as disintegration, the gaps, inconsistencies and distortions, the enjambments of power, family, history and language.\u201d\nGl\u00fcck\u2019s poetry includes the collection Reader (1989) and, with Boone, the collaboration La Fontaine (1981). His fiction includes the story collection Denny Smith (2003) and the novels Jack the Modernist (1995) and Margery Kempe (1994). Gl\u00fcck\u2019s work has been selected for numerous anthologies, including Lust for Life: On the Writings of Kathy Acker (2006), Best American Erotica 2005, and The Faber Book of Gay Short Fiction (1992). In 2016, Semiotext(e) published his collected essays, Communal Nude. He has received a California Arts Council Fellowship and a San Francisco Arts Commission Cultural Equity Grant.\nGl\u00fcck has served as director of San Francisco State\u2019s Poetry Center, codirector of the Small Press Traffic Literary Center, and editor for Lapis Press and the literary journal Narrativity. He lives in San Francisco.\n\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
