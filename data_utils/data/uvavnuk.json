This experience made her clairvoyant and marked the start of her life as a shaman. After being struck, she is said to have returned home singing a song-poem, which has since been widely anthologized; Jane Hirschfield included it in Women in Praise of the Sacred: 43 Centuries of Spiritual Poetry by Women (1994). Uvavnuk is thought to have used her power to bring good fortune to her people, even after her death.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {}}
