He is the author of the poetry collections Shapeshift (2003) and Flood Song (2009).\r\n\u00a0\r\nSteeped in Native American culture, mythology, and history, Bitsui\u2019s poems reveal the tensions in the intersection of Native American and contemporary urban culture. His poems are imagistic, surreal, and rich with details of the landscape of the Southwest. Flood Song is a book-length lyric sequence that explores the traditions of Native American writing through postmodern fragment and stream of consciousness.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBitsui has received a Whiting Writers\u2019 Award, a grant from the Witter Bynner Foundation for Poetry, a Truman Capote Creative Writing Fellowship, and a Lannan Literary Fellowship. He teaches at the Institute of American Indian Arts.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
