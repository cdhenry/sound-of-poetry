In his poems, in which he occasionally invents formal constraints, Hayes considers themes of popular culture, race, music, and masculinity. \u201cHayes\u2019s fourth book puts invincibly restless wordplay at the service of strong emotions: a son\u2019s frustration, a husband\u2019s love, a citizen\u2019s righteous anger and a friend\u2019s erotic jealousy animate these technically astute, even puzzlelike, lines,\u201d observed Stephanie Burt in a 2010 review of Lighthead for the New York Times. In a 2013 interview with Lauren Russell for Hot Metal Bridge, Hayes stated, \u201cI\u2019m chasing a kind of language that can be unburdened by people\u2019s expectations. I think music is the primary model\u2014how close can you get this language to be like music and communicate feeling at the base level in the same way a composition with no words communicates meaning? It might be impossible. Language is always burdened by thought. I\u2019m just trying to get it so it can be like feeling.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nHayes\u2019s poetry collections include American Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin\u00a0(2018), finalist for the National Book Award; How to Be Drawn\u00a0(2015), finalist for the National Book Award and the National Books Critics Circle Award;\u00a0Lighthead\u00a0(2010), winner of the National Book Award and finalist for a National Book Critics Circle Award;\u00a0Wind in a Box\u00a0(2006), finalist for the Hurston-Wright Legacy Award;\u00a0Hip Logic\u00a0(2002), chosen for the National Poetry Series and finalist for an\u00a0LA Times\u00a0Book Award and an Academy of American Poets James Laughlin Award;\u00a0and Muscular Music\u00a0(1999), winner of a Kate Tufts Discovery Award.\u00a0His poems have also been featured in several editions of Best American Poetry and have won multiple Pushcart Prizes. He is also the author of a prose book based on his Bagley Wright lectures: To Float in the Space Between: A Life and Work in Conversation with the Life and Work of Etheridge Knight (Wave Books, 2018), which was winner of the Poetry Foundation's 2019 Pegasus Award in Poetry Criticism.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHayes\u2019s additional honors include a Whiting Writers\u2019 Award and fellowships from the MacArthur Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Guggenheim Foundation. He has taught at Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Alabama, and the University of Pittsburgh.
