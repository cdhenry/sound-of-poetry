She is the author of the full-length poetry collections Primate Behavior (Grove Press, 1997), which was a finalist for the National Book Award, Mount Clutter (Grove Press, 2002), Twigs and Knucklebones (Copper Canyon Press, 2008), and Debt to the Bone-Eating Snotflower (Copper Canyon Press, 2013).\nLindsay\u2019s work is known for its lyricism and deft inclusion of scientific facts, theories, and methods. In an interview with Guernica, Lindsay described her research as \u201ccontinual, because I feel the need to read continually. When a peculiar fact or well-stated bit of information triggers a poem, most of what I\u2019ll need is there where I stumbled on it. If questions arise later (moons of Jupiter, a three-syllable squid), Google is awfully handy of course, but sometimes books are still better, and we have lots.\u201d\nHer honors and awards include a Pushcart Prize, the Carolyn Kizer Prize, and J. Howard and Barbara M.J. Wood Prize as well as a Lannan Literary Fellowship. She lives in Greensboro, North Carolina, where she works as a copy editor.\n", "attrs": {}}
