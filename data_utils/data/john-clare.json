With an admiration of nature and an understanding of the oral tradition, but with little formal education, Clare penned numerous poems and prose pieces, many of which were only published posthumously. His works gorgeously illuminate the natural world and rural life, and depict his love for his wife Patty and for his childhood sweetheart Mary Joyce. Though his first book, Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery (1820), was popular with readers and critics alike, Clare struggled professionally for much of his life. His work only became widely read some hundred years after his death.\nClare was born into a peasant family in the small English village of Helpston in 1793. Despite his disadvantaged background\u2014both of his parents were virtually illiterate\u2014Clare did receive some formal schooling as a youth. He attended a day school for a few months every year until he was about twelve years old, and then he went to night school, studied informally with other boys in the area, and read in his spare time. Clare\u2019s favorite books included Daniel Defoe\u2019s Robinson Crusoe and Izaak Walton\u2019s The Compleat Angler. During his school days Clare met fellow student Mary Joyce and embarked upon a romantic relationship with her. Although the two eventually separated and Clare married Patty Turner, Clare would devote much of his later poetry to Mary.\n\r\nAlthough Clare had received some education, the work he did out of financial necessity consisted largely of manual labor such as gardening, ploughing, threshing, or lime-burning. Meanwhile, he began to write poetry. Clare was inspired to write his first poem, \u201cThe Morning Walk,\u201d after reading James Thompson\u2019s Seasons. As Clare began to write more, his parents unwittingly became his first critics. In order to ensure an honest, objective assessment, Clare would read his poetry to his parents as if it had been written by another author, keeping what they liked and scrapping what they didn\u2019t. He soon accumulated a substantial poetry collection, which was published in 1820 by John Taylor (who also published the work of John Keats) as Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery.\n\nRural Life ranges over a variety of topics and themes, including nature, folk literature, social injustice, and the world of the mind, and it includes a number of poetic forms, such as descriptive verse, elegies, sonnets, and comic poems. In his introduction to the volume, Taylor defended Clare\u2019s imitations of other poets (including Robert Burns), his heavy use of dialect, and his occasionally incorrect grammar. Attributing these aspects of Clare\u2019s work to his youth and disadvantaged background, Taylor asserted, \u201cClare\u2026 does not regard language in the same way that a logician does. He considers it collectively rather than in detail, and paints up to his mind\u2019s original by mingling words, as a painter mixes his colours.\u201d\n\nRural Life was a success, selling three thousand copies and going through four editions within a year. It was generally well reviewed. A Quarterly Review critic, for instance, found Clare to have \u201can animation, a vivacity, and a delicacy in describing rural scenery.\u201d An example of Clare\u2019s descriptive powers appears in the poem \u201cNoon\u201d: \u201cAll how silent and how still / Nothing heard but yonder mill; / While the dazzled eye surveys / All around a liquid blaze; / And amid the scorching gleams, / If we earnest look, it seems / As if crooked bits of glass / Seem\u2019d repeatedly to pass.\u201d\n\r\nClare\u2019s attempts at comedy, however, were considered by contemporary critics to be vulgar or objectionable. An example is Clare\u2019s \u201cMy Mary,\u201d a parody of William Cowper\u2018s poem \u201cMary\u201d: \u201cWho, save in Sunday\u2019s bib and tuck, / Goes daily waddling like a duck, / O\u2019er head and ears in grease and muck? / My Mary.\u201d The poem was eliminated from later editions of Rural Life\u2014an incident that was representative of a problem that would continue to occur throughout Clare\u2019s career. According to Howard, \u201cthe audience that could afford to support him through the purchase of his books was not the audience that could understand the blend of country experience and literary allusion that he was providing.\u201d\n\r\nThe success of Rural Life brought Clare recognition and the assistance of several benefactors. He visited London that year, attending plays and dinner parties and hobnobbing with literary luminaries. Clare also married Patty Turner, who was already several months pregnant with their first child. Although the pressures of fame and family slowed his production somewhat, Clare soon published another collection, The Village Minstrel, and Other Poems (1821). Though The Village Minstrel includes a variety of poetic styles similar to those in Rural Life, the themes of the volume are more limited. Clare focuses on \u201cthe value of country sports and customs,\u201d according to Howard, although other topics include the consequences of enclosing lands that were once commonly owned and the plight of the gypsies. In \u201cThe Gipsy\u2019s Camp\u201d Clare wrote: \u201cMy rambles led me to a gipsy\u2019s camp, / Where the real effigy of midnight hags, / With tawny smoked flesh and tatter\u2019d rags, / Uncouth-brimm\u2019d hat, and weather-beaten cloak, / \u2018Neath the wild shelter of a knotty oak, / Along the greensward uniformly pricks / Her pliant bending hazel\u2019s arching sticks.\u201d\n\r\nWith The Village Minstrel Clare was on his way to creating a more distinctive style. Howard noted that the sonnet \u201cSummer Tints\u201d \u201cincludes a good example of Clare\u2019s maturing descriptive powers\u201d: \u201cHow sweet I\u2019ve wandered bosom-deep in grain, / When Summer\u2019s mellowing pencil sweeps his / shade / Of ripening tinges o\u2019er the chequer\u2019d plain: / Light tawny oat-lands with a yellow blade; / And bearded corn, like armies on parade.\u201d Although The Village Minstrel did not enjoy the wide success of Rural Life, the book sold respectably and the critical reception was generally favorable, with many reviewers praising Clare\u2019s development as a poet. Clare garnered acclaim for his depictions of rural life and, according to Howard, a Literary Gazette reviewer believed that \u201cseveral of the poems\u2026 will raise the reputation of the rustic bard above his former fame.\u201d\n\r\nClare\u2019s next major effort to be published was The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar (1827). Though the poet derived the idea for the book from the work of Edmund Spenser, Howard noted that \u201chis eventual treatment of Spenser\u2019s idea goes beyond imitation to the creation of a new, contemporary version of pastoral, rooted in the soil of English\u2026 country life.\u201d In the first section of The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar Clare devises a poem for each month of the year, offering a celebration of rural life with a shepherd figuring throughout. Other pieces include \u201cPoesy\u201d and \u201cThe Dream,\u201d a darkly written description of a nightmare. The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar did not garner the critical attention or public interest that Clare\u2019s earlier work did: critics were divided regarding the merits of the collection. According to Howard, a London Weekly Review critic referred to \u201cThe Dream\u201c as an \u201cabsurd piece of doggrel and bombast,\u201d whereas a Literary Chronicle reviewer found the same poem to \u201cpossess\u2026 an almost Byronic strength and originality.\u201d The collection was praised by Eclectic Review editor Josiah Conder, however, who asserted that the book \u201cexhibits very unequivocal signs of intellectual growth, an improved taste, and an enriched mind.\u201d\n\r\nAlthough Clare had to contend with physical and mental illness in the years following the publication of The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar, he was able to recover sufficiently to produce The Rural Muse, which was published in 1835. The Rural Muse includes songs, sonnets, and autobiographical poems. Though Howard considered some of the pieces \u201cdisappointing,\u201d he noted that others \u201cdemonstrate just how far Clare had progressed in his craft.\u201d Howard praised the originality of \u201cAutumn,\u201d in which Clare describes the changing of the seasons: \u201cThy pencil dashing its excess of shades, / Improvident of waste, till every bough / Burns with thy mellow touch / Disorderly divine.\u201d With The Rural Muse critical and public interest in Clare\u2019s work continued to dwindle. The attention that the book did bring, however, was generally quite positive. A New Monthly Magazine reviewer stated that Clare had demonstrated \u201ca far superior finish, and a much greater command over the resources of language and metre\u201d than he had in his earlier work. In Howard\u2019s opinion, Clare\u2019s editors excluded many of the poet\u2019s best pieces from The Rural Muse. \u201cClare\u2019s reputation might, in fact, have been more enhanced by this volume had it included more of those sonnets which Clare had originally proposed for it.\u201d\n\nThe Rural Muse was the last major collection published in Clare\u2019s lifetime. He continued to write, but his mental and physical health weakened during the late 1830s and his doctor recommended that he recuperate in an asylum. In 1836 Clare was admitted to High Beech asylum, where he was allowed considerable freedom to write poetry and stroll the grounds. The poet missed his family, however, and soon became dissatisfied with this situation. In 1841 Clare walked away from the asylum and continued to walk until he reached his home four days later. His stay was relatively brief, though, since he was becoming increasingly difficult for Patty to manage. Clare was admitted to Northampton Lunatic Asylum\u2014where he was to spend the rest of his life\u2014five months after he left High Beech.\n\r\nDuring this period, Clare \u201chad begun to live in the mind and seemed to have a confused idea of himself, a confusion which mixes strangely and revealingly with a scrupulously unself-pitying clarity of description,\u201d according to Dictionary of Literary Biography contributor R. K. R. Thornton. Clare\u2019s asylum poetry includes \u201cDon Juan\u201d and \u201cChild Harold,\u201d which were derived from the work of Lord Byron. \u201cDon Juan,\u201d written in what Howard termed \u201cearthy\u201d language, is a \u201crambling discourse on sexuality, morality, and politics.\u201d \u201cChild Harold\u201d concerns the character of poets and love, and much of the work addresses Mary Joyce, with Patty relegated to the status of \u201cother\u201d wife. Howard considered \u201cChild Harold\u201d to be \u201cunmistakably Clare\u2019s most original work.\u201d\n\r\nMany of Clare\u2019s other poems of this period are traditional love verses and songs written to various women, especially Mary Joyce. The poet still created original work, however. Howard cites \u201cA Favourite Place\u201d as one of Clare\u2019s \u201cimpressive array of original lyrics\u201d: \u201cBeautiful gravel walks overgrown / with moss & grass little places where / the poet sat to write.\u201d Some of Clare\u2019s later work, according to Howard, offers \u201cmomentary glimpses into Clare\u2019s mind that reveal his continuing delusions but also something of the anguish that resulted from his partial sanity.\u201d One of Clare\u2019s letters, written in 1860, reads: \u201cDear Sir, I am in a Madhouse & quite forget your Name or who you are you must excuse me for I have nothing to communicate or tell of & why I am shut up I dont know I have nothing to say so I conclude yours respectfully John Clare.\u201d\n\r\nAfter more than twenty years at Northampton, Clare died in 1864. New editions and previously unpublished collections of his work continued to be released after his death. The more recent editions of Clare\u2019s work, including Eric Robinson and Geoffrey Summerfield\u2019s editions of The Later Poems of John Clare and The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar, have reinstated Clare\u2019s idiosyncrasies in language, spelling, and punctuation, which were \u201ccorrected\u201d by his editors in early versions. Clare\u2019s opinion of the rules of grammar was quoted by Thornton: \u201cdo I write intelligable I am generally understood tho I do not use that awkward squad of pointings called commas colons semicolons &c & for the very reason that altho they are drilled hourly daily weekly by every boarding school Miss who pretends to gossip in correspondence they do not know their proper exercise for they even set grammarians at loggerheads and no one can asign them their proper places.\u201d\n\r\nClare\u2019s work continues to attract readers, poets, and scholars. In the 20th century, poets especially rediscovered Clare: John Ashbery wrote both a poem to Clare, \u201cFor John Clare,\u201d and wrote about him in his book Other Traditions (2000). And scholars now recognize Clare as an important poet and prose writer. \u201cAs an observer of what it was like in England in the early nineteenth century, not only for the peasant but also from a peasant point of view, he is irreplaceable,\u201d declared Thornton. In Clare\u2019s prose, Thornton concluded, \u201cwe\u2026 see reflected there in sharp clarity the very essence of a period, a place, a language, a culture, and a time.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Romantic"]}}
