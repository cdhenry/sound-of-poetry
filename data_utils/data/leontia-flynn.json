In a 2008 review of Drives for The Guardian, Frances Leviston praises the \u201ccurrents of difficult feeling, beneath the wise, glittering fronts of her poems.\u201d In a 2011 interview with J.P. O\u2019Malley for Culture Northern Ireland, Flynn states, \u201cI think in poetry you go a funny way around the houses to get your meaning across. I do tend to make noises and sound effects sometimes, rather than use words. Poetry is always aware of this non-linguistic other part of itself.\u201d Flynn is the author of several full-length collections of poetry, including Profit and Loss (2011), Drives (2008), and These Days (2004), which won the Forward Prize (Best Poetry Collection of the Year) and was shortlisted for the Whitbread Award. She has also been awarded the Eric Gregory Award and the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature. \u00a0 Flynn lives in Belfast.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Ireland & Northern Ireland"]}}
