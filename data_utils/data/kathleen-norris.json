Kathleen Norris began her literary career as a poet, but it was her spiritual memoirs such as Amazing Grace (1998), The Cloister Walk (1996),\u00a0and\u00a0Dakota: A Spiritual Geography (1993)\u00a0that brought her to the attention of the general reading public. In these books, Norris ruminates on her religious upbringing, the doubts that assailed her as she reached maturity, and her continuing examination of the conflicts within her. Norris, a married Protestant woman, found an apparently unlikely source for spiritual peace at a Catholic monastery near her home. Eventually, she took layman\u2019s vows at this monastery. In\u00a0The Cloister Walk\u00a0and other writings, she sheds light on monastic life, the value of celibacy, and the need for religion in the modern world. Critics find her books appealing because they are written in accessible language, and because they express doubt and an ongoing sense of conflict.\nShe was a bookish and sheltered student, stunned by the hedonistic excesses common at Bennington in that era. Her memoir\u00a0The Virgin of Bennington (2001)\u00a0recalls those years and draws its title from the mocking nickname given her by her fellow students. The shy young woman protected herself by turning inward and immersing herself in poetry. Eventually she was caught up in the culture around her, however, and by the end of her studies there she had embarked on an affair with a married professor who was instrumental in finding her a job in New York City after her graduation in 1969.\nIn New York, Norris associated with Andy Warhol and his crowd, and also worked as an assistant to Betty Kray, an arts administrator employed by the American Academy of Poets. In\u00a0The Virgin of Bennington,\u00a0she sketches out these memorable, often disturbing years, and relates how in 1974, she and her future husband left New York to travel to Lemmon, South Dakota after her grandmother\u2019s death. Expecting only a short stay, they instead settled there permanently.\nNorris had already published a first book of poems,\u00a0Falling Off (1971),\u00a0which was the winner of the Big Table Younger Poets series. That book features what Paul Carroll, a critic in\u00a0Choice,\u00a0called \u201cangelism,\u201d with subjects that include the Port Authority bus terminal in New York City, and literary influences that include\u00a0W.S. Merwin,\u00a0James Tate,\u00a0Stevie Smith, and\u00a0Pablo Neruda. A prescient review in the\u00a0Hudson Review\u00a0alerted readers that \u201cKathleen Norris has enough wit and ease to be worth attention: let her drop all reference to angels and find something she cares to write about.\u201d Similarly, author A.G. Mojtabai, reviewing\u00a0Falling Off\u00a0in\u00a0Library Journal,\u00a0praised Norris\u2019s \u201csuperbly wry\u201d manner and called her \u201ca spellbinder, a poet to watch.\u201d\nExcept for a small volume of four illustrated poems, however,\u00a0Falling Off\u00a0was to be Norris\u2019s last collection for ten years. In 1981 her\u00a0next book, The Middle of the World, was published by the University of Pittsburgh Press. Showing the positive effects of several years of hard work (both mental and physical) on the Plains, the volume dealt with a theme that the\u00a0Virginia Quarterly Review\u00a0expressed as that of being centered, physically and emotionally, in time and space, of being at the midpoint. The reviewer liked Norris\u2019s \u201cstrongly narrative, easily accessible\u201d poems.\u00a0Library Journal\u00a0reviewer Laurie Brown declared that \u201cwhen Norris succeeds, she\u2019s worth remembering.\u201d A chapbook,\u00a0The Year of Common Things (1988),\u00a0followed.\u00a0Prairie Schooner\u00a0reviewer Stephen C. Behrendt labeled it \u201cstriking,\u201d calling attention to the Wordsworthian influence on the poems. Behrendt praised the poet\u2019s \u201cbroad humanity\u201d and \u201ckeen eye for particularizing local detail\u201d; he noted, too, the difficulty of crafting apparently simple poems in a relaxed, conversational tone and idiom discussing ordinary people and events. \u201cFrom the fabric of the familiar in language and experience alike, Norris evokes the intensely personal responses of her characters and speakers,\u201d commented Behrendt.\nNorris\u2019s next full-length volume of poems was titled\u00a0Little Girls in Church (1995).\u00a0Kliatt\u00a0reviewer James Beschta stated that the book\u2019s title is \u201cunusually accurate,\u201d since the work is dominated by religious and female themes. The book does more, Beschta asserted, than simply bind life with religion: the major theme of the poetry is \u201cthe blending of life and death and love.\u201d\u00a0Belles Lettres\u2019s Geraldine C. Little was even more enthusiastic, welcoming the author of\u00a0Little Girls in Church\u00a0as \u201ca poet who with wit, sharp intelligence, joy, and an all-seeing eye [who] praises life from the ordinary to the sublime.\u201d\nNorris had, at that point, gained public recognition with her first nonfiction book,\u00a0Dakota: A Spiritual Geography (1993).\u00a0In the tradition of Annie Dillard and Gretel Ehrlich, Norris finds in the land\u2014in this case, the farmland of the Great Plains\u2014the inspiration for religious musings and personal renewal. In the book, Norris tells of how life on the Plains\u2014which she called \u201ca crucible\u201d\u2014has changed her: \u201cLike Jacob\u2019s angel, the region requires that you wrestle with it before it bestows a blessing.\u201d Norris tells of the ordinary social lives and gossip of her neighbors; of the drastically changing weather through the seasons; of her experiences as temporary pastor of a Presbyterian church with only 25 members; and of her many contacts with the monks in the local Benedictine abbey, whom she increasingly appreciated for their \u201ccontemplative sense of fun\u201d and for their commitment to celibacy, which\u2014like a commitment to marriage, she felt\u2014left them secure enough to be free.\nCritical response to\u00a0Dakota\u00a0was overwhelming, and the book, which had only a 8,500-copy first printing, sold more than one-hundred-thousand copies in hardcover, according to a\u00a0Booklist\u00a0interview with Norris. A reviewer in\u00a0Bloomsbury Review\u00a0commented, \u201cFor a deeper understanding of the Plains, for exquisite poetic descriptions, and most importantly, for an alternative vision of life,\u00a0Dakota\u00a0is invaluable. Norris\u2019s gentle desert wisdom has the potential to restore lost dimensions of our humanity, to return us to our roots, and to offer possible alternatives to our alienation.\u201d\u00a0Commonweal\u00a0reviewer Elizabeth Bartelme called\u00a0Dakota\u00a0\u201ca poet\u2019s book; a work of beauty; a testament to the work of the Spirit.\u201d\nCritical response arose in much the same key for Norris\u2019s followup volume,\u00a0The Cloister Walk (1996).\u00a0This book focuses more intensely on the side of Norris\u2019s life that touches organized religion and monasticism. She had recently spent two nine-month periods at the Institute for Ecumenical and Cultural Research at St. John\u2019s Abbey and University, a Benedictine institution in Collegeville, Minnesota. As an oblate, or layperson who took limited monastic vows in harmony with her worldly and marital life, she \u201cwalked\u201d with the monks without being precisely one of them. In the process, she became more deeply familiar with and appreciative of Roman Catholic theology and practices. The book, which contained seventy-five meditations, deals with such subjects as the connection between religion and poetry, the meaning of certain Catholic feasts, the lives of inspirational figures of the past, and the value of the celibate life. On the subject of celibacy more than one critic noted that Norris is especially insightful. She views celibacy as a lifelong conversation process leading to spiritual and emotional maturity: as Nancy M. Malone, writing in\u00a0America,\u00a0stated, \u201cshe talks of celibacy as a form of service to others, as expressive of the essential loneliness of life\u00a0 ... necessary for all of us at one time or another.\u201d\nEven married people, Norris observed, often undertake de facto periods of celibacy during personal crises or at other crucial times. Drawing on her personal experiences, Norris, Malone claimed, offers insights that save the book from being a self-indulgent memoir, as is typical of the genre. \u201cThe author learns something from her experience, and so do we.\u201d Concluded Malone, \u201cThe Cloister Walk\u00a0is often just plain funny. ... It is beautifully written\u00a0 ... in giving us life closely observed and accurately expressed. Norris\u00a0 ... has something significant to say.\u201d\nNorris has also continued her work as a poet, and in 2001 a collection was published as\u00a0Journey: New and Selected Poems, 1969-1999.\u00a0The book won praise for being \u201cwitty and graceful\u201d as well as \u201csupple and inventive,\u201d in the estimation of\u00a0Booklist\u00a0reviewer Donna Seaman. Critic Paul Mariani also praised the collection, especially the later work which shows people in a \u201ccompassionate light, often with humor, always with insight.\u201d\nNorris lives in Hawaii.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
