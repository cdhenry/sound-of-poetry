He then moved to Paris, France, where he earned a doctorate d\u2019universite from the Sorbonne. A writer of compact and precise poems, Menashe was highly regarded among critics. His first American volume, No Jerusalem But This (1971), was praised by Stephen Spender\u00a0for \u201clanguage intense and clear as diamonds.\u201d Spender declared that Menashe \u201ccan compress an attitude to life that has an immense history into three lines.\u201d\nTo Open, Menashe\u2019s 1974 collection, impressed Christian Science Monitor critic Victor Howes with its concentrated works. \u201cThe art of Samuel Menashe is a jeweler\u2019s art,\u201d Howes claimed. He noted that Menashe\u2019s \u201cinner rhymes, his assonances, his occasional plays upon words make even the simplest-seeming statement a construct to read again with heightened attention.\u201d\nAlthough Menashe published only a few volumes, he was considered a unique and significant poet by critics such as Donald Davie and Hugh Kenner. In National Review Kenner praised Menashe\u2019s \u201ctaut energies,\u201d and in an Inquiry review of Davie\u2019s The Poet in the Imaginary Museum, Kenner focused almost entirely on Davie\u2019s elucidation of Menashe\u2019s art. In \u201cThe Poetry of Samuel Menashe,\u201d Davie linked Menashe to William Blake\u00a0and wrote, \u201cIf we continue to ignore Menashe, or allow him only the abstracted nod that we give to an unclassifiable oddity, we are in effect saying that he doesn\u2019t deserve to profit by the promise that Blake made.\u201d\nMenashe was the winner of the first Neglected Masters Award, given by the Poetry Foundation. His New and Selected Poems (2005) was published in conjunction with that honor by the Library of America, edited by Christopher Ricks. Menashe lived in New York City for many decades until his death on August 22, 2011.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
