She has published several collections of poetry, including Post and Rail (2018),\u00a0Earthly (2008), Pursuit (2002), and Affinities (1983). In a review of Earthly, Publishers Weekly praised her as \u201ca poet of observation, one who looks steadily, patiently, and respectfully at the things, both built and natural, of this world.\u201d Utilizing both free verse and formal constraint, Funkhouser engages her subjects with a quiet, precise lyricism.\n\u201cI think I don\u2019t really know who I am, or what I think, or what I believe unless I\u2019m in the process of writing,\u201d she said in a 2007 interview with the Boston Globe. \u201cThat\u2019s where all of my discovery takes place, that\u2019s where all of my confrontation takes place\u2014I would say not just with my own interior life but with the exterior life, the rest of the world.\u201d Funkhouser has been honored as a Literary Light by the Boston Public Library and has also received a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation.\u00a0She teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and lives in Essex, Massachusetts.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
