She has received a \u201cDiscovery\u201d/The Nation prize, a Bread Loaf scholarship and a Lannan Foundation Writing Residency. Her collection for children, Barefoot: Poems for Naked Feet, was published by Wordsong in 2008. With degrees in physics, Weisburd has been a Congressional policy analyst, a science writer and an outreach coordinator for a nanoscience program at the University of New Mexico. \r As Charles Harper Webb explains, Weisburd\u2019s scientific background informs her poetry: \u201cWelcome to the world of The Wind-Up Gods, where Newtonian Girl struggles to maintain a few clockwork certainties in the face of quantum anarchy, and Stefi Weisburd finds post-Heisenberg salvation through irony, imagination, and the vivid language of these wild, brainy, and visceral poems.\u201d\n                                                            ", "attrs": {}}
