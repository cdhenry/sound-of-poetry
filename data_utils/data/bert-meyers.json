He grew up in East Hollywood and left high school to become a master picture framer and gilder. Though he did not attend college, Meyers was admitted to the Claremont Graduate School based on the strength of his poetry and earned a PhD.  \u00a0 Meyers\u2019s precisely framed poems are frequently image driven and often quite short. Noting that \u201cthe image is unequivocally at the center of his work\u201d in her introduction to In a Dybbuk\u2019s Raincoat, poet Denise Levertov praised Meyers\u2019s work for the \u201cextraordinary intensity and perfection of his poems and the consistency with which he illumined what he experienced, bodying it forth in images that enable readers to share his vision and thereby extend the boundaries of their own lives.\u201d \u00a0 During his lifetime, Meyers published the collections Early Rain (1960), The Dark Birds (1968), Sunlight on the Wall (1976), Windowsills (1979), and The Wild Olive Trees (1979). Before he died, he selected and arranged the core poems of In a Dybbuk\u2019s Raincoat: Collected Poems (2007). His widow, Odette Meyers, son Daniel Meyers, and friend Morton Marcus shepherded the book into publication, expanding Meyers\u2019s original selection into his collected works by adding more poems, songs, articles, and testimonies to the work Meyers had originally chosen. \u00a0 Meyers taught at Pitzer College, which dedicated the Bert Meyers Poetry Room inside the historic Grove House in the poet\u2019s honor.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
