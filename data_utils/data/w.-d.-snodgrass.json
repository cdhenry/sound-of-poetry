Snodgrass was born in Pennsylvania, and after serving as a typist in the US Navy in World War II, earned a BA and MA at the University of Iowa. At Iowa he studied under poet Robert Lowell, who came to greatly admire Snodgrass's poetry and helped find a publisher for Snodgrass's first collection of poetry, Heart's Needle (1959). This highly autobiographical first book\u2014which sensitively chronicles the loss of his daughter in a divorce\u2014won the Pulitzer Prize in poetry, and it is considered to signal the beginning of the Confessional mode of poetry, and it would influence such poets as Sylvia Plath, Ted Hughes, and his teachers Lowell and John Berryman. He authored more than 30 books of poetry, criticism, and translations, while teaching at several colleges for 40 years.\nSnodgrass was considered one of the central figures of the Confessional mode, even though he disliked the term and did not regard his work as such. \u201cLike other confessional poets, Snodgrass is at pains to reveal the repressed, violent feelings that often lurk beneath the seemingly placid surface of everyday life,\u201d David McDuff observes in Stand. The style was imitated and, in some cases, surpassed by other poets. This fact leads Yale Review\u2019s Laurence Lieberman to comment that a later book, After Experience (1967), reveals \u201can artist trapped in a style which ... has reached a dead end,\u201d because other poets had taken the Confessional mode in a different direction than Snodgrass\u2019s own. However, later works by Snodgrass show him widening his vision to apply the lessons of self-examination to the problems of 20th-century Western culture. His poems also present, beyond the direct-statement and sentimentality common to confessional poetry, an inclusiveness of detail and variety of technique aimed to impact the reader\u2019s subconscious as well as conscious mind.\n\r\nThe combination of the traditional and the confessional in Snodgrass\u2019s writing prompted Thomas Lask of the New York Times to write, \u201cIn Heart\u2019s Needle ... Snodgrass spoke in a distinctive voice. It was one that was jaunty and assertive on the surface but somber and hurt beneath. ... It is one of the few books that successfully bridged the directness of contemporary free verse with the demands of the academy.\u201d Peter Porter echoes this opinion when he writes in London Magazine: \u201cSnodgrass is a virtuoso, not just of versification but of his feelings. He sends them round the loops of self analysis with the same skill he uses to corset them into his poetry.\u201d The impact of Snodgrass\u2019s self-analytical approach is clearly felt in Stanley Moss\u2019s statement in the New Republic that the poet \u201chas found a place for emotions felt, but previously left without words and out of consciousness. He has identified himself with exquisite suffering and guilt and with all those who barely manage to exist on the edge of life.\u201d\n\r\nSnodgrass also worked as a translator and published several books of translations. Regarding his translation (with Lore Segal) of Christian Morgenstern\u2019s Gallows Songs, Louise Bogan wrote in the New Yorker: \u201cGerman ... here takes on a demonic life of its own. ... To translate Morgenstern is a very nearly impossible task, to which the present translators have faced up bravely and well.\u201d Even though some critics may not agree with Bogan\u2014poet and critic Hayden Carruth called the translation \u201cdreadful\u201d\u2014Books Abroad\u2019s Sidney Rosenfeld finds that in spite of its possible shortcomings, Gallows Songs opens \u201ca door onto the world of Christian Morgenstern and impart[s] to the English reader some sense of the playfully profound genius that enlivens it.\u201d\n\r\nCritic Paul Gaston contended that Snodgrass\u2019s critical essays and translations helped develop his talents and prevented him from reaching the complete dead end of Lieberman\u2019s prediction. \u201cThese endeavors,\u201d wrote Gaston in his book W.D. Snodgrass, \u201creveal a poet intent on carefully establishing his creative priorities and perfecting his language.\u201d He continues, \u201cSnodgrass\u2019s criticism gives the impressions of a mind reaching beyond the pleasures of cleverness to the hard-won satisfactions of wisdom.\u201d And finally, \u201c[His] work with translations ... has encouraged the increasing linguistic, metrical, and structural diversity of his own work.\u201d\n\r\nThis diversity is apparent in Snodgrass\u2019s third volume of original poetry, The Fuehrer Bunker (1977), which uses dramatic monologues to recreate what was said by the men and women who shared Hitler\u2019s bunker from April 1 to May 1, 1945. \u201cIn these poems,\u201d writes Gertrude M. White in Odyssey: A Journal of the Humanities, \u201cwe are overhearing people talking to themselves, each character speaking in a verse form expressive of his or her personality, revealing who and what they are with a dramatic power that carries conviction almost against our will.\u201d Robert Peters, writing in the American Book Review, believes that the volume is \u201ca rare example of ambitious, on-going verse sculpture. ... It will be around for a long time to inspire writers who\u2019ve come to realize the sad limitations of the locked-in, private, first lesson, obsessional poem.\u201d\n\r\nHowever, the subject matter of the poems troubles critic Laurence Goldstein, who fears that the writer\u2019s choice of subject overwhelms the artistry of the writing. Goldstein, writing for the Southern Review, believes that writing about Nazism in the way that Snodgrass does in The Fuehrer Bunker violates the poetic aesthetic. \u201cWhen a poet as skilled in sweet rhetoric as Snodgrass,\u201d Goldstein declares, \u201cwho can charm and disarm his audience at will, presents twenty-two dramatic monologues spoken by the most despised Nazis, nothing less than ultimate questions about the enterprise of contemporary poetry loom before us.\u201d \u201cIs there a shameless sensationalism involved in trying to change belief on that dreadful subject?\u201d the critic asks. \u201cShouldn\u2019t the poet pass by the Medusa head of that modern horror lest he petrify, or worse entertain, himself and his readers by staring at vipers?\u201d The Fuehrer Bunker, which was first published as a work in progress in 1977, was finally released as a completed cycle of poems in 1995. Critics who reviewed the revised edition recognized its power, but their conclusions differed from Goldstein\u2019s fears. Frank Allen writes in Library Journal that \u201cto hear these voices imaginatively re-created is purgative,\u201d while Booklist contributor Elizabeth Gunderson calls it \u201can astonishing work that lets us see with clarity the fall of the Third Reich\u2014and wonder.\u201d\n\r\nSnodgrass\u2019s collection Each in His Season (1993) also raised questions among critics. New York Times Book Review contributor Bruce Bennett calls the work \u201ca large-scale, free-wheeling roller coaster of a book,\u201d adding that the poet \u201cdisplays his life and art in often contradictory guises.\u201d A Publishers Weekly reviewer dismisses the volume, declaring that it \u201cis almost completely stripped of content, with a few notable exceptions.\u201d William Pratt, writing in World Literature Today, declares that \u201cEach in His Season does no credit to W.D. Snodgrass or to any of his models.\u201d A reviewer for Poetry magazine offers a different assessment, asserting that \u201camong the major poets of his generation it would be difficult to find a wittier or more exuberant writer\u2014or one more committed to the making of verbal music.\u201d \u201cIf Snodgrass is not always convincing as plaintiff or prosecutor,\u201d the critic concludes, \u201che is both pleasing and persuasive in his role as lyric poet, the \u2018robin with green face,\u2019 singing exquisitely of \u2018all things vile and ugly.\u2019\u201d\n\r\nAfter teaching for 40 years, Snodgrass retired in 1995 to focus on his writing. He died in early 2009 at his home in Erieville, New York, where he lived for many years.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Confessional"]}}
