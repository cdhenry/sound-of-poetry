Tolson was one of America\u2019s leading Black poets. He wrote within the modernist tradition and his work was influenced by the Harlem Renaissance. Tolson was born in 1898 in Moberly, Missouri. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from Lincoln University in Chester County, Pennsylvania in 1924 and a master\u2019s degree in English and comparative literature from Columbia University in 1940. In 1947, Liberia appointed him as poet laureate. He is the author of numerous works, including the poetry collections Harlem Gallery: Book One, The Curator\u00a0(1965), Libretto for the Republic of Liberia (1953), and Rendezvous with America (1944), and the plays Black Boy (1963) and Black No More (1952).\nTolson had a vibrant teaching career. In Marshall, Texas, he taught English and speech at Wiley College, where he lead an award-winning debate team. From 1947 to 1965, he was a professor of English, speech, and drama at Langston University, a historically black college in Langston, Oklahoma.\nTolson\u2019s first book, Rendezvous with America (1944), includes the poem \u201cDark Symphony,\u201d which won first place in the American Negro Exposition National Poetry Contest in 1939. Robert M. Farnsworth asserted in the\u00a0Dictionary of Literary Biography that this poem \u201ccelebrates \u2026 the historic contribution of black Americans \u2026 ending with a proud and defiant prediction of black accomplishment and cultural realization.\u201d Other poems in the volume, written during World War II, address the war\u2019s destruction, human aspirations and corruption, and the possibility of achieving \u201ca new democracy of nations,\u201d according to Farnsworth.\nTolson attracted increased attention with his Libretto for the Republic of Liberia (1953), an epic poem commemorating the African nation\u2019s centennial. In The\u00a0Nation, poet and critic\u00a0John Ciardi\u00a0observed that, in this collection, Tolson creates \u201ca vision of Africa past, present, and future\u201d with \u201cprodigious eclecticism\u201d and \u201cforce of language and \u2026 rhythm.\u201d Donald B. Gibson, an essayist for the\u00a0Reference Guide to American Literature,\u00a0described the\u00a0Libretto\u00a0as \u201cpyrotechnic,\u201d and credited Tolson with creating \u201ca system of tensions not unlike the dynamic forces holding an atom or a galaxy together. Each element threatens to go off on its own; yet as long as the balance of forces remains constant, the system functions.\u201d\nPublished in 1965, Tolson\u2019s\u00a0Harlem Gallery: Book One, The Curator\u00a0is widely considered a poetic masterpiece. Robert Donald Spector, reviewing the poem for\u00a0Saturday Review\u00a0the year it appeared, judged that it \u201cmarks [Tolson] as one of America\u2019s great poets.\u201d Originally a sonnet, in the early 1930s, it became the book-length\u00a0Gallery of Harlem Portraits,\u00a0which remained unpublished during Tolson\u2019s life. In the 1950s, Tolson conceived it as part of a five-book epic about Harlem and Black America and revised it as\u00a0Harlem Gallery: Book One, The Curator.\u00a0A fictional gallery curator \u201cprovides the central point of view\u201d in the poem\u2019s discussions of Black art and life, remarked Farnsworth, \u201cbut three major characters, all practicing artists, dramatically amplify the reader\u2019s view of the black artist\u2019s dilemma and achievement.\u201d Stanzas in the style of blues music punctuate the portraits, reinforcing Tolson\u2019s points or offering ironic commentary. According to Blyden Jackson\u2019s\u00a0New Republic\u00a0critique, \u201cThe brotherhood of man and the universality of serious art \u2026 catalyze [the poem\u2019s] perceptions.\u201d\nTolson\u2019s skillful delineation of character, his ability to turn discussions of aesthetics into social commentary, his breadth of vision, and his deftness with language garnered critical acclaim. Reviewers compared\u00a0Harlem Gallery\u00a0to works by\u00a0Walt Whitman,\u00a0Edgar Lee Masters,\u00a0Hart Crane, and\u00a0T.S. Eliot\u00a0and praised with Spector \u201cthe richness and variety of [Tolson\u2019s] characters\u201d and the \u201callusiveness that absorbs classical, Biblical, oriental, and African references.\u201d According to Gibson, \u201cTolson, by virtue of an extraordinary mind and intelligence, keeps a vast array of disparate elements in constant relationship. His poetry is, therefore, coherent, and its primary effect is of the containment and control of vast reserves of energy.\u201d\nTolson died in 1966 in Dallas, Texas.\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Harlem Renaissance"]}}
