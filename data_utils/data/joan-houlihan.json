After earning her BA and MA degrees at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, she worked as a technical writer, reporter, editor, and driving force in the poetry community, founding the Concord Poetry Center (2004-2016) and the Colrain Poetry Manuscript Conference (2006-present). She is the author of six poetry collections, including It Isn\u2019t a Ghost if it Lives in Your Chest (2021); Shadow-feast (2018); Ay (2014); The Us (2009); The Mending Worm (2006); and Hand-held Executions: Poems & Essays (2003).\n\nHoulihan describes the space poets occupy as the revitalization of language and experience. Her own body of work manages at once to be deeply human and to push the boundaries of expression. A common pronoun gave rise to her third collection,\u00a0The Us, a poetic sequence spoken in the collective voice of nomadic hunter-gatherers at the threshold of language, which was named a 2009 must-read by the Massachusetts Center for the Book. \u201cThe Us\u00a0is like nothing I have ever read or seen,\u201d wrote\u00a0Lucie Brock-Broido,\u201c... these poems are just extraordinary: wildly hewn, classically construed and skewed by an imagined lexicon.\u201d The book ends with its protagonist, Ay, recovering from a life-threatening wound. In the sequel\u00a0Ay\u00a0(2014), the character \u201crecovers his speech & mobility & is treated as a god.\u201d\u00a0Ilya Kaminsky\u00a0praised the book\u2019s \u201cmagnificent force,\u201d calling it \u201cepic in scope, lyric in texture,\u201d while\u00a0Timothy Donnelly\u00a0noted that \u201cAy\u00a0deploys its fertile idiom not only for the pleasure of it, which is immeasurable, but as a medium through which to investigate, among other things, the mechanics of subjectivity, grief, empathy, and forgiveness.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Of Shadow-feast, Peter Covino wrote: \u201cThese are urgent and fiercely incorruptible lyrics where the unsettlingly oblique and surreal is juxtaposed against moments of lucid and visceral anguish.\u201d Rusty Morrison observed that \u201cWe find ourselves intuitively responding to every, even the least, \u2018flexing\u2019 of form, suggesting both in shifts and in recurrences how the coming of a death offers this constancy: all will become foreign, all hopes and self-protective devices will be violated. Each image is spare and resonate and will remain etched in this reader\u2019s mind.\u201d\nHoulihan has taught at Columbia University, Smith College and Emerson College, and is currently Professor of Practice at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. She also serves on the faculty of Lesley University\u2019s Low-Residency MFA program in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
