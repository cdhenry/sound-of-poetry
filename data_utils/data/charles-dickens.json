Along with 14 novels, many of them rich in topical allusion, he produced a body of work as reporter, essayist, correspondent, and editor that constitutes a lifelong account of the facts of Victorian life as he knew them. Dickens was a lover of facts in his work as a reporter, but his nonfiction work is anything but a mere collection of data. In his reporting and commentary, Dickens is often an outraged reformer, uncompromising in his attacks on privileged interests. In the early sketches, he is a writer trying to achieve a synthesis of art and social criticism. The surviving letters, some 14,500 of which the editors of the ongoing Pilgrim Edition have collected, reveal a man of astonishing energies, who attempted to impose an artist\u2019s vision of order on every aspect of his life and work. In the late essays, Dickens emerges as a restless, poetic wanderer who masterfully blends observation, autobiography, and allegory. Much of this prose is valuable as a window on the novelist\u2019s attitudes and preoccupations, but most of it stands on its own, the work of an acute observer and dedicated craftsman.\n\r\nThe experiences that nourished this prodigious talent began in Portsmouth, where Dickens was born on February 7, 1812 to John and Elizabeth Barrow Dickens. John Dickens was a clerk in the naval pay office, a job that took him and his family to London in 1814, to Chatham in 1817, and back to London in 1822. In Chatham the young Charles Dickens spent the happiest years of his childhood. He loved the sights and sounds of the busy shipbuilding center, and both his parents encouraged his early devotion to such 18th-century prose masters as Henry Fielding, Oliver Goldsmith, and Tobias Smollett. But his father\u2019s inability to live within his means, coupled with the growth of the Dickens household (Charles Dickens had four brothers and sisters by 1822), brought an early end to this happiness that coincided with the family\u2019s second move to London. Just two days past his 12th birthday, Dickens was sent to work in a warehouse pasting labels on shoe-blacking pots to supplement the family income; 11 days later his father was arrested for debt and taken to the Marshalsea debtor\u2019s prison. The double blow of his family\u2019s fall from fortune and his own banishment into drudgery and humiliation constituted an abrupt loss of innocence whose ache never fully subsided. Although a bequest freed his father from the Marshalsea after three months, and Dickens\u2019s own warehouse tenure lasted only four, the sense of insecurity and injustice these events instilled lasted a lifetime. At the same time, the experience benefited the future writer, broadening his scope, deepening his insight, and contributing to the astonishing energy and resolve with which he subsequently pursued his vocation.\n\r\nLess than a month after his father removed him from the blacking warehouse, Dickens was enrolled as a day student at the Wellington House Academy in London. Here, between the ages of 12 and 15, he was already trying his hand at the kind of writing that would launch him on his professional career. He submitted what was called \u201cpenny-a-line stuff\u201d to his father\u2019s employer, the\u00a0British Press:\u00a0information about fires, accidents, or police reports missed by the regular reporters. Several years later, constrained by his work as a clerk in a law office, he set himself the difficult task of mastering shorthand so as to return to journalism in earnest. In 1828, during his 16th year, he became a freelance reporter in the London law courts. For several years he alternated reporting, exploring the London streets, and reading avidly at the British Museum. Already devoted to the essays of Joseph Addison, Oliver Goldsmith, and\u00a0Samuel Johnson, he now read the major 19th-century essayists:\u00a0Leigh Hunt, William Hazlitt,\u00a0Charles Lamb,\u00a0Walter Savage Landor, and Thomas DeQuincey.\n\r\nIn his 20th year, Dickens secured a job as a parliamentary reporter for the\u00a0Mirror of Parliament, founded by his uncle John Henry Barrow. He worked there from 1832 to 1834. The reputation he made for himself would be the envy of any aspiring journalist. A contemporary of Dickens, James Grant of the\u00a0Morning Advertiser, claimed that Dickens \u201coccupied the very highest rank, not merely for accuracy in reporting, but for marvelous quickness in transcript.\u201d Despite his youth, he quickly won the respect of his older colleagues. \u201cThere never\u00a0was\u00a0such a shorthand writer!\u201d declared one of them. Dickens\u2019s observations of parliament during and after the heady days of the Reform Bill debates constituted the liberal education neither he nor his parents could afford to finance. It also committed him to reform while making him suspicious of many reformers. The only problem with the\u00a0Mirror of Parliament\u00a0was that it did not pay its staff members when parliament was not in session, which forced Dickens back to free-lance court reporting. Thus when the liberal daily newspaper the\u00a0Morning Chronicle\u00a0was reorganized and expanded, Dickens jumped at the chance of becoming one of its regular staff members. His thoroughness and speed helped the\u00a0Chronicle\u00a0provide serious competition to its conservative rival the\u00a0Times. The ambition that drove Dickens during these apprenticeship years, he later admitted to his friend and biographer John Forster, \u201cexcluded every other idea from my mind for four years, at a time of life when four years are equal to four times four.\u201d He added that he \u201cwent at it with a determination to overcome all difficulties, which fairly lifted me up into that newspaper life, and floated me away over a hundred men\u2019s heads.\u201d\n\r\nDickens\u2019s reputation as a reporter was soon eclipsed, however, by his growing fame as \u201cBoz,\u201d the name under which he wrote a series of tales and sketches published in the\u00a0Monthly Magazine,\u00a0Bell\u2019s Weekly Magazine, the\u00a0Morning Chronicle, the\u00a0Evening Chronicle, and\u00a0Bell\u2019s Life in London and Sporting Chronicle. He later collected these pieces in two hardcover volumes titled\u00a0Sketches by Boz\u00a0(1836), adding additional material and revising the originals. Many of the sketches are in fact essays, possessing a colloquial immediacy that vividly captures the lower- and middle-class street life he observed firsthand. In them Dickens introduced many of the scenes and much of the subject matter that later appeared in his fiction. For example, the sketch \u201cGin-Shops,\u201d besides demonstrating Dickens\u2019s knowledge of the lower reaches of Victorian society, is an early instance of the reformer\u2019s anger at those who condemn the symptoms of poverty without addressing its causes: \u201cGin-drinking is a great vice in England, but wretchedness and dirt are greater; and until you improve the homes of the poor, or persuade a half-famished wretch not to seek relief in the temporary oblivion of his own misery, with the pittance which, divided among his family, would furnish a morsel of bread for each, gin-shops will increase in number and splendor.\u201d\n\r\nWhen\u00a0Sketches by Boz\u00a0was published contemporary reviewers were impressed. The critic for the\u00a0Morning Post\u00a0said that the \u201cgraphic descriptions of \u2018Boz\u2019 invest all he describes with amazing fidelity.\u201d The\u00a0Sunday Herald\u00a0hailed the collected sketches as \u201cinimitably accurate.\u201d Many years later, during a banquet in his honor given by the New York press on April 18, 1868, Dickens attributed the verisimilitude of his writing to \u201cthe wholesome training of severe newspaper work.\u201d Recently, increased attention has been paid to the importance of the\u00a0Sketches by Boz. Of the many reassessments the best is Duane DeVries\u2019s\u00a0Dickens\u2019s Apprentice Years: The Making of a Novelist\u00a0(1976), which shows how these short pieces allowed Dickens to develop the technical skill necessary to his later achievements.\n\r\nThe origins of\u00a0The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club\u00a0(1836-1837), later known simply as\u00a0The Pickwick Papers, suggest that Dickens the novelist is often difficult to separate from Dickens the journalist. The success of\u00a0Sketches by Boz\u00a0brought Dickens to the attention of Edward Chapman and William Hall, booksellers and publishers of periodicals who had recently begun producing books. They proposed that Dickens provide a series of Boz-like sketches to accompany the illustrations of Robert Seymour, one of England\u2019s leading comic artists. Dickens would write and edit 20 monthly installments to be sold for one shilling apiece. As reported by biographer Edgar Johnson, Dickens\u2019s friends warned him that the shilling number was a \u201clow, cheap form of publication\u201d that would prevent him from rising to the rank of respectable writer, but to no avail. Dickens began writing a few days after his 24th birthday, and before the end of March 1836, he had written 24,000 words, enough for the first two installments. With the 29 pounds he received in payment Dickens was able to marry Catherine Hogarth (1815-1879) on April 2, leaving on a short honeymoon before the first installment was published. The couple\u2019s first child, Charles, was born nine months later; over the next 15 years came nine more children, several named after writers for whom Dickens had a special affinity: Mary, Kate,\u00a0Walter Landor,\u00a0Alfred Tennyson, Sydney Smith Haldemand, Henry Fielding, Dora Annie, and Edward Bulwer-Lytton.\n\r\nThe first number of\u00a0The Pickwick Papers\u00a0sold only 400 copies, but when the last number was printed in October 1837 the run was 40,000. In his preface to the first cheap edition of\u00a0The Pickwick Papers, Dickens ironically recalled the warning of his friends, concluding: \u201chow right my friends turned out to be, everybody now knows.\u201d The phenomenal success that resulted from this venture created an entirely new approach to the publication of novels. Previously, serial publication of literature was restricted to cheap reprints of classics or ephemeral nonfiction turned out by poorly paid hack writers. Readers bought or checked out novels in three-volume hardback editions. Dickens\u2019s gamble wedded the serial appeal of journalism to the emotional engagement of fiction. All of his subsequent novels were published in installments, and many other novelists adopted this mode.\n\nThe Pickwick Papers\u00a0turned Dickens from an obscure reporter into a celebrity, but it did not diminish his journalistic energy. While writing\u00a0The Pickwick Papers, in fact, he found that he could occasionally blend his journalism into his fiction. In May, with only two installments of\u00a0The Pickwick Papers\u00a0in print, Dickens, using the pseudonym Timothy Sparks, wrote a pamphlet fiercely attacking a bill that would prohibit all work and recreation on Sundays. The pamphlet,\u00a0Sunday Under Three Heads: As It Is; As Sabbath Bills Would Make It; As It Might Be Made, argued that without this day of recreation and enjoyment, increasing numbers of poor would resort to the gin shops, just the result that \u201cyour saintly law-givers\u201d are supposedly trying to avoid as they \u201clift up their hands to heaven, and exclaim for a law which shall convert the day intended for rest and cheerfulness, into one of universal gloom, bigotry, and persecution.\u201d In the pamphlet Dickens created a Nonconformist preacher whose hypocrisy anticipates that of the red-nosed minister Stiggins, who appeared in the December number of\u00a0The Pickwick Papers. And on June 22, on assignment for the\u00a0Morning Chronicle, Dickens attended a divorce case in which Lord Melbourne was accused of adultery with the wife of the Hon. George Norton; some of this material found its way into the farcical trial of Bardell vs. Pickwick, which appeared in the July installment. It is likely that the monthly praise Dickens received as Pickwick\u2019s adventures unfolded convinced him of the advantages of maintaining regular contact with his readers, as journalism allowed him to do. He did sever his connection with the\u00a0Morning Chronicle\u00a0in November 1836, but he continued to submit articles and letters to newspapers for the remainder of his life. He even agreed to become founding editor of a new radical paper, the\u00a0Daily News, in January 1846, but he was not suited for the role of daily-newspaper editor, and his tenure lasted a short 17 issues. His editorial ambitions, however, were not confined to newspapers.\n\r\nJanuary 1837 saw publication of the first issue of\u00a0Bentley\u2019s Miscellany, a monthly collection of fiction, biographical notes, verses, and humor edited by Dickens and published by Richard Bentley.\u00a0Oliver Twist, the first of Dickens\u2019s novels to be published as part of a magazine, was serialized in the\u00a0Miscellany\u00a0beginning with the second issue and published in three volumes by Bentley in 1838. The novel was partly inspired by Dickens\u2019s hatred of the New Poor Law, which he heard debated in Parliament and which he viewed as a subordination of the needs of the poor to institutional control and efficiency.\u00a0Oliver Twist\u00a0was a huge success for both Dickens and Bentley, but financial and editorial disputes between the two men became increasingly bitter. In a move that foreshadowed subsequent dealings with his publishers, Dickens resigned his position at the magazine in February 1839 in a disagreement over editorial control. At the end of an otherwise judicious and moderate farewell address published in the March issue, Dickens told his readers that the magazine had \u201calways been literally 'Bentley\u2019s Miscellany,' and never mine.\u201d\n\r\nSeeking greater editorial autonomy, Dickens arranged with Chapman and Hall to bring out a new weekly periodical, and\u00a0Master Humphry\u2019s Clock\u00a0was born on April 4, 1840. Conceived in the spirit of Addison\u2019s\u00a0Spectator\u00a0papers,\u00a0Master Humphry\u2019s Clock\u00a0began as a blend of sketches, essays, and tales but quickly faltered when readers discovered there was no engrossing novel by Dickens to hold their interest. Before the decline Dickens had discussed with Forster a short pathetic tale he would write for the magazine; when trouble arose he responded with a characteristic adaptability, turning the tale into a novel. Thus was\u00a0The Old Curiosity Shop\u00a0produced, one of many cases of Dickens\u2019s journalism fostering his fiction.\u00a0The Old Curiosity Shop\u00a0brought the circulation of\u00a0Master Humphry\u2019s Clock\u00a0up to 100,000, and Chapman and Hall published the novel in two volumes in 1841. But after\u00a0Barnaby Rudge\u00a0(1 volume, 1841) had also appeared in its pages, Dickens arranged with Chapman and Hall to discontinue the magazine in November 1841 and return to publishing his novels in monthly parts.\n\r\nFor Dickens, editing (or \u201cconducting\u201d as he later described it) a magazine was a way of maintaining close contact with his audience, something he learned to value during the publication of\u00a0The Pickwick Papers. When he decided to make his first trip to America, he used the preface to\u00a0Master Humphry\u2019s Clock\u00a0to announce his impending separation from his readers: \u201cI have decided, in January next, to pay a visit to America. The pleasure I anticipate from this realization of a wish I have long entertained \u2026 is subdued by the reflection that it must separate us for a longer time than other circumstances would have rendered necessary.\u201d Dickens and his wife left England on January 4, 1842, arriving in Boston on January 22 and returning on June 7.\n\r\nTheir itinerary was ambitious, taking them from the eastern seaboard to the southern slave states and west to St. Louis, then back via Ohio, Toronto, Montreal, and New York by way of Lake Champlain. The process whereby Dickens\u2019s infatuation with most things American turned to disillusionment is chronicled in a series of increasingly caustic letters he wrote home to friends and in books seven through 13 of\u00a0The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit\u00a0(published 1842-1844, in 20 parts). In much of\u00a0American Notes for General Circulation, published in two volumes in October 1842, Dickens replaces this vituperation with shrewd journalistic analyses of American institutions in light of their English counterparts: asylums, factories, prisons. His accounts of New York\u2019s Tombs prison and the Philadelphia penitentiary are especially powerful, recalling \u201cA Visit to Newgate\u201d in\u00a0Sketches by Boz. In his account of touring the Tombs, Dickens applies the mordant wit of the satirist to his description of an exchange he had with a prison guard. The guard had explained that the boy in one cramped cell had been locked up for \u201csafe keeping\u201d because he was a witness in the upcoming trial of his father. Dickens asked if this was not hard treatment for the witness, and the guard replied: \u201cWell, it ain\u2019t a very rowdy life, and\u00a0that\u2019s\u00a0a fact!\u201d\n\r\nDespite the generally moderate tone of\u00a0American Notes for General Circulation, certain U.S. papers reacted violently. The\u00a0New York Herald\u00a0reviewer called Dickens \u201cthat famous penny-a-liner,\u201d with \u201cthe most coarse, vulgar, imprudent, and superficial\u201d mind, whose view of America was that of \u201ca narrow-minded, conceited cockney.\u201d English readers were generally unimpressed and longed for another novel. 20th-century opinion ranges from high praise for the book\u2019s social criticism to disappointment at its lack of \u201cpersonality\u201d in comparison with Dickens\u2019s other travel book,\u00a0Pictures from Italy\u00a0(1846). A richly detailed account of the response to\u00a0American Notes for General Circulation\u00a0is provided in Michael Slater\u2019s introduction to\u00a0Dickens on America and the Americans, a collection that attests to the continuing appeal of Dickens\u2019s nonfiction.\n\r\nUnlike the two travel books, most of Dickens\u2019s journalism in the 1840s was strident and outspoken. On June 25, 1842 a fiery letter from Dickens appeared in the\u00a0Morning Chronicle\u00a0supporting Lord Ashley\u2019s Bill to bar women and girls from working in the mines. On July 7 he sent a circular letter that continued his criticisms of American publishers who pirated English books. In June 1843 he lashed out against the High Church movement in an unsigned piece for the\u00a0Examiner, where some of his best reporting appeared in the late 1840s, writing to its editor Albany Fonblanque about how misguided it was \u201cto talk in these times of most untimely ignorance among the people, about what Priests shall wear and whither they shall turn when they say their prayers!\u201d\n\r\nDickens began writing\u00a0A Child\u2019s History of England\u00a0at about this time, he told a friend, so his son Charley would not \u201cget hold of any conservative or High Church notions.\u201d A Child\u2019s History of England, published in\u00a0Household Words\u00a0beginning in 1851 and in three volumes from 1852 to 1854, is an ill-informed and often astonishingly slapdash production, but even here Dickens\u2019s radical opinions give rise to powerful imagery, as when he refers to Henry VIII as \u201ca blot of grease and blood upon the History of England.\u201d In March 1846 he wrote a long and carefully reasoned attack on capital punishment for the\u00a0Daily News, the editorship of which he had recently resigned. This attack was echoed in a November 13, 1849 letter to the\u00a0Times\u00a0on the evening of a public hanging. \u201cI do not believe that any community can prosper where such a scene of horror and demoralisation as was enacted this morning outside Horsemonger Lane Gaol is presented at the very doors of good citizens, and is passed by unknown and forgotten.\u201d Another campaign for reform had begun on January 20, 1849, with the appearance of the first of Dickens\u2019s four articles for the\u00a0Examiner\u00a0on the Tooting scandal, involving the deaths of 150 children at a childfarm outside of London. The article ends with a scathing indictment in the form of a characteristic peroration: \u201cThe cholera, or some unusually malignant form of typhus assimilating itself to that disease, broke out in Mr. Drouet\u2019s farm for children, because it was brutally conducted, vilely kept, preposterously inspected, dishonestly defended, a disgrace to a Christian community, and a stain upon a civilized land.\u201d\n\r\nFollowing the failed\u00a0Daily News\u00a0experiment, Dickens\u2019s next major journalistic project was\u00a0Household Words. Having broken with Chapman and Hall over their response to the poor sales of\u00a0Martin Chuzzlewit, Dickens contracted with his new publishers, William Bradbury and Frederick Evans, to bring out the first issue of the two penny weekly on 30 March 1850. This time Dickens was half-owner, assuring him editorial control, and for eight years he directed\u00a0Household Words\u00a0with an unerring sense of what would succeed. He also devoted extraordinary energies to every aspect of the magazine\u2019s production, from soliciting manuscripts to directing revisions to acting as a sort of silent collaborator on most of the articles. As Harry Stone has shown in his introduction to Dickens\u2019s\u00a0Uncollected Writings from Household Words\u00a0(1968), Dickens made certain that every contribution to the magazine was consistent with his views. Central to these views was a belief in the restorative power of the imagination. In \u201cA Preliminary Word\u201d to the first issue of the magazine, Dickens proclaimed that\u00a0Household Words\u00a0would teach \u201cthe hardest workers at this whirling wheel of toil, that their lot is not necessarily a moody, brutal fact, excluded from the sympathies and graces of imagination.\u201d He added that the magazine would show that \u201cin all familiar things, even in those which are repellent on the surface, there is Romance enough, if we will find it out.\u201d This clothing of fact in the fabric of fancy is evident in \u201cValentine\u2019s Day at the Post Office,\u201d an article that details the workings of London\u2019s central postal office. W.H. Wills wrote the bulk of the article, but Dickens\u2019s improving hand is evident in many sections, including the following passage, describing the scene as the deadline for posting newspapers approaches: \u201cBy degrees it began to rain hard; by fast degrees the storm came on harder and harder, until it blew, rained, hailed, snowed, newspapers. A fountain of newspapers played in at the window. Water-spouts of newspapers broke from enormous sacks, and engulphed the men inside.\u201d\n\r\nDickens published a great many of this kind of essay in\u00a0Household Words\u00a0(he called them \u201cprocess\u201d articles), on subjects ranging from the production of plate glass to the editing and printing of\u00a0Household Words\u00a0itself. He also made room for a series of major novels, from Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell\u2019s\u00a0North and South\u00a0to his own\u00a0Hard Times. In addition, the magazine often became the voice of Dickens the radical moralist. The January 4 1851 issue, for instance, contained an article that presented a very different image of England from that promoted by the Great Exhibition of that year. Titled \u201cThe Last Words of the Old Year,\u201d the article catalogued the legacy of 1850: dispossessed and hungry children, desperate farmers, crowded slums, sewers that spread disease throughout the country. He \u201cbequeathed\u201d to the new year \u201ca vast inheritance of degradation and neglect in England, a general mismanagement of all public expenditure, revenues and property.\u201d To urge reform of these \u201cbrutal\u201d facts, Dickens regularly employed\u00a0Household Words\u00a0to campaign for improvements in sanitation, slum housing, popular education, and workplace safety, and for the right workingmen to form trade unions. This blend of information, art, and radical polemic produced a lively hybrid, something like a cross between the\u00a0New Yorker\u00a0and the\u00a0Nation\u00a0but with a broader appeal than either.\n\r\nOn April 30, 1859 Dickens brought out the first issue of\u00a0All the Year Round, a magazine that had its origins in a feud with Bradbury and Evans. Dickens had begun to make reference to his marital troubles in several letters of the early 1850s; in April 1857 he met the actress Ellen Ternan, who was 27 years his junior. His infatuation with Ellen made him determined to establish Catherine in a separate household, a move that was accompanied by ill-conceived public announcements, including a front-page address to the readers of the June 12, 1858 issue of\u00a0Household Words. Bradbury and Evans disapproved of this publicity and were critical of the stories that were circulating about Dickens\u2019s affair with Ternan. Dickens\u2019s anger over their response, coupled with his desire for total control over publication, drove him to sever his relations with the publishers, begin\u00a0All the Year Round, and buy\u00a0Household Words\u00a0in order to close it down. The last issue of\u00a0Household Words\u00a0was published on May 28, 1859. Dickens was the publisher and editor of\u00a0All the Year Round\u00a0until his death, and in most ways it was a continuation of the successful formula of its predecessor. But Dickens did break with the tradition of unsigned articles in 1860 when he was announced as the author of a series of essays narrated by The Uncommercial Traveler. Employed by the \u201cgreat house of the Human Interest Brothers,\u201d the Traveler wanders through a variety of London landscapes and rural scenes. In evocative, memorable images, Dickens describes workhouses, cheap theaters, churches, tramps, merchants, \u00e9migr\u00e9s, and, at times, himself. The reminiscences, many of them recollections of childhood, supplement the autobiographical fragment Dickens wrote (published in Forster\u2019s 1905\u00a0The Life of Dickens) and provide insight into a childhood more famously evoked in\u00a0The Personal History of David Copperfield\u00a0(20 parts, 1849-1850) and\u00a0Great Expectations\u00a0(1861). The latter novel, first published in\u00a0All the Year Round\u00a0beginning December 1, 1860, was in fact initially conceived as a sketch for The Uncommercial Traveler series. Many of the essays in this series incorporate current events, but unlike the polemical journalism of the same period, they are more clearly literary productions. In an otherwise limited formulation, John Forster aptly characterized Dickens\u2019s approach in this kind of essay: \u201cIn his character of journalist Mr. Dickens has from the first especially laboured to cultivate the kindly affections and the fancy at the same time with the intellect.\u201d More recently, Gordon Spence has analyzed the literary qualities of several of these essays in\u00a0Charles Dickens as a Familiar Essayist\u00a0(1977).\n\r\nDuring the last months of his life, while writing\u00a0The Mystery of Edwin Drood\u00a0(6 parts, 1870) and concluding a final series of phenomenally successful but physically punishing public readings, Dickens remained faithful to the profession that first nurtured his talent. In the spring of 1870 he made several trips to London to supervise his son Charley in the offices of\u00a0All the Year Round. At the end of April he officially installed him as subeditor. On April 5, he gave a speech at the annual dinner of the Newsvendors' Benevolent Association, a group which aided the ragged boys and discharged servicemen who peddled newspapers in the streets. On June 2, seven days before his death, he added a codicil to his will which gave his son his interest in\u00a0All the Year Round. In his journalism as in his fiction, he remained a consummate professional to the end. \u2014 James Diedrick, Albion College\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Victorian"]}}
