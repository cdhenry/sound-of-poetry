A poet, critic, and the author of both a novel and a collection of short fiction, Bishop travelled in circles that included Robert Penn Warren, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Allen Tate, and Edmund \u201cBunny\u201d Wilson, whose contributions to North American literary criticism have become almost legendary. Indeed, it proved to be these close friends that worked to bring Bishop\u2019s written work to an appreciative audience: Tate would edit Bishop\u2019s Collected Poems and Wilson his Collected Essays, both of which were published in 1948, four years after Bishop\u2019s death. Although its author was classified by literary scholars as a minor American poet, \u201cThe Hours,\u201d Bishop\u2019s impassioned elegy to Fitzgerald, was praised by critic Robert Lee White in the Dictionary of Literary Biography as \u201cone of the finest of twentieth-century poems.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nBorn in what is now Charleston, West Virginia, in 1892, Bishop was raised in a well-to-do family where artistic talents were encouraged and cultivated. In addition to any contributions to his intellect, a childhood illness would delay Bishop\u2019s formal schooling by two years. He would be twenty-one years of age by the time he enrolled in Princeton University, which he attended from 1913 to 1917, and where he studied alongside Fitzgerald and Wilson. While a student at Princeton Bishop also served alongside Wilson as managing editor of the university\u2019s Nassau Literary Magazine; his association with Fitzgerald would later provide the inspiration for the character Thomas Parke D\u2019Invilliers in that author\u2019s This Side of Paradise. Bishop published his first poetry collection Green Fruit after graduation and before being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Infantry R.O.T.C. in 1917.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe author\u2019s experiences of the immediate aftermath of the Great War\u2014during which time he served as a member of a reinterment force of the American Expeditionary Force then stationed in Paris\u2014would inspire both the short story \u201cResurrection\u201d (published in 1922\u2019s The Undertaker\u2019s Garland) and an enduring love for France. Bishop\u2019s philosophical alliance with the nihilistic post-World War I \u201cLost Generation\u201d was present in his contributions to The Undertaker\u2019s Garden, a collection of short fiction and verse on which he collaborated with Wilson and which reflected the morbid disillusionment felt by many writers and artists of the period.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAfter his marriage to Margaret Hutchins in 1922, and a two-year turn as managing editor at the New York City-based Vanity Fair magazine, Bishop would return to Paris, making it his home off and on for the next ten years. This decade found him in the company of expatriate writers that included Ezra Pound, Ernest Hemingway, E.E. Cummings, and Archibald MacLeish. While surrounding himself with this community of literary artists, Bishop also contributed essays, short fiction, and poems to a variety of U.S. and European periodicals.\r\n\u00a0\r\nCompleted in 1931, near the end of their author\u2019s stay on the continent, the five short stories collected in Bishop\u2019s Many Thousands Gone were, despite their author\u2019s presence in cosmopolitan Paris, clearly American in their origins. Imbued with Bishop\u2019s childhood recollections of the antebellum South, both Many Thousands Gone and his second work of fiction, 1935\u2019s Act of Darkness, were enriched by the perspective of time and cultural distance that residence in Europe had given their author. Set in a fictional West Virginia town, Many Thousands Gone covers the history of an older and still more devastating war\u2014that between the North and the South\u2014and reflects its author\u2019s thoughts on the relationship between love and mortality, both for individuals and communities. A story of the covert sexuality and violence that underlies the glossy veneer of civility in genteel Southern society, the novel Act of Darkness would be Bishop\u2019s only full-length work of fiction.\r\n\u00a0\r\nMeanwhile, having returned to the United States in 1933, Bishop moved to New London, Connecticut, his father\u2019s birthplace, and then to New Orleans before making a permanent home in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Now back in the States he published Now with His Love, a collection of romantic verses written in praise of his wife, Margaret. The work was criticized by some contemporary reviewers who felt that the work suffered due to the poet\u2019s obvious imitation of the style of Pound and Eliot. \u201cVery few [poems] reflect anything of Bishop\u2019s sojourn in France,\u201d noted critic Robert Lee White in hindsight, \u201calthough it might be argued that three of the most successful\u2014\u2018Ode,\u2019 \u2018The Return,\u2019 and \u2018Perspectives Are Precipices\u2019\u2014owe a good deal to the paintings he had viewed in the galleries and museums of Paris.\u201d Two more collections of poetry would follow\u2014Minute Particulars and Selected Poems\u2014prior to Bishop\u2019s premature death as a result of heart disease.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn addition to fiction and verse, Bishop published several essays during his writing career. Selected and edited by Wilson in 1948, Bishop\u2019s Collected Essays reflect the author\u2019s intellectual ruminations over, as Wilson would note in his introduction, \u201cvarious aspects of civilization: literature, painting, moving pictures, architecture, manners, religion.\u201d While criticized, particularly by Marxist reviewers, for his avoidance of pressing social issues, the Great Depression for example, Bishop has since been praised for the strong moral sense and literary backdrop that imbue both his prose and poetry.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPublished in 1981, The Republic of Letters in America contains letters between Bishop and fellow Southerner Allen Tate. Encompassing the period between July 1929 and March 1944, the letters contain each man\u2019s line-by-line critiques of the other\u2019s written works, and encouragement in pursuing their individual literary efforts. While commenting that \u201ctheir own social visions, based on Tate\u2019s roseate view of the antebellum South, were equally silly,\u201d a reviewer for the New Yorker praised the collection as \u201ca valuable guide to the nature of poetic work and a model for critics as well.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nDuring his career and in the decade following, Bishop would be classified by critics as a \u201cSouthern\u201d writer in the school of William Faulkner, Eudora Welty, and Caroline Gordon; however, his later poetry, in particular, was later seen to transcend such regional classification. Both his extended stay in Europe and the eventual move to New England would influence such works as his \u201cA Subject of Sea Change.\u201d As Ashley Brown noted in Reference Guide to American Literature, \u201cone should see Bishop as an American poet who is descended from a great tradition of American humanism.\u201d Frequent illnesses caused his ouevre to be limited; frequent comparison to others of his generation caused his works to be neglected by many critics despite the efforts of his friends to bring them to public attention. As George F. Hayhoe noted in Dictionary of Literary Biography: \u201c[Bishop\u2019s] reputation would perhaps have fared better in a country that had no Fitzgerald or Hemingway, in a region that could claim no Faulkner or Welty.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
