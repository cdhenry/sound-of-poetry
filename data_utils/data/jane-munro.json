Blue Sonoma\u00a0explores spirituality and\u00a0her late husband\u2019s battle with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In an interview, she says, \u201cWhile I was writing Blue Sonoma, I was recording dreams. This kept me in a conversation with images from the less-conscious recesses of my mind. If I\u2019m right that we share some of this material, then dream imagery may also connect with deeper layers of the reader\u2019s consciousness.\u201d \u00a0 Munro is the winner of the 2007 Banff Centre Bliss Carman Poetry Award and the 1978 Macmillan Prize for Poetry. Her writing has been anthologized in Best Canadian Poetry 2013 and has appeared in Poetry Canada Review, Event, The Fiddlehead, Prism International, and elsewhere.
