Hailed for his elegant, intelligent verse, Doty has often been compared to James Merrill, Walt Whitman and C.P. Cavafy. His syntactically complex and aesthetically profound free verse poems, odes to urban gay life, and quietly brutal elegies to his lover, Wally Roberts, have been hailed as some of the most original and arresting poetry written today. The recipient of numerous grants and fellowships, Doty has also won a number of prestigious literary awards, including the Whiting Writer\u2019s Award, the T. S. Eliot Prize, the National Poetry Series, the Los Angeles Times Book Award, the National Book Critics\u2019 Circle Award, the PEN/Martha Albrand Award for first nonfiction, and the National Book Award for Fire to Fire: New and Selected Poems (2008). A long-time resident of Provincetown, Massachusetts, Doty teaches at Rutgers University in New Jersey.\nAs the son of an army engineer, Mark Doty grew up in a succession of suburbs in Tennessee, Florida, southern California, and Arizona. He has described himself as having been \u201ca sissy\u201d; frightened by his emerging sexual identity, he married hastily at age eighteen. After completing his undergraduate studies at Drake University in Iowa, he got a divorce and moved to Manhattan, where he paid his dues as a temporary office worker. He earned a master\u2019s degree in creative writing from Goddard College during part-time semesters; during the same period, he met his first great love, Wally Roberts. The couple lived together for twelve years in Manhattan and Provincetown. Wally\u2019s illness and death from AIDS in 1994 was the central event in Doty\u2019s young life as both a person and poet. In the interim, however, Doty was publishing his early work.\n\r\nOn its publication in 1987, Booklist praised the \u201cquiet, intimate\u201d Turtle, Swan for turning the gay experience into \u201can example of how we live, how we suffer and transcend suffering.\u201d Marianne Boruch, in American Poetry Review, called the volume \u201ca stunning arrival.\u201d Doty\u2019s second collection, Bethlehem in Broad Daylight (1991), also won praise from critics. Miriam Levine, in American Book Review, appreciated Doty\u2019s gift for \u201csimple speech,\u201d arguing that \u201cDoty\u2019s poems work best when he finds his way back and forth between the vernacular and the elegant music of desire and loss.\u201d Poetry reviewer David Baker commended Doty for \u201cwell-ordered poetry whose primary method is anecdotal, whose speaker is singular and personal, and whose vision is skeptical.\u201d If there was a problem in Doty\u2019s work, Baker hypothesized, it was the poet\u2019s \u201cdetachment from his own story\u201d\u2014Doty, he claimed, approached his subjects as a \u201cprivileged observer and commentator.\u201d\n\r\nDoty\u2019s status as detached observer to his own work was significantly complicated by his next volume, My Alexandria (1993), which won the National Poetry Series contest. Here, Doty confronts the pain of life as seen through the prism of AIDS. Yet, as Ray Gonzalez noted in the Los Angeles Times Book Review, \u201cDoty goes beyond the triumph of the plague to write about life beyond this dark century\u2026He has the courage to extract beauty out of the living moments created by death.\u201d In the Yale Review, Vernon Shetley observed, \u201cDoty\u2019s writing displays tremendous craft in ways that have become fairly unusual in our poetry\u2026And one senses in the poetry as well an admirable assurance in the choices he makes.\u201d Jonathan Bing, who interviewed Doty for Publishers Weekly, looked back on My Alexandria as \u201ca watershed\u201d in Doty\u2019s career,\u201d full of \u201cluminous studies of urban and natural flux.\u201d Doty himself told Bing that he thought of My Alexandria as \u201ca real change\u2026I was casting about for what would come next. And what came next for me was looking around at the present and adult life,\u201d in contrast to the poems of remembered youth in his earlier books. In addition to winning the National Book Critics\u2019 Circle Prize, My Alexandria also won the most prestigious British award for a collection of poetry, the T.S. Eliot Prize. He was the first American ever to have done so.\n\r\nDoty\u2019s next volume, Atlantis (1995) was a response to, and in many respects a description of, Wally\u2019s illness and death. The poet and memoirist Patricia Hampl called the book simply \u201cmiraculous.\u201d Hampl loved Doty\u2019s casual voice and his ability to make something universal\u2014\u201dan emblem that springs open for us all\u201d\u2014out of an individual tragedy. She compared Doty to Keats in being \u201cpoised on exact perception. When he sees the ocean\u2014the salt spray hits you.\u201d The Yale Review critic Willard Spiegelman applauded both the work\u2019s visual quality and its \u201csmooth, graceful\u201d music. However, after Wally\u2019s death, Doty found himself unable to write or even read. The solicitation of a poem by a friend who was editing an anthology led him to the writing, not of a poem, but of a book-length memoir, Heaven\u2019s Coast (1996), in which he came to grips, in prose, with Wally\u2019s life and death. \u201cIt was a real gift to be able to write it\u201d at that troubled moment, Doty told Bing. Doty deliberately refrained from organizing the book carefully and it is a patchwork of memories, including quotations from friends\u2019 letters. Bernard Cooper in the Los Angeles Times Book Review appreciated Doty\u2019s literary strategy: \u201cHow else, except with tentative, borrowed strength, can one grapple with the indifference of death?\u201d Cooper called Heaven\u2019s Coast a \u201cpowerful memoir.\u201d\n\r\nDoty\u2019s next works of non-fiction were met with great critical acclaim. His second memoir, Firebird (1999), was described in Newsweek as \u201cthe poet\u2019s beautifully written, hallucinatorily evocative memoir of growing up gay in baby-boom America.\u201d Reviewing the book for Salon, Jaime Manrique described it as Doty\u2019s \u201cmost satisfying book\u2026In these pages, Doty\u2019s writing surpasses anything he\u2019s ever attempted before and achieves a depth and a clear-eyed splendor that left me bereft and exalted at the same time. What had begun as an oft-told story becomes an authentic tragedy.\u201d.In Still Life with Oysters and Lemon (2001), Doty presents an extended meditation on a Dutch still-life painting by Jan Davidsz de Heem, painted in Antwerp 350 years ago. Doty\u2019s next work of non-fiction, Dog Years (2007), was a return to memoir. A New York Times best-seller, the book dealt with themes familiar to many readers of Doty\u2019s work: death, grief and memory. The book, however, begins by focusing on Doty\u2019s two dogs, Beau and Arden, and the relationship the poet develops with them. Reviewing the book in the Guardian, Decca Aitkenhead claimed that the book transcends its ostensible subject matter: \u201cBereavement, ultimately, is Doty\u2019s subject. Through the narrative of his ailing dogs\u2019 last days, Doty explores the different textures of hope and denial, despair and depression.\u201d Danielle Chapman, in the New York Times Book Review, however, found that book \u201cwith its breathless aestheticizing of dog life, its melodrama and its rehashing of old material\u2026often comes dangerously close to parodying Doty\u2019s best work.\u201d \u00a0\nThough increasingly successful as a memoirist, Doty has continued to publish award-winning collections of poetry. His volumes following Atlantis, including Sweet Machine (1998), Source (2001), and School of the Arts (2005) have all been highly praised. In a review for the Progressive, Joel Brouwer stated: \u201cIn Sweet Machine, we see an already masterful poet refusing to lapse into nostalgia or to unthinkingly reuse the poetic strategies that have served him so well in the past. Instead, we find Mark Doty exploring new territories and questioning himself at every turn.\u201d Ruth Padel described Doty as a \u201cpoet of glow\u201d in her review of Source in the New York Times. Admitting that Doty\u2019s work has \u201calways celebrated surfaces and lyric glitter,\u201d Padel maintained that \u201cthe surface glow does not merely delight us, but also leads us deeper in, to insight. The important variety in Doty is not rhythm or vocabulary but situation: all that iridescence is there to tell us something about being human.\u201d\nBut Doty\u2019s collection Fire to Fire: New and Selected Poems (2008) was arguably his most successful yet. Awarded the National Book Award for poetry, the book was praised for its emotional range and dexterous treatment of beauty. Reginald Shepherd, in a review for Publisher\u2019s Weekly, noted that \u201cunlike his contemporaries, Doty has never eschewed beauty. Indeed, beauty, its unlikely, often unexpected, yet constant recurrence and its elusive fleetingness, is central.\u201d With that emphasis on beauty Doty brings an attention to the particular, and a deep engagement with the world. Shepherd concluded: \u201cThe poems combine close attention to the fragile, contingent things of the world with the constant, almost unavoidable chance of transcendence, since \u2018desire can make anything into a god.\u2019\u201d Or, as Elizabeth Lund put it in the Christian Science Monitor, \u201cMark Doty holds a magnifying glass to his subjects. He uses language as a way to highlight a moment, elevate it, and unearth hidden depth and meaning. Fire to Fire\u2026 illustrates how he has done this over the past 20 years.\u201d Doty\u2019s recent collections include\u00a0a collaboration with the painter Darren Waterston, A Swarm, A Flock, A Host: A Compendium of Creatures (2013), and the poetry collection Deep Lane (2015).\nIn an interview with poet Mark Wunderlich published in the Cortland Review, Doty was asked why he thought poetry endured as an art form. He answered: \u201cMy guess is that somehow poetry is a vessel for the expression of subjectivity unlike any other; a good poem bears the stamp of individual character in a way that seems to usher us into the unmistakably idiosyncratic perceptual style of the writer. I think we\u2019re hungry for singularity, for those aspects of self that aren\u2019t commodifiable, can\u2019t be marketed. In an age marked by homogenization, by the manipulation of desire on a global level\u2026poetry may represent the resolutely specific experience. The dominant art forms of our day\u2014film, video, architecture\u2014are collaborative arts; they require a team of makers. Poems are always made alone, somewhere out on the edge of things, and if they succeed they are saturated with the texture of the uniquely felt life.\u201d\n", "attrs": {}}
