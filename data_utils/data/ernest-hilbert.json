A skillful practitioner of form and nuance, Hilbert shifts between delicately sonic moments and humorous narrative sequences. As poet and critic Adam Kirsch noted of the poems in Sixty Sonnets, \u201cIn these sonnets, whose dark harmonies and omnivorous intellect remind the reader of Robert Lowell\u2019s, Hilbert is alternately fugitive and connoisseur, hard drinker and high thinker.\u201d Hilbert\u2019s second collection, All of You on the Good Earth (2013), returns to his idiosyncratic, highly inventive sonnet form. \u00a0 Hilbert founded the Oxford Quarterly and E-Verse Radio. He has also served as editor of both the Contemporary Poetry Review and Random House\u2019s magazine Bold Type. Hilbert\u2019s work has been included in The Swallow Anthology of New American Poets (2009), and he has collaborated with composers such as Daniel Felsenfeld, Stella Sung, and Christopher LaRosa. His spoken word album, Elegies & Laments (2013), includes tracks of Hilbert\u2019s poems backed by his band, Legendary Misbehavior. \u00a0 Hilbert lives with his wife in Philadelphia, where he works as a rare book dealer.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
