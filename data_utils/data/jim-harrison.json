His connection to rural landscapes was evident in his free-verse, imagistic poetry, which often explores human and animal drives set against an unforgiving natural world. Noting the poetry\u2019s relation to Hemingway\u2019s prose style in a review of Harrison\u2019s Selected & New Poems 1961\u20131981, poet and critic Richard Tillinghast declared in the New York Times that \u201cMr. Harrison has few equals as a writer on outdoor life, the traditional heritage and proving ground of the American male.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nHarrison earned a BA and MA\u00a0at Michigan State University, and he taught briefly at SUNY Stony Brook. After the publication of his first collection of poetry, Plain Song (1965), he returned to Michigan, where he worked as a freelance journalist and laborer until he began to earn a living from his writing.\n\nHarrison published more than a dozen collections of poetry, including\u00a0Livingston Suite\u00a0(2005),\u00a0Saving Daylight\u00a0(2006),\u00a0In Search of Small Gods\u00a0(2009),\u00a0Songs of Unreason\u00a0(2011), and\u00a0Dead Man's Float\u00a0(2016). He was also well known as\u00a0a fiction writer, publishing numerous novels and collections. His novel\u00a0Legends of the Fall\u00a0(1979)\u00a0received considerable critical acclaim and was made into a 1995 feature film. Harrison wrote several screenplays for Warner Bros. and other studios.\u00a0He served as poetry editor of The Nation and coeditor of Sumac. He wrote a food column, \u201cThe Raw and the Cooked,\u201d for Esquire magazine, and his collection of essays, Just Before Dark (1991), includes some of his food writing along with literary and nature essays.
