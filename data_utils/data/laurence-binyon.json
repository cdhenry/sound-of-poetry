During this time, he authored numerous poetry collections and plays, two historical biographies, and several art history volumes, including books on the works of Asian artists, English watercolorists, and William Blake\u2019s drawings and engravings. He is perhaps best remembered for his World War I poem, \u201cFor the Fallen,\u201d and his translation of Dante Alighieri\u2019s Divine Comedy, which he translated in its original terza rima, a remarkable undertaking much admired by Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, and other younger poets. \nBinyon showed an early interest in art and poetry. He was born Robert Laurence Binyon on August 10, 1869 in Lancaster, England and was the second of nine children born to clergyman Frederick and Mary Binyon. After attending St. Paul\u2019s School in London, he attended Trinity College at Oxford, where his poem \u201cPersephone\u201d was awarded the Newdigate Prize. He earned a degree in classical moderations in 1890, and a degree in\u00a0litterae humainoires in 1892.\u00a0Meanwhile, he published four poems in a volume called\u00a0Primavera: Poems by Four Authors (1890),\u00a0which included the work of three other young Oxford undergraduates, one of whom was his cousin, Stephen Phillips, who also achieved a measure of fame as a poet. Binyon married Cicely Margaret Powell in 1904, and they had three daughters together.\nPoetry and visual arts shaped his career, the majority of which was spent with the British Museum, where he began in the department of printed books in 1895 before moving to department of prints and drawings, from which he retired in 1933. His first book of poetry, Lyric Poems (1894),\u00a0was quickly followed by two books on painting,\u00a0Dutch Etchers of the Seventeenth Century\u00a0(1895) and\u00a0John Crone and John Sell Cotman\u00a0(1897). Later books such as\u00a0Painting in the Far East\u00a0(1908) and\u00a0The Flight of the Dragon\u00a0(1911) reflect this interest in Chinese, Japanese, and Indian arts and cultures. Ezra Pound praised The Flight of the Dragon and thought of Binyon as a pioneer in the Western appreciation of Asian art.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBinyon served as an orderly in the Red Cross during World War I, and his experiences would become an important part of his poetry. From 1915 to 1916 he worked in a military hospital in France, an experience reflected in his war poem \u201cFetching the Wounded.\u201d His collections The Winnowing Fan (1914),\u00a0The Anvil (1916),\u00a0The Cause (1917),\u00a0and\u00a0The New World (1918)\u00a0deal with the war as a noble cause. One reviewer from\u00a0Literature Digest\u00a0contended that WWI as a subject brought a new vitality to the poet\u2019s work: \u201cLaurence Binyon\u2019s poetry once was somewhat coldly \u2018literary\u2019\u2014aloof from common human experience, but the war has given him new vigor and new humanity.\u201d His best-known war poem, \u201cFor the Fallen,\u201d has been frequently anthologized was widely embraced by the British public. \u201cAs the casualty lists grew,\u201d notes John Hatcher in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, \u201cthe poem became the focal expression of national grief, both alone and in\u00a0Sir Edward Elgar's\u00a0choral work\u00a0The Spirit of England\u00a0(1916\u201317). Its central quatrain was carved on cenotaphs and tombstones worldwide and is still recited at annual Remembrance Day commemorations: \u201cThey shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old / Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn / At the going down of the sun and in the morning / We will remember them.\u201d \n\u00a0Binyon worked in a variety of forms. The Sirens (1926) and\u00a0The Idols (1928) are epic poems that treat man\u2019s struggle to come to terms with himself. The latter prompted a\u00a0New York Herald Tribune\u00a0reviewer to write, \u201cMr. Binyon\u2019s penetration into the centers of ultimate darkness, which takes place in \u201cThe Idols,\u2019 rewards him with many jewels of his own finding.\u201d Influenced by John Masefield, who argued that verse should be spoken aloud, Binyon became interested in experimental versification. While at Oxford, Robert Bridges had shared with him the complex rhythms of Gerard Manley Hopkins\u2019s sprung verse, which could not yet be found in print. Though Binyon\u2019s own experiments were not as radical, he was skilled at manipulating verse within strictly defined limits, as demonstrated by his careful translation of Dante\u2019s\u00a0Divine Comedy.\u00a0\nBinyon enjoyed a reputation for craft and elegance. One reviewer of\u00a0Binyon\u2019s Selected Poems (1922) wrote,\u00a0\u201cIt is the sort of verse teachers used to like to read aloud in school because of its academic sense and the perfect beat of its feet.\u201d While Binyon\u2019s poetry is not entirely didactic, it often contains a sense of uplift. James Granville Southworth, writing for the\u00a0Sewanee Review, found Binyon\u2019s work to be inspirational and motivating:\u00a0\u201cIn contrast to the poetry of Mr. T.S. Eliot, Mr. Binyon affects a reconstruction of beauty against the forces of disintegration\u2014forces against which Mr. Eliot seems powerless to act. Mr. Eliot\u2019s poetry is a balm to the contemporary who lacks the strength to combat the anticultural forces of the present day. Mr. Binyon\u2019s poetry is a constant challenge to a fuller life.\u201d \nAfter his retirement from the British Museum in 1933, Binyon received an honorary DLitt from Oxford University, was named an honorary fellow of Trinity College, and continued to lecture on art and literature at many universities in the United States, Holland, China, Scandinavia, Japan, Rome, Berlin, Vienna, and Paris. He followed T.S. Eliot at Harvard as Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University in 1933, where he summarized his life\u2019s study of Asian art in a series of lectures later published as The Spirit of Man in Asian Art (1935). He was also named a chevalier of the French Foreign Legion, a fellow of the Royal Society, and was appointed to the Byron Chair of Letters at Athens at the age of 70. \nSome of Binyon\u2019s greatest poetry was produced during the final decade of his life, \u201cgreater perhaps than that of any of his generation except\u00a0[W.B.] Yeats,\u201d according to John Hatcher. Among this exceptional later work are such volumes as The North Star and other Poems (1941), The Burning of the Leaves (1944), and the unfinished \u201cThe Madness of Merlin\u201d (1947). During this time, Binyon was also at work on his much-admired and well-received terza rima translation of Dante\u2019s Inferno (1933), Purgatorio (1938), and Paradiso (1943). Mere days after completing final revisions on his Paradiso translation, Laurence Binyon died of bronchopneumonia on March 10, 1943. Upon Binyon\u2019s death, English author and literary critic Cyril Connolly honored the poet in New Statesman and Nation as someone who understood \u201chow to be both warm and detached, in fact, a sage.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
