He is the author of 12 books of poetry, including Family Reunion (1983), which won an Arts and Letters Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Zimmer is also one of the founders of the Pitt Poetry Series and has served as the director of university presses in Georgia, Iowa, and Pittsburgh.\u00a0\nZimmer\u2019s poetry engages everyday life, using free-verse lines and unadorned diction to highlight the drama and wit of ordinary situations. Poet William Stafford, who selected Zimmer\u2019s collection The Great Bird of Love (1989) for the National Poetry Series, described the book as \u201cquirky, full of surprise, variety, [and] humor,\u201d noting that Zimmer\u2019s \u201clanguage is alive with verbal adventure.\u201d\u00a0\nZimmer has received various awards and honors for his poetry and prose, including six Pushcart Prizes, two National Endowment for the Arts Literature Fellowships, a Helen Bullis Memorial Award, and an Open Book Award from the American Society of Journalists and Authors, among others.
