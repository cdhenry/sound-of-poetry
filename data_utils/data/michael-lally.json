He joined the Air Force before gravitating toward the poetry scenes associated with both the Beats and the second generation New York School poets. A jazz musician, a former actor, an organizer, and an activist, he is the author of more than 30 books of poetry and prose. David Lehman has described Lally as a \u201cgregarious, theatrical, funny, sometimes pugnacious master of the contemporary American idiom.\u201d Frequently compared to Frank O\u2019Hara, Lally also taps into poetry\u2019s spiritual largesse in the manner of William Carlos Williams. Or as Lally himself put it, \u201cI\u2019m always attracted to Whitman as opposed to Eliot, Kerouac as opposed to Burroughs, who believed in the transcendent power of the human spirit\u2026My goal has been to talk to the kid I was when I was 14, 15, 16\u2014before I had any education, before I had read anything that sophisticated but still knew certain things in my heart.\u201d\nLally\u2019s collections include Stupid Rabbits (1971); White Life (1980); Cant Be Wrong: Poems 1985\u20131992 (1996), which won a PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Literary Award; It\u2019s Not Nostalgia (1999), winner of an American Book Award; Swing Theory (2015); and Another Way to Play: Poems 1960\u20132017 (2018). Poet Eileen Myles introduced Another Way to Play as \u201ca broken book in the best sense. There\u2019s no whole here, the self is never resolved, but what\u2019s delivered, weltered in poem form, is a novelistic series of impressions. It\u2019s a real thing and a changing thing. An aesthetic and a biographical one.\u201d Lally is the recipient of a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, among other honors. He lives in Maplewood, New Jersey.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"], "School/Period:": ["New York School (2nd Generation)"]}}
