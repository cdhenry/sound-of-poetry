She is the author of several collections of poetry, including Firefly under the Tongue: Selected Poems (2008), translated by poet Forrest Gander; Cuarto de hotel (2007); Ese espacio, ese jard\u00edn (2003), which won the Xavier Villaurrutia Prize; Tierra de entra\u00f1a ardiente (1992), a collaboration with painter Irma Palacios; and El ser que va a morir (1982). Bracho\u2019s impact on Mexican poetry has been compared to poet John Ashbery\u2019s influence on American verse. Bracho\u2019s layered, long-lined poems attend equally to sound patterns and lush, unspooling imagery. As Gander observes, \u201cHer diction spills out along ceaselessly shifting beds of sound. \u2026 Bracho\u2019s early poems make sense first as music, and music propels them.\u201d\nA selection of poems from her first two collections was included in the anthologies Medusario (1996, ed. Roberto Echavarren, Jos\u00e9 Kozer, and Jacobo Sefam\u00ed), Reversible Monuments: An Anthology of Contemporary Mexican Poetry (2002), and L\u00edneas Conectadas: nueva poes\u00eda de los Estados Unidos (Connecting Lines: New Poetry from Mexico, 2006, edited by\u00a0Luis Cort\u00e9s Bargall\u00f3 and Forrest Gander). Her poetry was translated for the Poetry Translation Center\u2019s 2005 World Poets\u2019 Tour by Tom Boll and poet Katherine Pierpoint.\u00a0\nBracho\u2019s honors include the Aguacalientes National Poetry Prize and a Guggenheim Fellowship.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Mexico"]}}
