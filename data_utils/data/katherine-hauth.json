Hauth grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan. After leaving a career as a personnel analyst in Seattle, she found herself drawn to the natural rhythms she encountered in the Southwest. \u201cThe longer I lived away from city noises and distractions, the more I found nature to be essentially poetic, but I don\u2019t mean that in a sentimental sense,\u201d Hauth explains in a 2011 author\u2019s statement on her publisher\u2019s website. \u201cI responded to its patterns, rhythms, sensuous qualities, hyperbole, and onomatopoeia. As I became more in tune with the land, it seemed natural to write its stories in the language of poetry. And so\u2014aided by reading poetry and taking poetry classes and workshops\u2014I became a poet.\u201d\nA 2010 writer for Kirkus Reviews described What\u2019s for Dinner? Quirky, Squirmy Poems from the Animal World (2011) as an \u201cenriching overview of the natural world spiced with a Dorothy Parker-esque sense of the macabre that children will absolutely relish,\u201d noting that some \u201cpoems look at the wildly diverse ways in which organisms lure or capture their prey; still others break down sophisticated concepts like symbiosis and parasitism in brilliantly accessible terms.\u201d\nHauth is also the author of Night Life of the Yucca: The Story of a Flower and a Moth (1996). She lives in Rio Rancho, New Mexico.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
