He earned a BA in Russian literature at Amherst College, an MA in Slavic languages and literature at the University of California, Berkeley, and an MFA in poetry at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.\r\n\u00a0\r\nZapruder\u2019s poems employ nuanced, conversational syntax to engage themes of grief, perception, and logic. As Dana Jennings noted in the\u00a0New York Times, Zapruder has a \u201crazor eye for the remnants and revenants of modern culture.\u201d Discussing his own development as a writer in the\u00a0Los Angeles Times,\u00a0Zapruder addressed the role of rhyme in his work: \u201c[T]he rhyme is what I would call \u2018conceptual,\u2019 that is, not made of sounds, but of ideas that accomplish what the sounds do in formal poetry: to connect elements that one wouldn't have expected, and to make the reader or listener, even if just for a moment, feel the complexity and disorder of life, and at the same time what\u00a0Wallace Stevens\u00a0called the \u2018obscurity of an order, a whole.\u2019\u201d\r\n\u00a0\nZapruder is the author of several collections of poetry, including Father\u2019s Day (2019), Sun Bear\u00a0(2014),\u00a0Come On All You Ghosts\u00a0(2010),\u00a0The Pajamaist\u00a0(2006), and\u00a0American Linden\u00a0(2002). He collaborated with painter Chris Uphues on\u00a0For You in Full Bloom\u00a0(2009) and cotranslated, with historian Radu Ioanid, Romanian poet Eugen Jebeleanu\u2019s last collection,\u00a0Secret Weapon: Selected Late Poems\u00a0(2008).\r\n\u00a0\r\nWith Brian Henry, Zapruder cofounded Verse Press, which later became Wave Books. As an editor for Wave Books, Zapruder coedited, with Joshua Beckman, the political poetry anthology\u00a0State of the Union: 50 Political Poems\u00a0(2008). His own poems have been included in the anthologies\u00a0Best American Poetry\u00a0(2013, 2009),\u00a0Third Rail: The Poetry of Rock and Roll\u00a0(2007), and\u00a0Legitimate Dangers: American Poets of the New Century\u00a0(2006), as well as\u00a0Poets on Teaching: A Sourcebook\u00a0(2010). He is also the author of Why Poetry (2017), a book of prose about reading poetry for a general audience.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZapruder\u2019s poetry has been adapted by some of America\u2019s most exciting young composers. In Fall, 2012, his poetry was adapted and performed at Carnegie Hall by Composer Gabriel Kahane and Brooklyn Rider. In February, 2014, composer Missy Mazzoli, along with Victoire and Glenn Kotche, performed Vespers for a New Dark Age, a piece commissioned\u00a0by Carnegie Hall for the 2014 Ecstatic Music Festival, and released as a recording on New Amsterdam records in spring, 2015.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZapruder\u2019s honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Lannan Foundation Residency Fellowship,\u00a0the William Carlos Williams Award from the Poetry Society of\u00a0America, and the May Sarton Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has taught at New York University, the New School, the University of California Riverside - Palm Desert Low Residency MFA Program, the University of Massachusetts, Amherst\u2019s Juniper Summer Writing Institute, and at the University of California at Berkeley as the Holloway Fellow.\n\u00a0\nHe lives in Oakland, where he is an associate professor in the Saint Mary\u2019s College of California MFA Program in Creative Writing, as well as editor at large for Wave Books. He is also a guitarist in the rock band The Figments.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
