His poems have also appeared in numerous magazines and journals, such as Poetry, the Nation, and the American Scholar, as well as on television, when he was featured on PBS\u2019s NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. He earned a BA from the University of Pennsylvania and MFA from Syracuse University.\nHis work explores, among other things, the private and public legacies of family, history, and culture, often through meditations on his own Armenian heritage and childhood emigration to the United States. His poems can be sad, revealing, and funny all at once; poet Stephen Dunn calls him \u201ca gardener of the human spirit\u201d whose poems \u201creplenish\u201d while offering readers \u201ca wonderful variety of tones.\u201d\n\r\nHis poems also investigate how language, especially the American idiom, is enriched or reinvented. He has a keen ear for what he calls the \u201cunexpected syntactic constructions\u201d and \u201csurprising turns of phrase\u201d that immigrants contribute to English. His honors and awards includes fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Eunice Tietjens Prize and Friends of Literature Prize, and the Anahid Literary Award from the Armenian Center at Columbia University. Born in Alexandria, Egypt, he now lives in Philadelphia, where he directs the creative writing program at the University of Pennsylvania.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
