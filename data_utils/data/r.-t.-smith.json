(Rod) Smith was born in Washington, DC, and grew up in Georgia and North Carolina.

He has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Virginia Commission for the Arts and has won the Cohen Prize from Ploughshares and a Pushcart Prize.\r\nThe South, the natural world, childhood, and the work of James Dickey are often cited as influences on Smith\u2019s poetry. In Poetry, Bill Christophersen commented, \u201cSmith uses a free verse as spare as a whittled stick to probe nature\u2019s and childhood\u2019s epiphanies and his Irish Catholic heritage.\u201d Smith also published several collections of short stories, including Uke River Delivers (2006) and The Calaboose Epistles: Stories (2009).\nSmith has taught at Auburn University and was coeditor of the Southern Humanities Review. Since 1995, he has been the editor of Shenandoah, the literary magazine from Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, where he is writer-in-residence in the Department of English.\nHe lives in Virginia with his wife, poet Sarah Kennedy, with whom he coedited Common Wealth: Contemporary Poets of Virginia (2003). \ufeff\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
