At the age of nine, he migrated to Egypt to join his father. He studied at al-Azhar and later in Moscow where he pursued post-graduate studies in arts. Rahman is regarded as one of the pioneers of the foot poem in the Arab world, which heralded a major departure from the ages-long traditional poetry. He is also credited with translating a large volume of Russian poetry into Arabic. He left behind two published and three unpublished collections. Some of his poems appeared in Modern Sudanese Poetry: An Anthology (University of Nebraska Press, 2019).\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Africa"]}}
