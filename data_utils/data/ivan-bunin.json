Born in Voronezh, Russia to a noble family that counted the poets Anna B\u00fanina and Vas\u00edly Zhukovsky among their ancestors, Bunin spent his early childhood in the rural Russian Provinces. He attended secondary school in Yelets, Russia but did not graduate for financial reasons.\u00a0Bunin published his first poem in a St. Petersburg magazine in 1887. In 1892 Bunin began working for\u00a0The Orlovsky Herald\u00a0and published his first book,\u00a0Poems: 1887-1891,\u00a0as a supplement to the newspaper. In the following decade, Bunin\u2019s popularity grew and he became friends with Anton Chekhov and other literary elite in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Bunin also became involved with the growing Russian Symbolist movement; his book of poetry\u00a0Falling Leaves\u00a0(1901) reflects this involvement. \u00a0 Bunin authored several important works of prose, including the short story collections\u00a0To the Edge of the World and Other Stories\u00a0(1897),\u00a0The Scent of Apples\u00a0(1900),\u00a0The Gentleman from San Francisco\u00a0(1916), and\u00a0Temple of the Sun\u00a0(1917); the novels\u00a0The Village\u00a0(1910) and\u00a0Dry Valley\u00a0(1912); and\u00a0Cursed Days\u00a0(1918-1920), his diary and notes detailing the Bolsheviks' rise to power. Bunin also translated several works from English to Russian, including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\u2019s The Song of Hiawatha\u00a0(1898).\u00a0 \u00a0 Bunin is the winner of the 1903 and 1909 Pushkin Prize. In 1909 he was elected to the Russian Academy. When Bunin won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1933 many considered him a crucial voice against Communism. Much of Bunin\u2019s writing celebrates the natural world and decries the divide between the intelligentsia and uncultured masses. His classical prose style recalls Leo Tolstoy, whom Bunin greatly admired. Bunin\u2019s verse is noted for its technical precision and artistry.\u00a0 \u00a0 Bunin disapproved of the Russian Revolution and immigrated to France in 1920. During this time, he published many works that made him one of the most popular \u00e9migr\u00e9 writers, including the short story collection Dark Avenues (1946), the novel Mitya\u2019s Love (1924), and the autobiographical novel The Life of Arseniev (1952). Bunin also wrote books on Chekhov and Tolstoy. Bunin split his time between Paris and the French Alps until his death in 1953.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Russia"]}}
