He earned a BA and an MA at Harvard University and was later awarded honorary doctorates from 22 universities.\u00a0McCord\u2019s poetic innovations include the invention of a five-line form he called \u201csymmetrics.\u201d Well-known as a children\u2019s writer, McCord spoke about writing children\u2019s poetry in a 1964 article for the New York Times: \u201cWhatever may be said about this small but graceful art, three things should be remembered: good poems for children are never trivial; they are never written without the characteristic chills and fever of a dedicated man at work; they must never bear the stigma of I am adult, you are a child.''\u00a0McCord authored and edited more than 50 books during his life. His collections of poetry include Oddly Enough (1926) as well as the children\u2019s collections Far and Few (1952); One at a Time: His Collected Poems for the Young (1974), which won the National Council of Teachers of English Award for Excellence in Poetry for Children; and Every Time I Climb a Tree (1967). He is also the author of the prose collections About Boston: Sight, Sound, Flavor & Inflection (1948), An Acre for Education: Being Notes on the History of Radcliffe College (1958), and In Sight of Sever: Essays from Harvard (1963). He edited the anthology of humorous British and American poetry What Cheer (1945, reprinted in 1946 as The Pocket Book of Humorous Verse).\u00a0McCord\u2019s honors include a grant from the National Institute of Arts and Letters and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Royal Society of Arts in London, and Marlboro College. The Framingham State College Curriculum Library and the Nobscot Reading Council of the IRA founded the annual David McCord Children\u2019s Literature Festival in 1986. \u00a0For 38 years, McCord served as executive director of the Harvard College Fund, where he helped raise millions of dollars. He was also an early editor of the Harvard Alumni Bulletin. He died at the age of 99 in Goddard House, a Boston nursing home.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
