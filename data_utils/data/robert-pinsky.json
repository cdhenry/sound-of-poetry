Often called the last of the \u201ccivic\u201d or public poets, Pinsky\u2019s criticism and verse reflect his concern for a contemporary poetic diction that nonetheless speaks of a wider experience. Elected Poet Laureate of the United States in 1997, his tenure was marked by ambitious efforts to prove the power of poetry\u2014not just as an intellectual pursuit in the ivory tower, but as a meaningful and integral part of American life. \u201cI think poetry is a vital part of our intelligence, our ability to learn, our ability to remember, the relationship between our bodies and minds,\u201d he told the Christian Science Monitor. \u201cPoetry\u2019s highest purpose is to provide a unique sensation of coordination between the intelligence, emotions and the body. It\u2019s one of the most fundamental pleasures a person can experience.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Sounds of Poetry is a slim volume that can serve as a primer on the mechanics of poetry and also as a \u201ctreatise on the social functions of poetry,\u201d according to James Longenbach in the Nation. Atlantic Monthly contributor David Barber noted that The Sounds of Poetry \u201cis an achievement for which there is surprisingly little precedent: an authoritative yet accessible introduction to the tools of the poet\u2019s trade that can be read with profit by the serious student and the amateur alike.\u201d Barber characterized the volume as \u201cless that of a solemn classroom lecture than that of a spirited audio tour, with Pinsky offering up various devices and motifs for inspection and providing a lively running commentary on how to fine-tune the ear to respond to the distinctive verbal energies that make poetry \u2018poetic.\u2019\u201c In Democracy, Culture and the Voice of Poetry, Pinsky resumes his examination of poetry\u2019s necessity to contemporary, democratic culture. Reviewing the book for The New Republic, David Bromwich wrote, \u201cOne is never in any doubt about the tendency of Pinsky\u2019s argument. He urges appreciation not of what the poet does in writing a poem, but of what the poet does in reading it. The poet mainly counts as one more reader. So, too, Pinsky\u2019s idea of the place of poetry in democratic culture comes from an image of someone reading a poem to an audience.\u201d\nCritics of Pinsky\u2019s first collection, Sadness and Happiness, compared the work to Ranier Marie Rilke, James Wright, and Robert Lowell. Yale Review contributor Louis L. Martz declared that \u201cPinsky is the most exhilarating new poet that I have read since A. R. Ammons entered upon the scene.\u201d Pinsky\u2019s second volume was the book-length poem, An Explanation of America. Like Robert Lowell, Pinsky attempted to understand American history through a comparison to ancient Rome. \u201cNot the least remarkable thing about Robert Pinsky\u2019s remarkable [book],\u201d stated Michael Hamburger in the Nation, \u201cis that it seems to defy not only all the dominant trends in contemporary poetry but all the dominant notions\u2014both American and non-American\u2014of what is to be expected of an American poet.\u201d \u201cIn its philosophical approach, classical learning, and orderly structure,\u201d remarked Hudson Review contributor James Finn Cotter, An Explanation of America \u201cresembles the work of William Cullen Bryant more than that of Hart Crane, but it is not old-fashioned. It is as American as Bryant\u2019s and Crane\u2019s long poems, as embedded in the past, and as identified with the woods and prairies.\u201d\nPinsky continued his examination of history\u2014sometimes national, sometimes personal\u2014in two later collections of poetry. \u201cHistory of My Heart\u201d observed J. D. McClatchy in the New Republic, \u201cwas Pinsky\u2019s breakthrough, and my guess is that it will come to be seen as one of the best books of the past decade.\u201d The best poems in Pinsky\u2019s 1990 collection, The Want Bone, according to McClatchy, \u201care more personal. They do not wrestle with religious angels or intellectual demons, the myths imposed on us by tradition. Instead, they address the self, those autobiographical myths we make out of memories.\u201d\n\nThe Figured Wheel: New and Collected Poems, 1966-1996 \u201cwill remind readers that here is a poet who, without forming a mini-movement or setting himself loudly at odds with the dominant tendencies of American poetry, has brought into it something new,\u201d maintained Katha Pollitt in the New York Times Book Review. Paul Breslin felt that The Figured Wheel \u201csignals a major turn in Pinsky\u2019s stylistic development.... [In] its hurling together of the apocalyptic and vast with the mundane and the particular, it fairly bristles with linguistic energy.\u201d Pollitt claimed: \u201cWhat makes Mr. Pinsky such a rewarding and exciting writer is the sense he gives, in the very shape and structure of his poems, of getting at the depths of human experience, in which everything is always repeated but also always new.\u201d\nPinsky\u2019s interest in poetry that mixed contemporary speech with wide-ranging subject matter led him in 1994 to publish a new translation of Dante\u2019s Inferno. He had been asked, with a group of nineteen other poets, to participate in a reading of the poem at the 92nd Street YMCA in New York City in May of 1993. Pinsky became fascinated with the work of the thirteenth-century Italian poet. Pinsky said in an interview with the New York Times Book Review,\u00a0\u201cThis was like being a child with a new toy. I called the translation a feat of metrical engineering, and I worked obsessively. It\u2019s the only writing I have ever done where it\u2019s like reading yourself to sleep each night. We have pillowcases stained with ink where my wife took the pen out of my hand at night.\u201d\nDespite the fact that about fifty English-language translations of the Inferno have been published in the 20th century alone, critics largely celebrated Pinsky\u2019s work. \u201cThe primary strength of this translation,\u201d declared Edward Hirsch, \u201cis the way it maintains the original\u2019s episodic and narrative velocity while mirroring its formal shape and character. It is no small achievement to reproduce Dante\u2019s rhyme scheme and at the same time sound fresh and natural in English, and Pinsky succeeds in creating a supple American equivalent for Dante\u2019s vernacular music where many others have failed.\u201d \u201cHis skill and power as a poet inform every line of this splendid translation,\u201d stated John Ahern in the New York Times Book Review. \u201cHe shapes sinewy lines whose edges you can actually hear. This is true verse, not the typographical arrangement of poetic prose... [I]f he does not quite attain Dante\u2019s full symphonic range, no one has come closer.\u201d\nPinsky was named poet laureate in 1997 and served until 2000. The position carries a modest stipend, but its appeal lies in its visibility to the general public. Formerly a retiring person, Pinsky became a public figure, and he used the notoriety to promote a new project. Under his direction, ordinary Americans were invited to name their favorite poems, and some entrants were asked to read for a permanent audio archive at the Library of Congress. Pinsky set a goal of recording one hundred people, but he was inundated with letters and e-mails from all over the nation, and those participating represented all ages, all walks of life, and all levels of education. \u201cThe Favorite Poem Project is partly to demonstrate that there is more circulation of poetry and more life of poetry than there might seem with the stereotype,\u201d Pinsky explained in the Progressive. \u201cI must say that the Favorite Poem readings, beyond my expectation, are very moving.\u201d\n\r\nWith Maggie Dietz, Pinsky edited a representative volume of reader responses called Americans\u2019 Favorite Poems: The Favorite Poem Project Anthology. A Publishers Weekly reviewer stated that \u201cthe selections are as diverse as the nation that chose them.\u201d Americans\u2019 Favorite Poems proved so popular that two subsequent collections have appeared: Poems to Read: A New Favorite Poem Project Anthology and An Invitation to Poetry: A New Favorite Poem Project Anthology. Booklist contributor Donna Seaman called Poems to Read \u201ca graceful, sometimes jubilant, sometimes lyrical, sometimes brooding, but always welcoming and stirring collection.\u201dJersey Rain, published in 2000, was Pinsky\u2019s first collection of completely new work since The Want Bone appeared a decade earlier. Reviewing the work in Library Journal, Christian Graham observed that Pinsky\u2019s poems range from the mythic to the confessional. \u201cOccasionally, his differing manners collide strangely,\u201d Graham stated, \u201cbut Pinsky delivers, as ever, intelligent, pensive poetry of great beauty.\u201d Pinsky\u2019s latest book, Gulf Music, was published to wide acclaim in 2007. In a review for the New York Times, Joel Brouwer wrote that the collection was \u201cnot just an argument for but a demonstration of contemporary poetry\u2019s necessity and vitality in our democracy.\u201d Citing Pinsky\u2019s influence as a critic and \u201cAmerican civic poet,\u201d Brouwer continued: \u201cPinsky is our finest living specimen of this sadly rare breed, and the poems of \u201cGulf Music\u201d are among the best examples we have of poetry\u2019s ability to illuminate not only who we are as humans, but who we are \u2014 and can be \u2014 as a nation.\u201d\n\r\nPaul Breslin has commented that Pinsky \u201chas emerged as the finest American poet-critic since Randall Jarrell\u201d; Joel Brouwer that \u201c[n]o other living American poet \u2014 no other living American, probably \u2014 has done so much to put poetry before the public eye.\u201d For his own part, the last American poet laureate of the 20th century told the Progressive: \u201cI think the rhythms in a lot of my writing are an attempt to create that feeling of a beautiful, gorgeous jazz solo that gives you more emotion and some more and coming around with some more, and it\u2019s the same but it\u2019s changed, and the rhythm is very powerful, but it is also lyricism. I think I\u2019ve been trying to create something like that in my writing for a long time.\u201d\n\u00a0\n[Updated 2010]\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
