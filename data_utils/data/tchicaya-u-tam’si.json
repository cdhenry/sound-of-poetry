U Tam\u2019si completed his education in Paris and Orl\u00e9ans.  \u00a0 U Tam\u2019si\u2019s poetry uses symbolism, dark humor, and surrealist, corporeal imagery to explore cultural identity in a politically unstable society. A member of the Congolese independence movement, U Tam\u2019si creates work on the nature of African identity that is sometimes connected to L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor\u2019s N\u00e9gritude movement, which advocated for the protection of a distinct African culture in the face of French colonialism and European exploitation. \u00a0 U Tam\u2019si published six collections of poetry during his lifetime: Le mauvais sang (1955), Feu de brousse (1957), \u00c0 triche-coeur (1958), Epitom\u00e9 (1962), Le Ventre (1964), and L\u2019arc Musical (1970). Epitom\u00e9 was awarded the 1966 Poetry Prize at the World Festival for Negro Arts. U Tam\u2019si also wrote the play Le Zulu (1977) and edited the anthology La veste d\u2019int\u00e9rieur (1977).  \u00a0 Translations of U Tam\u2019si\u2019s poetry into English include Brush Fire (1964, translated by Sangadore Akanji) and Selected Poems (1970, translated by Gerald Moore). Selections of his poems appear in the Penguin Book of Modern African Poetry (1999) and in The Negritude Poets: An Anthology of Translations from the French (1989). \u00a0 U Tam\u2019si served in Paris as UNESCO\u2019s educational representative for the Congo. He died in Oise, France. \ufeff\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"]}}
