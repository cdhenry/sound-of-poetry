She lived in New York City from 1985 until 1999.\nCiting Dylan Thomas and Kathleen Spivack as early influences, Duhamel writes both free verse and fixed-form poems that fearlessly combine the political, sexual, and ephemeral. Introducing Duhamel for Smartish Pace, poet Karla Huston observed, \u201cHer poems speak with a wild irreverence. \u2026\u00a0Duhamel experiments with form and subject, creating poetry that challenges the reader\u2019s notion of what poetry should be. She presents what poetry could be as she fully engages pop culture, the joys and horrors of it, while maintaining the ability to poke fun at our foibles\u2014and make us think.\u201d In an interview for Pif magazine with Derek Alger, Duhamel stated, \u201cAt some point in my development as a writer, I became interested in putting it all in, trusting my leaps, embracing vulnerability in imagery.\u201d\nDuhamel has published numerous collections of poetry, including Scald (2017),\u00a0Blowout (2013), which was a finalist for a National Books Critics Circle Award,\u00a0Ka-Ching! (2009), Queen for a Day: Selected and New Poems (2001),\u00a0and Kinky (1997). She coedited, with Nick Carb\u00f3, Sweet Jesus: Poems about the Ultimate Icon (2002), and, with Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad, Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry (2007). Duhamel has also collaborated with Seaton on several poetry collections, including Little Novels (2002),\u00a0Oyl (2000), and Exquisite Politics (1997).\nDuhamel\u2019s honors include a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. Her work has been included in several volumes of Best American Poetry, and has also been featured on National Public Radio\u2019s All Things Considered and Bill Moyers\u2019s PBS poetry special Fooling with Words.\nA professor at Florida International University, she lives in Florida.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
