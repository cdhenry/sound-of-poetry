According to the University of Notre Dame Press, the title is \u201ca homophonic translation of the Spanish word maquiladora, which translates into English as \u2018factory\u2019 or \u2018sweatshop.\u2019\u201d Mart\u00ednez Pompa\u2019s poems often focus on topics of race, language, consumerism, cultural identity, and masculinity. In 2008, poet Mart\u00edn Espada selected the collection to be the recipient of the Andrews Montoya Poetry Prize. Praising My Kill Adore Him, Espada noted that the poems are \u201cgritty and visceral, but never cross the line into sensationalism\u201d while they \u201cvividly evoke the urban world, especially Chicago, without ever lapsing into urban clich\u00e9.\u201d \u00a0 Mart\u00ednez Pompa\u2019s poetry and prose have also appeared in anthologies such as Telling Tongues: A [email\u00a0protected] Anthology on Language Experience (2007), and The Wind Shifts: New Latino Poetry (2007).
