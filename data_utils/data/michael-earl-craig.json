On the occasion of his 2003 inclusion in the Poetry Society of America\u2019s New American Poetry Series, Craig stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think you get to choose the direction you go in. Not really. You interpret lumps in the sandbox the same way now as you did when you were five. All one can do is drift\u2014or gravitate, if that\u2019s easier\u2014back toward\u2014or go, one could simply go\u2014back toward the very inner self, which was there, intact, at the outset.\u201d \u00a0\nCraig\u2019s poetry collections include Can You Relax in My House (2002),\u00a0Yes, Master (2006), Thin Kimono (2010), and Talkativeness (2014).\u00a0 His work has been included in the anthologies Isn\u2019t It Romantic (2004), Everyman\u2019s Library Poems About Horses (2009), and The Best American Poetry (2014). Craig lives near Livingston, Montana, where he works as a farrier.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
