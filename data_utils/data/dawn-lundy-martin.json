She is also the author of\u00a0Life in a Box is a Pretty Life\u00a0(Nightboat Books, 2015) and\u00a0Good Stock, Strange Blood\u00a0(Coffee House Press, 2017). Precise, tender, and unflinching, Martin\u2019s work is at once innovative and emotionally fraught. Fanny Howe described the poems in Discipline as \u201cdense and deep. They are necessary, and hot on the eye.\u201d\n\r\nWith Vivien Labaton, Martin coedited The Fire This Time: Young Activists and the New Feminism (2004). She also cofounded both the Third Wave Foundation and the post-theorist Black Took Collective. She has received the Academy of American Arts and Science\u2019s May Sarton Prize for Poetry as well as grants from the Massachusetts Cultural Council. Martin has taught at the University of Pittsburgh, The New School, and Bard College.\n", "attrs": {}}
