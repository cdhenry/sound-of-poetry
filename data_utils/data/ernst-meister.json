He enrolled in the University of Marburg as a theology student, but soon began attending the lectures of Karl L\u00f6with and Hans-Georg Gadamer, both of whom had studied with Martin Heidegger. Meister\u2019s first book of poetry Ausstellung (Exhibition) was published in 1932. After Adolf Hitler\u2019s rise to power, Meister stopped trying to publish his poetry, which was considered too abstract and experimental for the Third Reich. Meister served ingloriously in World War II, suffering from several protracted illnesses, injury, and eventual capture by the Americans in Italy. After his release, he returned to Hagen where he first worked for his father\u2019s company and then devoted himself full-time to writing. Meister published sixteen collections of poetry before his death, including Unterm schwarzen Schafspelz (Under Black Sheep\u2019s Clothing) (1953), though he never received the same level of recognition during his lifetime as his contemporaries Karl Krolow, G\u00fcnter Eich, or Paul Celan, to whom he is often compared. In fact, Meister was awarded Germany\u2019s most prestigious literary award, the Georg B\u00fcchner Prize, just a few days before his death.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe work of Heidegger was enormously influential on Meister, who has been described by his most recent translators, Graham Foust and Samuel Frederick, as having a \u201cpenchant for grand abstractions and philosophical concepts\u2026This persistently pulls his language into the realm of thinking, an activity made extraordinarily intense by the taut, afflicted space opened up by the poem, a space analogous to life.\u201d Foust and Frederick\u2019s translation of Meister\u2019s penultimate collection Im Zeitspalt (In Time\u2019s Rift) (1976) was published in 2012.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Germany"]}}
