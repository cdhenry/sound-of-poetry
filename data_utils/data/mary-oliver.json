Reviewing Dream Work (1986) for the Nation, critic Alicia Ostriker numbered Oliver among America\u2019s finest poets, as \u201cvisionary as [Ralph Waldo] Emerson.\u201d\n\r\nMary Oliver was born and raised in Maple Hills Heights, a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. She would retreat from a difficult home to the nearby woods, where she would build huts of sticks and grass and write poems. She attended both Ohio State University and Vassar College, but did not receive a degree from either institution. As a young poet, Oliver was deeply influenced by Edna St. Vincent Millay and briefly lived in Millay\u2019s home, helping Norma Millay organize her sister\u2019s papers. Oliver is notoriously reticent about her private life, but it was during this period that she met her long-time partner, Molly Malone Cook. The couple moved to Provincetown, Massachusetts, and the surrounding Cape Cod landscape has had a marked influence on Oliver\u2019s work. Known for its clear and poignant observations and evocative use of the natural world, Oliver\u2019s poetry is firmly rooted in place and the Romantic nature tradition. Her work received early critical attention; American Primitive (1983), her fifth book, won the Pulitzer Prize. According to Bruce Bennetin the New York Times Book Review, American Primitive, \u201cinsists on the primacy of the physical.\u201d Bennet commended Oliver\u2019s \u201cdistinctive voice and vision\u201d and asserted that the \u201ccollection contains a number of powerful, substantial works.\u201d Holly Prado of the Los Angeles Times Book Review also applauded Oliver\u2019s original voice, writing that American Primitive \u201ctouches a vitality in the familiar that invests it with a fresh intensity.\u201d\n\nDream Work (1986) continues Oliver\u2019s search to \u201cunderstand both the wonder and pain of nature\u201d according to Prado in a later review for the Los Angeles Times Book Review. Ostriker considered Oliver \u201camong the few American poets who can describe and transmit ecstasy, while retaining a practical awareness of the world as one of predators and prey.\u201d For Ostriker, Dream Work is ultimately a volume in which Oliver moves \u201cfrom the natural world and its desires, the \u2018heaven of appetite\u2019 ... into the world of historical and personal suffering. ... She confronts as well, steadily,\u201d Ostriker continued, \u201cwhat she cannot change.\u201d\n\r\nThe transition from engaging the natural world to engaging more personal realms was also evident in New and Selected Poems (1992), which won the National Book Award. The volume contains poems from eight of Oliver\u2019s previous volumes as well as previously unpublished, newer work. Susan Salter Reynolds, in the Los Angeles Times Book Review, noticed that Oliver\u2019s earliest poems were almost always oriented toward nature, but they seldom examined the self and were almost never personal. In contrast, Oliver appeared constantly in her later works. But as Reynolds noted \u201cthis self-consciousness is a rich and graceful addition.\u201d Just as the contributor for Publishers Weekly called particular attention to the pervasive tone of amazement with regard to things seen in Oliver\u2019s work, Reynolds found Oliver\u2019s writings to have a \u201cBlake-eyed revelatory quality.\u201d Oliver summed up her desire for amazement in her poem \u201cWhen Death Comes\u201d from New and Selected Poems: \u201cWhen it\u2019s over, I want to say: all my life / I was a bride married to amazement. / I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.\u201d\n\r\nOliver continued her celebration of the natural world in her next collections, including Winter Hours: Prose, Prose Poems, and Poems (1999), Why I Wake Early (2004), New and Selected Poems, Volume 2 (2004), and Swan: Poems and Prose Poems (2010). Critics have compared Oliver to other great American lyric poets and celebrators of nature, including Marianne Moore, Elizabeth Bishop, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and Walt Whitman. \u201cOliver\u2019s poetry,\u201d wrote Poetry magazine contributor Richard Tillinghast in a review of White Pine (1994) \u201cfloats above and around the schools and controversies of contemporary American poetry. Her familiarity with the natural world has an uncomplicated, nineteenth-century feeling.\u201d\u00a0\nA prolific writer of both poetry and prose, Oliver routinely published a new book every year or two. Her main themes continue to be the intersection between the human and the natural world, as well as the limits of human consciousness and language in articulating such a meeting. Jeanette McNew in Contemporary Literature described \u201cOliver\u2019s visionary goal,\u201d as \u201cconstructing a subjectivity that does not depend on separation from a world of objects. Instead, she respectfully conferred subjecthood on nature, thereby modeling a kind of identity that does not depend on opposition for definition. \u2026 At its most intense, her poetry aims to peer beneath the constructions of culture and reason that burden us with an alienated consciousness to celebrate the primitive, mystical visions that reveal \u2018a mossy darkness \u2013 / a dream that would never breathe air / and was hinged to your wildest joy / like a shadow.\u2019\u201d Her last books included A Thousand Mornings (2012), Dog Songs (2013), Blue Horses (2014), Felicity (2015), Upstream: Selected Essays (2016), and Devotions: The Selected Poems of Mary Oliver (2017).\nMary Oliver held the Catharine Osgood Foster Chair for Distinguished Teaching at Bennington College until 2001. In addition to such major awards as the Pulitzer and National Book Award, Oliver\u00a0 received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. She also won the American Academy of Arts & Letters Award, the Poetry Society of America\u2019s Shelley Memorial Prize and Alice Fay di Castagnola Award.\n\r\nOliver lived in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and Hobe Sound, Florida, until her death in early 2019. She was 83.\n", "attrs": {}}
