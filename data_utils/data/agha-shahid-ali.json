Ali wrote nine poetry collections and a book of literary criticism (T.S. Eliot as Editor, 1986), as well as translated a collection of Faiz Ahmed Faiz\u2019s poetry (The Rebel\u2019s Silhouette, 1992) and edited Ravishing DisUnities: Real Ghazals in English (2000), a collection of ghazals (a Persian poetic form employing repetition, rhyme, and couplets). Ali\u2019s collection, Rooms Are Never Finished (2001), was a finalist for the National Book Award in 2001; The Veiled Suite (2009), which contains selected works across the poet\u2019s career, was published posthumously. At the time of his death in 2001, Ali was noted as a poet uniquely able to blend multiple ethnic influences and ideas in both traditional forms and elegant free-verse. His poetry reflects his Hindu, Muslim, and Western heritages. In\u00a0Contemporary Poets,\u00a0critic Bruce\u00a0King remarked that Ali\u2019s poetry swirls around insecurity and \u201cobsessions [with] \u2026 memory, death, history, family ancestors, nostalgia for a past he never knew, dreams, Hindu ceremonies, friendships, and self-consciousness about being a poet.\u201d Known particularly for his dexterous allusions to European, Urdu, Arabic, and Persian literary traditions, Ali\u2019s poetry revolves around thematic and cultural poles.\nAli was born in New Delhi, India in 1949. He grew up in Kashmir, the son of a distinguished and highly educated family in Srinagar. He earned an MA from the University of Delhi, an MA and PhD from Pennsylvania State University, and an MFA from the University of Arizona. The recipient of numerous honors and awards, including Guggenheim and Ingram-Merrill fellowships, Ali had an active academic career. In 1987 he began teaching at Hamilton College in New York, and later moved to the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, where he served as the director of the MFA creative writing program. He also taught at the MFA Program for Writers at Warren Wilson College and was a visiting professor at Princeton University and in the Graduate Creative Writing Program at New York University.\nThough Ali began publishing in the early 1970s, it was not until\u00a0A Walk Through the Yellow Pages\u00a0(1987) that he received widespread recognition. Bruce King characterized the book as \u201ca surreal world of nightmare, fantasy, incongruity, wild humor, and the grotesque. Although the existential anxieties have their source in problems of growing up, leaving home, being a migrant, and the meeting of cultures, the idiom is American and contemporary.\u201d Ali\u2019s next book,\u00a0A Nostalgist\u2019s Map of America\u00a0(1991),\u00a0relates a series of travels through landscapes often blurred between his current American home and memories of his boyhood in Kashmir. King contended that such \u201cimagination links past and present, America and India, Islamic and American deserts, American cities and former American Indian tribes, modern deserts and prehistoric oceans,\u201d adding \u201cthere is a highly profiled language of color, paradoxes, oxymora, and other means to lift the poems into the lyrical and fanciful.\u201d Over the course of his writing career, Ali was influenced by the work of Urdu poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz, and translated a collection of Faiz\u2019s works, The Rebel\u2019s Silhouette, in 1992. In his own poetry, Ali frequently alludes to Faiz\u2019s work. Joseph Donahue, reviewing\u00a0The Veiled Suite, commented that \u201cthrough those translations, Ali first challenged the poetry of our moment, and they resonate profoundly with the personal and cultural devastations he documents in his own life. Some of the finest lines in\u00a0The Veiled Suite\u00a0can be read as a response to \u2026 Faiz\u2019s.\u201d\n\u00a0Ali\u2019s next books were widely praised. The poem originally called \u201cKashmir Without a Post Office\u201d was published as the title poem in\u00a0The Country Without a Post Office\u00a0(1997). Taking its impetus from the 1990 Kashmiri uprising against India, which led to political violence and closed all the country\u2019s post offices for seven months, Ali\u2019s long poem is considered one of his masterpieces. Joseph Donahue, reviewing Ali\u2019s posthumous collected volume\u00a0The Veiled Suite\u00a0(2009) for\u00a0Bookforum, described\u00a0The Country Without a Post Office\u00a0as \u201cthe first of the two volumes that form the peak of his achievement.\u201d In the book, Donahue explained, \u201cthe poet envisions the devastation of his homeland, moving from the realm of the personal to an expansive poetry that maintains an integrity of feeling in the midst of political violence and tragedy. Kashmir is vividly evoked, all the more so for retaining an element of the fantastic.\u201d Built on association and repetition rather than straightforward narrative logic, \u201cThe Country Without a Post Office\u201d is filled with recurring phrases and images. Ali dedicated it to his life-long friend\u00a0James Merrill. \u00a0Poet\u00a0Mark Doty described Merrill\u2019s influence on Ali\u2019s poems \u201cnot only in terms of their formal elegance but in the way that a resonant, emotional ambiguity allows the poet to simultaneously celebrate love and lament a landscape of personal and public losses.\u201d\nRooms Are Never Finished\u00a0(2001) similarly yokes political and personal tragedy, again with a long poem as its focal point. Ali used a line from\u00a0Emily Dickinson\u00a0as the title for \u201cAmherst to Kashmir,\u201d a poem that explores his grief at his mother\u2019s death and his own continued sense of exile from his home and culture. Noting how Ali continually stitches his work from cultural, political and personal events, Donahue described the poem as \u201ca cultural inquiry as well as a personal lament. Ali threads the story of the martyrdom of the Shia hero Hussain throughout his elegy, keeping the history and hope of transcendental violence always before us, drawing strength from the strain of esoteric Islam that runs through his work.\u201d \u00a0\nAli was also a noted writer of ghazals. As editor of\u00a0Ravishing Disunities: Real Ghazals in English\u00a0(2000), he described the long history of Western writers\u2019 fascination with ghazals, as well as offering a succinct, theoretical reading of the form itself. In his introduction he wrote, \u201cThe ghazal is made up of couplets, each autonomous, thematically and emotionally complete in itself\u2026 once a poet establishes the scheme\u2014with total freedom, I might add\u2014she or he becomes its slave. What results in the rest of the poem is the alluring tension of a slave trying to master the master.\u201d Ali\u2019s own book of ghazals,\u00a0Call Me Ishmael Tonight\u00a0(2003), frequently references American poets and other poems, creating a further layer of allusive tension. The poet\u00a0Michael Palmer\u00a0alleged that Ali\u2019s \u201cghazals offer a path toward a level of lyric expansiveness few poets would dare to aspire to.\u201d The scholar Amardeep Singh has described Ali\u2019s style in general as \u201cghazalesque,\u201d referring to Ali\u2019s frequent use of the form as well as his blending of the \u201crhythms and forms of the Indo-Islamic tradition with a distinctly American approach to storytelling. Most of his poems are not abstract considerations of love and longing,\u201d Singh noted, \u201cbut rather concrete accounts of events of personal importance (and sometimes political importance).\u201d\nAgha Shahid Ali died of brain cancer on December 8, 2001 in Amherst, Massachusetts. Poet Donald Hall edited and provided the forward for The Veiled Suite, posthumously published in 2009. In a review of the volume, Mark Doty concluded that \u201cAli so thoroughly inhabits his exile, in this haunting life\u2019s work, that he makes of it\u2014both for his own spirit and for his readers\u2014a dwelling place.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Asia, South"]}}
