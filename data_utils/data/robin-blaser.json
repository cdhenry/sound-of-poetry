With poets Robert Duncan and Jack Spicer, he helped spark the Berkeley Poetry Renaissance in the 1940s that preceded the San Francisco poetry renaissance of the 1950s and 1960s. In 1965, Blaser met Robert Creeley and Charles Olson, with whom he later worked closely. Miriam Nichols, editor of Blaser's collected poems, writes of Blaser in The Literary Encyclopedia, \u201cAn immigrant to Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1966, and a Canadian citizen [as of] 1972, Blaser \u2026 established himself as a key figure on the west coast of B.C. and an important influence among Canadian experimental poets such as George Bowering, Steve McCaffery, bp Nichol, Erin Mour\u00e9, and Daphne Marlatt.\u201dBlaser\u2019s expansive poetry explores the intersections of time, nature, and syntax. In a 2007 interview, Blaser said, \u201cLanguage is a way in which you are never simply yourself. I think the attachment to language, and I think as a writer, my attachment and those poets I\u2019ve admired so much in my life were all poets TIED IN with the language something so alive that it was close to having a body.\u201dBlaser is the author of numerous collections of poetry, including The Moth Poem (1964), Cups (1968), Syntax (1983), and Nomad (1995). Blaser\u2019s poetry and prose has been collected into three volumes: The Holy Forest: Collected Poems of Robin Blaser (2007); The Fire: Collected Essays of Robin Blaser (2006), edited by Miriam Nichols; and Even on Sunday: Essays, Readings, and Archival Materials on the Poetry and Poetics of Robin Blaser (2002).He edited The Collected Books of Jack Spicer (1975), George Bowering\u2019s Particular Accidents: Selected Poems (1980), and Louis Dudek\u2019s Infinite Worlds: The Poetry of Louis Dudek (1988). Blaser also published numerous essays and translations, and in 2000 his libretto for Harrison Birtwistle\u2019s The Last Supper, an opera in response to the AIDS epidemic, premiered in Berlin.In 2006 Blaser received the Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry\u2019s Lifetime Recognition Award. Two years later, The Holy Forest garnered the 2008 Griffin Poetry Prize. As summarized on the Trust\u2019s web site, \u201cBlaser\u2019s passion for word making draws inspiration from the major poets and philosophers of our time\u2014from friends and peers such as Robert Duncan, Jack Spicer and Steve McCaffery to virtual companions in thought such as Hannah Arendt, Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida, among others.\u201d Blaser worked as a librarian at Harvard University, the California Historical Society, and San Francisco State. He was Professor Emeritus of Simon Fraser University, where he began teaching in 1966. Granted Canadian citizenship in 1972, Blaser received the Order of Canada in 2005, Canada's \u201chighest civilian honour,\u201d awarded for a \u201clifetime of outstanding achievement, dedication to the community and service to the nation.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Canada"]}}
