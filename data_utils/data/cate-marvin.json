Morton Prize in Poetry,\u00a0Fragment of the Head of a Queen\u00a0(2007), and\u00a0Oracle\u00a0(2015). Marvin coedited, with Michael Dumanis, the anthology\u00a0Legitimate Dangers: American Poets of the New Century\u00a0(2006).\u00a0\nMarvin uses her work to explore how English language literary traditions butt up against American English in forms traditional and innovative, narrative and lyrical. Issues of gender and violence are of primary concern throughout her three volumes of poems.\u00a0As such, she\u00a0is interested in how American identity collides with the English language, focusing heavily on language play and on the intersection of identity, language, and the natural landscape.\n\r\nIn 2009 Marvin\u00a0co-founded VIDA: Women in the Literary Arts (with poets Erin Belieu and Ann Townsend), an organization that seeks to \u201cexplore critical and cultural perceptions of writing by women\u201d in contemporary culture.\u00a0Her many honors include the Kate Tufts Discovery Prize (2002), a Whiting Award (2007), and Guggenheim Fellowship (2015). Marvin has taught poetry at Lesley University\u2019s Low-Residency MFA program and is professor of creative writing at the College of Staten Island,\u00a0CUNY. She will be a visiting professor at Colby College during the 2016-17 academic year.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
