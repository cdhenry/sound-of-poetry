From 1968 to 1970, he was a Christian Brother at LaSalle College in Philadelphia. He left LaSalle and moved to Washington, DC, where he participated in the Mass Transit poetry readings. In the late 1970s, he moved to New York City and was active in the Lower East Side literary scene, where he was a contributing editor to Christopher Street magazine and on the Poetry Project staff.Dlugos\u2019s books of poetry include High There (1973), Je Suis Ein Americano (1979), Incredible Risks (1980), Entre Nous (1981), A Fast Life (1982), Strong Place (1992), Powerless: Selected Poems 1973\u20131990 (1995), and the posthumous A Fast Life: Poems of Tim Dlugos (2011), edited by David Trinidad. Marked by witty observation, narratives that recount life\u2019s daily minutia, and heavily enjambed lines, Dlugos\u2019s poetry shares its immediate, offhand style with the work of Frank O\u2019Hara and James Schuyler. Dlugos\u2019s work is also noteworthy for its firsthand depiction of the AIDS pandemic.Dlugos\u2019s poetry inspired the 2011 collaboration with painter Philip Monaghan titled At Moments Like These He Feels Farthest Away, which paired Monaghan\u2019s work with the Dlugos poem \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d and was shown at New York University\u2019s Fales Library.After learning that he was HIV positive, Dlugos studied at Yale University Divinity School to become an Episcopalian priest. He died of AIDS-related complications in 1990.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
