She was the recipient of fellowships from the NEA and the Guggenheim Foundation, as well as awards from the American Poetry Review and the Academy of American Arts and Letters.\n\r\nIn an interview with Carol Maso for BOMB magazine in 1995, she said\u00a0that her \u201ctheory is that a poem is troubled into its making. It\u2019s not a thing that blooms; it\u2019s a thing that wounds.\u201d This theory bears itself out in her collections, A Hunger (1988), The Master Letters (1995),\u00a0Trouble in Mind (2004), and Stay, Illusion (2013), which often explore obsessions and anxieties (of influence, ritual, mortality, and modernity), and which use whatever is available to create vivid, sometimes disorienting, portraits of mind. Stay, Illusion was a finalist for the National Book Award and the National Books Critics Circle Award.\n\r\nHer poetry is also marked by its shifting syntax and diction, and the ability to sound entirely original while at the same time paying homage to her influences\u2014themselves often the touchstones of her poems, as with Emily Dickinson and Wallace Stevens. In a review of Trouble in Mind for the New York Times, Maureen N. McLane described\u00a0Brock-Broido as always seeming \u201cto approach her life as an allegorical one: alchemized . . . into poetry.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
