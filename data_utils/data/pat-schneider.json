She received her MFA from the University of Massachusetts, and founded Amherst Writers & Artists, a non-profit corporation which sponsors outreach writing workshops and retreats for \u201ctraditionally silenced populations,\u201d including low-income women and children.\n\r\nSchneider\u2019s collections of poetry include White River Junction (1987), Long Way Home (1993), Olive Street Transfer (1999), and The Patience of Ordinary Things (2003). Her work has appeared in many anthologies including Family Reunion (2003), There\u2019s No Place Like Home for the Holidays (1997), and Alphabestiary (1995).\n\r\nSchneider\u2019s poetry often explores racial and class-related issues in realistic scenarios. Don Junkins, while reviewing her book, Another River: New and Selected Poems, writes: \u201cPat Schneider\u2019s poems cut through to the real world\u2026She not only knows how to write, seemingly without effort, articulate and precise lies, she\u2019s lean in language and abundant in content. Hers is a genuine voice expressed in informed craft, which to be really effective includes the management of tone, which itself depends entirely on the management of restraint.\u201d\n\r\nSchneider has received major grants from the Massachusetts Cultural Council and from the National Endowment for the Arts. She is also the recipient of a Danforth Foundation Grant and a Massachusetts Fellowship Program Award.\n\r\nSchneider has taught at the University of Massachusetts, the University of Connecticut, Smith College and is an adjunct faculty member at the Graduate Theological Union and Pacific School of Religion. She resides in Amherst, Massachusetts with her husband.\n", "attrs": {}}
