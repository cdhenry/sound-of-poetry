A master chess player by age ten, he also played mandolin and piano before turning his energies to poetry. \u00a0 One of the first American poets to embrace free verse and prose poetry, Kreymborg later returned to strict formal verse, making his work\u2014at once political and imagistic\u2014difficult to classify as a whole. He published more than a dozen collections of poetry during his lifetime, including the prose-poetry collection Apostrophes (1910), Mushrooms (1916), Manhattan Men (1929), Ten American Ballads (1942), and No More War and Other Poems (1950) as well as the autobiography Troubadour (1925). His verse and radio plays include Lima Beans (1918), The Planets: A Modern Allegory (1938), and The Four Apes (1939). \u00a0 Kreymborg edited a series of literary magazines over the course of his career, often working in collaboration with some of Modernism\u2019s most influential figures. With Man Ray, he published The Glebe, a Modernist journal that first published Ezra Pound\u2019s Des Imagistes, and with Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, and Skipwith Cannell, he edited Others: A Magazine of New Verse. He edited Broom: An International Magazine of the Arts with Harold Loeb and founded the annual anthology American Caravan with Paul Rosenfeld. \u00a0 Kreymborg\u2019s work as an editor, a historian, and an anthologist undeniably helped shape perceptions of the early Modernist movement. His comprehensive history of American poetry, Our Singing Strength (1929), offers particular insight into the community of Modernist poets.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"], "School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
