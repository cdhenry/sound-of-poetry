Ruth Padel described Sampson\u2019s style in the Guardian: \u201cThe tone is controlled and lightly pitched; there is a lovely surface smoothness with the rough.\u201d The attention to the aural qualities of poetry has also made its way into her essays: Music Lessons: The Newcastle Poetry Lectures (2011) and On Listening (2007).\nSampson\u2019s academic studies led to a concentration on the connection of writing to health, and she is a founding member of Lapidus, the Association for Literary Arts in Personal Development. She has published scholarly works and works for general readers on the subject of writing and health care, among them Writing: Self and Reflexivity, with Celia Hunt (2006); the edited guide Creative Writing in Health and Social Care (2004); The Healing Word (1999); and The Self on the Page: Theory and Practice of Creative Writing in Personal Development (1998). She also published the writing manual Poetry Writing: The Expert Guide (2009). \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nSampson\u2019s translations and edited works have focused on poets from central and southeastern Europe.
