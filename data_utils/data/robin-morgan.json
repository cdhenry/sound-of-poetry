Morgan co-founded the Women\u2019s Media Center and founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute.

Christine Stenstrom, reviewing Upstairs in the Garden: Poems Selected and New (1991), recognized the \u201cwit and irony of John Donne\u201d in Morgan\u2019s love poems, adding, \u201cAs a vindication and celebration of the female experience, these inventive poems successfully wed feminist rhetoric with vivid imagery and sensitivity to the music of language.\u201d Morgan has received a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts for her poetry.\n\r\nMorgan is the editor of several influential anthologies, among them Sisterhood Is Powerful (1970), Sisterhood Is Global (1984, 1996), and Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003).
