As president during the Civil War, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation and delivered the Gettysburg Address in 1863. He was re-elected as president in 1864 and served until his assassination in 1865, a few weeks after the Civil War ended.  \u00a0 Lincoln wrote poetry as a teenager, mostly satirical verse and short stanzas on the flyleaves of books. He worked on a longer poem in quatrains in 1846, \u201cMy Childhood Home I See Again,\u201d which he sent in a letter to Andrew Johnston, a fellow lawyer in Illinois. In 1863, Lincoln wrote lines of verse on the occasion of Lee\u2019s invasion of the North. In a 2004 article for the Abraham Lincoln Association\u2019s newsletter, Richard Lawrence Miller attributed an unsigned poem titled \u201cThe Suicide\u2019s Soliloquy\u201d to Lincoln. The poem, a melodramatic persona poem, originally appeared in the Sangamo Journal, a Springfield, Illinois, newspaper, in 1838. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
