She was raised in Austin\u2019s rural outskirts, where \u201cthe only art around was film,\u201d Conoley recalled during a 2010 conversation with Sara Mumulo for The Offending Adam. This early exposure to film would influence her writing: \u201cFilm was my first experience of art. As a writer, I envy film\u2019s ability to immediately draw us in to a world that looks so much like the one we walk in.\u201d\n\r\nConoley\u00a0is the author of seven collections of poetry, including Peace (2014), The Plot Genie (2009), Profane Halo (2005), Lovers In The Used World (2001), and Tall Stranger (1991), a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award.\u00a0Her poetry engages the act of narrative sourcing with a dimensional, layered approach to the relationship between the poetic line and the page. Reviewing Peace in The Journal, Sonja James writes,\u00a0\u201cEmbracing an unsparing postmodern sensibility, [Conoley] wages her argument for \u2018peace\u2019 in poems that are innovative and effective.\u00a0These poems ably demonstrate that the moral responsibility of the avant-garde is not only to heighten and rework our aesthetic perceptions but also to act as defender of what is most noble about the human race.\u201d\u00a0Her work has been featured in many anthologies, including American Hybrid: A Norton Anthology of New Poetry (2009), Lyric Postmodernisms: An Anthology of Contemporary Innovative Poetries (2008), and Best American Poetry (1997).\u00a0Her translations of Henri Michaux, collected in\u00a0Thousand Times Broken: Three Books by Henri Michaux (2014), had never been brought into English before.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nConoley earned a BA in journalism at Southern Methodist State University and an MFA at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. She is founder and editor of the long-standing journal\u00a0Volt,\u00a0whose oversize pages allow for an expansion of poetic form.\u00a0Her honors include American Poetry Review\u2019s Jerome J. Shestack Prize, several Pushcart Prizes, and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and two Fund for Poetry awards. She has served as professor and poet-in-residence at Sonoma State University and has previously taught at the University of Denver, the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, and Vermont College.\u00a0\n\r\nConoley lives with her husband, novelist Domenic Stansberry, just north of San Francisco.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
