I. Mechnikov National University, in part because she feared the humanities were compromised by communist ideology. Rejecting overtures from the KGB, she taught physics and math at a primary school before being fired for criticizing the school\u2019s anti-Semitic policies. In 1980, Ratushinskaya and her husband, Igor Gerashchenko, began to protest the Soviet Union\u2019s human rights violations in earnest, and Ratushinskaya\u2019s poetry began appearing in samizdat journals.\n\r\nIn 1982, she was arrested on charges of \u201canti-Soviet agitation and propaganda\u201d and sentenced to seven years of forced labor. She served three years in brutally harsh conditions, including long periods in the \u201csmall zone,\u201d a prison within the prison reserved for political prisoners. Ratushinskaya wrote poems on bars of soap so she could quickly wash them away if caught. She also memorized the lines to write down on cigarette papers later. Many of her poems were smuggled out of prison this way. Enormous international outrage and Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s glasnost policy led to Ratushinskaya\u2019s release in 1986.\n\r\nHer collections of poetry published in English include Beyond the Limit (translated by Frances Padorr Brent and Carol J. Avins, 1987) and Pencil Letter (1989). Her autobiographical account of her time in prison, Grey Is the Color of Hope (1988), was an international bestseller. She also published the memoir In the Beginning (1991) and the novel Fictions and Lies (translated by Alyona Kojevnikova, 1999). In 1988, Sally Beamish composed the cycle No, I\u2019m Not Afraid, based on Ratushinskaya\u2019s poems, for chamber orchestra.\n\r\nRatushinskaya served as poet-in-residence at Northwestern University from 1987\u20131989. She continued to write poems and television scripts after returning to Moscow in 1998 with her husband and twin sons.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Russia"]}}
