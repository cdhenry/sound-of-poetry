Although she followed her father\u2019s lead not only in choosing poetry as her life\u2019s work but also in the traditional style of poetry she chose to write, the themes of her work are often critical of the upper classes and the social injustice their privilege levied upon others. This characteristic was not present in her early work, including her first two books of poems\u2014Charitessi (1911) and Verses (1916)\u2014published under the name Elizabeth Bridges while she was still in her 20s. According to John Finlay, writing in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Daryush\u2019s \u201cearly poetry is preoccupied with rather conventional subject matter and owes a great deal to the Edwardians.\u201d\nAfter she married Ali Akbar Daryush in her mid-30s and lived in Persia for four years, Elizabeth Daryush\u2019s poetry took a subtle though marked departure from her early work. Finlay observed that \u201cThe Last Man (1936) suggests a new awareness on her part of the anguish and pain caused by the profound changes that transformed English social life during the 1930s.\u201d Yvor Winters, writing in American Review, noted that \u201cshe seems to be increasingly conscious \u2026 of social injustice, of the mass of human suffering.\u201d It was also with The Last Man that Daryush began to refine the stylistic experiments her father had undertaken with syllabic meter.\nRobert Bridges had argued that the form of traditional English poetry, with its emphasis on regular accented meter, had served its purpose, and that something new was needed. He attempted to write poems in which the meter of individual lines was bound not by regular accented syllables but merely the number of syllables in each line, thus leaving the emphasis up to the reader. Daryush took her father\u2019s experiment a step farther by making it less experimental; whereas Bridges\u2019 syllable count was a visual one, including unpronounced clusters of letters, Daryush\u2019s was strictly aural, counting only those syllables that were actually sounded when the poem was read aloud. It is for her successful experiments with syllabic meter that Daryush is best known to contemporary readers.\nIn comparing the poetry of Elizabeth Daryush to that of her contemporaries, John Matthias once offered this analogy: \u201cElizabeth Daryush ... [appears] rather like someone who has suddenly stepped out of the wrong century to find herself at the wrong party wearing the wrong clothes. There she stands in her brocades speaking her o\u2019ers and \u2019twixts and \u2019tweens in her very proper accent. ... But the effect of her presence is curious. Suddenly everyone\u2019s language sounds indecorous, full of improprieties and vulgarities.\u201d Jan Schreiber of the Southern Review agreed that Daryush\u2019s \u201cdiction is often that of ladies\u2019 magazines of the nineteenth century.\u201d However, Schreiber found that the poet\u2019s \u201cbest writing is independent of [this characteristic]. It comes from a kind of moral vision attainable by the poet only in response to a fairly clear-cut situation. ... When the theme is undisguised and of straightforward human concern, the words come right and confound criticism.\u201d\nBeyond its social content, Daryush\u2019s work is also recognized for a consistent and well-defined personal vision. As Finlay noted, \u201cFor her \u2026 poetry always dealt with the \u2018stubborn fact\u2019 of life as it is, and the only consolations it offered were those of understanding and a kind of half-Christian, half-stoical acceptance of the inevitable.\u201d However, he also argued that Daryush\u2019s best poems transcend such fatalism, \u201cdealing with the moral resources found in one\u2019s own being \u2026 and a recognition of the beauties in the immediate, ordinary world around us.\u201d\nIn his introduction to Daryush\u2019s Collected Poems (1976), Donald Davie wrote, \u201cWhen an unprejudiced literary history of our century comes to be written, our failure to recognize Elizabeth Daryush will be one of the most telling and lamentable charges that can be laid at our door.\u201d In contrast, Richard Ellmann stated in Poetry, \u201cLiving in an age when the poet\u2019s first duty has been to find an appropriate language, [Daryush] has avoided the problem by using a language that is dead. Her accomplishments have been chiefly technical, and these in themselves are not enough.\u201d Finlay has an explanation for such diverse reactions to Daryush\u2019s work. While granting that the \u201cdefects of her poetry are a diction often unnecessarily archaic and a frequently melodramatic use of personified abstractions,\u201d he went on to note that \u201cthese defects will irritate only those readers so committed to the Pound-Eliot revolution in poetic style that they refuse to see virtue in any other poetry than that modern and imagistic.\u201d He concluded, \u201cFor readers who wish to explore the full range of English poetry, such defects should not blind them to the obvious excellence of the poetry of Elizabeth Daryush, its thematic sturdiness and the subtle kind of music she was able to achieve in syllabic meter.\u201d\nDaryush died on April 7, 1977, at the age of 90.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
