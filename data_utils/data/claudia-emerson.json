Of the collection Late Wife (2005), poet Deborah Pope observed, \u201cLike the estranged lover in one of her poems who pitches horseshoes in the dark with preternatural precision, so Emerson sends her words into a different kind of darkness with steely exactness, their arc of perception over and over striking true.\u201d\nEmerson\u2019s volumes of poetry include Pharaoh, Pharaoh (1997); Pinion: An Elegy (2002); Late Wife (2005), which won the Pulitzer Prize;\u00a0Figure Studies\u00a0(2008); and Secure the Shadow (2012).\nHer honors include two additional Pulitzer Prize nominations as well as fellowships from the Library of Congress, the Virginia Commission for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Arts.
