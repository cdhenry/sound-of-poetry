He started the DRUNK/Metaphysical Drinking blog with Kendra Grant Malone. A site where writers could post poems, the blog led to the publication of Bailey\u2019s first collection of poems, The Drunk Sonnets (2009).\u00a0The Drunk Sonnets is a collection of 53 loose sonnets that toy with notions of sincerity, surrealism, and intoxication. Erin McNellis, reviewing the collection on her blog Uncomplicatedly, noted, \u201cDrunk poetry as written by Bailey and friends \u2026 breaks down the pervasive assumption that experimental form is incompatible with emotional content.\u201d\nBailey\u2019s other collections include Gather Me (2013) and Hallelujah, Giant Space Wolf (2012). He lives and teaches in Athens, Georgia.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
