He was awarded the Stalin Peace Prize in 1954 and the Cuban Order of Jose Marti by Fidel Castro in 1981. In 1983, he was the inaugural honoree of Cuba\u2019s Natopnal Prize for Literature. Most notably, Guill\u00e9n was named National Poet of Cuba and appointed to the National Cuban Writer\u2019s Union in 1961, serving as president for more than 25 years.\nGuill\u00e9n read widely during his youth and worked as a typesetter to support his mother and five siblings when his father, a journalist and liberal senator, was assassinated by government forces in 1917. His first poems, discussing social problems he witnessed in his community, were published in the Camaguey Grafico when the author was still in high school. Planning to become a journalist and politician like his father, Guill\u00e9n enrolled in the University of Havana in 1921 with plans to study law; he left school after one year to begin working on his career as a poet and essayist.\nMotivos de son (1930), Guill\u00e9n\u2019s first published collection of poetry was a revolutionarily realistic account of Black life in Havana\u2019s slums. \u201cThe collection's socially complex and critically compassionate monologues,\u201d writes Roberto M\u00e1rquez in the Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History, \u201cbrought unwonted, strikingly new dimensions to the shades of exoticism more typical of the\u00a0negrista\u00a0movement then coming into vogue.\u201d His next collections, S\u00f3nogro cosongo (1931), West Indies Ltd. (1934), and Cantos para soldados y sones para turistas (1937) reflect his growing commitment to his politics. His other major collections include El son entero (1947), his several Eleg\u00edas (1948-58), and La Paloma de vuelo popular (1958), decry racial oppression and colonial practices. He spoke in favor of reform throughout his career and, as a result, was arrested multiple times and exiled from Cuba during Fulgencio Batista\u2019s regime in the 1950s. Guillen supported the 1959 Cuban Revolution, which became a central theme in his later collections, such as Tengo (1964). A bilingual edition of his poems, Man-making Words: Selected Poems of Nicol\u00e1s Guillen, was published in 1975; another bilingual edition, Nueva poesia de amor: En algun sitio de la primavera or \u00a0New Love Poetry: In Springtime was posthumously published in 1994. \nToward the end of his life, he was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease; Guill\u00e9n died at age 87 on July 16, 1989. Richard Gott, writing for\u00a0The Guardian\u00a0of London, praised Guill\u00e9n for creating \"an atmosphere in which black people as a whole become fully integrated into Cuban society.\"\n", "attrs": {}}
