He studied under Seamus Heaney and Lucie Brock-Broido at Harvard University and, while a student there, became a member of the Dark Room Collective, a community of African American writers. He was awarded a Stegner Fellowship from Stanford University and later earned an MFA from Brown University. He is the author of many books of poetry, including Brown (2018), Blue Laws: Selected & Uncollected Poems 1995\u20132015, and Book of Hours (2014). Three of Young\u2019s books form what he calls \u201can American trilogy\u201d: To Repel Ghosts (2001), which explores the paintings of Jean-Michel Basquiat; Jelly Roll (2003), a collection of blues poems; and Black Maria (2005), a film noir. His first book of poetry, Most Way Home (1995), was selected for the National Poetry Series by Lucille Clifton, who describes the collection as re-creating \u201can inner history which is compelling and authentic and American.\u201d Reviewing Young\u2019s work in 2007, critic Amy Guth largely agrees with Clifton, and adds, \u201cPerhaps the most noticeable characteristic of Young\u2019s work ... is the musical quality so fundamentally ingrained and supplied to each piece.\u201d\nYoung\u2019s other collections of poetry include Book of Hours (2014), winner of the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize; Ardency: A Chronicle of the Amistad Rebels (2011), which won the Before Columbus Foundation American Book Award; Dear Darkness (2008); and For the Confederate Dead (2007), which won the Quill Award in Poetry and the Paterson Award for Sustained Literary Excellence.\nHis nonfiction collection of essays, cultural criticism, and \u201clyrical chorus,\u201d The Grey Album: On the Blackness of Blackness (2012) won the Graywolf Press Nonfiction Prize and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. It was also shortlisted for the PEN Open Award and was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year. Young is also the editor of the anthologies Jazz Poems (2006), John Berryman: Selected Poems (2004), Blues Poems (2003), and Giant Steps: The New Generation of African American Writers (2000).\n\u201cI feel like a poem is made up of poetic and unpoetic language, or unexpected language,\u201d Young said in a 2006 interview with Ploughshares. \u201cI think there are many other vernaculars, whether it\u2019s the vernacular of the blues, or the vernacular of visual art, the sort of living language of the everyday.\u201d For roughly a decade, Young was the Atticus Haygood Professor of Creative Writing and English and curator of Literary Collections and the Raymond Danowski Poetry Library at Emory University, and then the director of New York Public Library\u2019s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. He is the poetry editor of the New Yorker and the director of the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"]}}
