Though they could not afford the cost of formal education, Adonis\u2019s father taught his son to read and helped him memorize poems while he worked on the family farm. At fourteen, Adonis recited a poem to the president of Syria during his visit a neighboring town, after which the president offered to grant the boy\u2019s request to attend school. With the president\u2019s support, Adonis enrolled in a French high school and then Damascus University, where he earned a BA in philosophy. \u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn his late teens, he began writing under the name Adonis, after the Greek god of fertility. After a year in prison as a result of his political activity, Adonis moved to Beirut, where he found a rich community of expatriate writers and artists. There he cofounded and edited two progressive literary journals, Sh\u2019ir and Mawaqif, and earned a PhD at St. Joseph University.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBreaking with the tradition of formal structure in Arabic poetry, Adonis experiments with free verse, variable meters, and prose poetry as he engages themes of exile and transformation, in a voice at once playful and prophetic. In a 2010 interview with Charles McGrath for the New York Times, Adonis stated, \u201cI wanted to draw on Arab tradition and mythology without being tied to it,\u201d adding, \u201cI wanted to break the linearity of poetic text \u2014 to mess with it, if you will. The poem is meant to be a network rather than a single rope of thought.\u201d Publishers Weekly described Adonis\u2019 collection Mihyar of Damascus: His Songs as a \u201cseminal, startling, volatile, founding work of Arabic-language modernism.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAdonis is the author of numerous collections of poetry, including Adonis: Selected Poems (2010, translated by Khaled Mattawa), Mihyar of Damascus: His Songs (2008), If Only the Sea Could Sleep (2002), and The Blood of Adonis (1971), which won the International Poetry Forum\u2019s Syria-Lebanon Award. Adonis is also the author of the seminal work An Introduction to Arab Poetics (2003).\r\n\u00a0\r\nAdonis has won the first ever International N\u00e2zim Hikmet Poetry Award, the Norwegian Academy for Literature and Freedom of Expression\u2019s Bj\u00f8rnson Prize, the Highest Award of the International Poem Biennial in Brussels, and the Syria-Lebanon Best Poet Award. In 1983 he was elected into the St\u00e9phan\u00e9 Mallarm\u00e9 Academy.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAdonis has taught at the Sorbonne, Damascus University, and the Lebanese University. He lives in Paris.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Middle East"]}}
