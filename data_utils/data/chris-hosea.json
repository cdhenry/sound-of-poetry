In a 2011 interview with Rob Crawford for the Best American Poetry blog, Hosea states, \u201cIn general the work that I\u2019ve been doing, recently at least, is drawing more from a tradition of collage and the visual arts and poets who work using collage so that there are unexpected breaks between pieces of the poem, a lot of leaps that the reader needs to make, and hopefully that\u2019s enjoyable. I think the aim of it is to be pleasure, of some kind.\u201d On awarding the 2013 Walt Whitman Prize from the Academy of American Poets to Hosea\u2019s Put Your Hands In, poet John Ashbery describes Hosea\u2019s work as \u201ctransfixed in mid-paroxysm,\u201d observing, \u201cOne feels plunged in a wave of happening that is about to crest.\u201d\nWith poet Cecily Iddings, Hosea founded and edited The Blue Letter, a free, direct-mail poetry newsletter with original work by Lisa Robertson, Graham Foust, Rusty Morrison, and other poets. Hosea\u2019s work as an art curator includes Ode to Street Hassle (2012, BronxArtSpace), an exhibition of contemporary paintings and photography featuring Zoe Leonard, Kim Bennett, Kimi Hodges, and other artists.\nHosea lives in Brooklyn and works as an advertising copywriter.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
