He attended Yale University and the University of Chicago on a Fulbright grant and studied at the London School of Economics. His first collection of poetry, Old Savage / Young City, was published in 1964, and he went on to publish poetry in both the United States and Great Britain. Tarn\u2019s subsequent collections include Gondwana (2017), Ins and Outs of the Forest Rivers (2008), Avia: A Poem of International Air Combat, 1939\u20131945 (2008), Palenque: Selected Poems 1972\u20131984 (1986), At the Western Gates (1985), Landsongs (1982), Selected Poems: 1950\u20132000 (2002), The House of Leaves (1976), Lyrics for the Bride of God (1975), and The Beautiful Contradictions (1969).\nReviewing Selected Poems: 1950\u20132000 for Jacket, poet Brenda Hillman noted that Tarn\u2019s poetry \u201credefines nature and art for human culture, bringing a genuine psychological and linguistic curiosity about the human mind.\u201d Of his style, she observed, \u201cTarn manages an unusually flexible tone; he seems to be a man bargaining with reality. \u2026 He effects his tone through the use of fragments, uneasy segue ways, hesitations, alternating at times with long unpunctuated passages; he mixes prose and verse, brings in aphorism, remarks, songlike passages, technical language to allow the greatest emotional range.\u201d\nA respected translator and critic, Tarn translated Victor Segalen\u2019s Stelae (1969) as well as Pablo Neruda\u2019s Selected Poems: A Bilingual Edition (1970) and The Heights of Macchu Picchu (1966). Tarn\u2019s critical writing has been collected in The Embattled Lyric: Essays and Conversations on Poetics and Anthropology (2007) and Views from the Weaving Mountain: Selected Essays in Poetics and Anthropology (1991).\nTarn lives near Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n", "attrs": {}}
