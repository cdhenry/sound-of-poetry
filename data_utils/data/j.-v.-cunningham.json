Cunningham was highly regarded for his concise, witty, epigrammatic poetry. He was born to Irish parents in Cumberland, Maryland, and he grew up in Montana. Cunningham studied at Stanford University, where he earned an BA in 1934 and a PhD in 1945. He taught at the University of Chicago, the University of Hawaii, Harvard University, the University of Virginia, Washington University, and, starting in 1953, at Brandeis University, where he worked until his retirement in 1980. Cunningham is the author of the poetry collections The Poems of J.V. Cunningham (1997), Let Thy Words Be Few (1986), Some Salt: Poems and Epigrams (1967), The Exclusions of a Rhyme (1960), Trivial, Vulgar, and Exalted: Epigrams (1957) and The Helmsman (1942). He also published the essay collections The Collected Essays of J.V. Cunningham (1976) and Tradition and Poetic Structure (1960). Cunningham received fellowships from the Academy of American Poets and the Guggenheim Foundation, in addition to grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Institute of Arts and Letters.\nIn a 1961 study, The Poetry of J.V. Cunningham, Cunningham\u2019s mentor Yvor Winters called him \u201cthe most consistently distinguished poet writing in English today, and one of the finest in the language.\u201d About the same time, Thom Gunn wrote in a Yale Review article on The Exclusions of a Rhyme that Cunningham \u201cmust be one of the most accomplished poets alive, and one of the few of whom it can be said that he will still be worth reading in fifty years\u2019 time.\u201d In 1998, 13 years after Cunningham\u2019s death, Weekly Standard contributor J. Bottum, reviewing the comprehensive collection The Poems of J.V. Cunningham (1997), opined that Cunningham \u201cmay have been the most talented poet of his generation, one of only three or four masters of a particular poetic form in the history of English poetry, and a genuine American original.\u201d That form is the epigram, a term generally reserved for short, pithy poems (or sometimes, bits of prose). According to Bottum, many of Cunningham\u2019s poems are true epigrams, but even \u201chis longer poems tended toward the epigrammatic\u2014little quotable bits that express a thought with exceptional neatness.\u201d Cunningham\u2019s epigrammatic lines range from the solemn (\u201cLife flows to death as rivers to the sea / And life is fresh and death is salt to me\u201d) to the humorous, noting that a reader \u201cDislikes my book; calls it, to my discredit / A book you can\u2019t put down before you\u2019ve read it.\u201d\nEarly in his career, Cunningham tried some modernist techniques, but most of his poetry was in a formal, classic style, with emphasis on meter, rhyme, and precise use of language. This may have led some readers to consider his poems old-fashioned, and Cunningham was certainly never trendy. \u201cAlthough he lived through a number of poetic fads, he managed to remain unfashionable during them all,\u201d Bottum observed. Also, Cunningham\u2019s output of poetry was not large. He produced, Bottum noted, \u201cfewer than two hundred poems\u2014several only two lines long.\u201d While these factors kept Cunningham from reaching a large reading public, his admirers have contended that readers will find it worthwhile to seek out Cunningham\u2019s work.\n\r\nIn a review of Cunningham\u2019s first poetry collection, The Helmsman (1942), for Poetry magazine, Edward Weismiller wrote that the poems, \u201cdifficult as they are to place in the stream of American and English poetry, are of unusual interest. They are the products of a talent which is emphatically and avowedly not modern, but which, though it operates within quite narrow bounds, and intentionally so, is none the less expert and sensitive.\u201d Gunn commented that the poems in The Exclusions of a Rhyme (1960) use none of the forms popular in the mid-20th century; the verses \u201care stylistically as much of the seventeenth century as of the twentieth.\u201d This could prove off-putting to some readers, Gunn allowed, but added that no one should assume that a writer, such as Cunningham, \u201cwho scans, rhymes, and writes syntactically is less passionate than one who uses sentence fragments and free verse.\u201d Indeed, Cunningham shows great passion about a variety of topics in his poetry, Gunn asserted. In an essay for the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Steven Helmling remarked that Cunningham was suspicious of much of modern poetry\u2019s reliance on imagery. \u201cFor him, poetry must engage some outer reality not simply by pointing at it with an image or expressing a mood in relation to it; the poem must treat experience, make something of it,\u201d Helmling observed. Experiences treated in Cunningham\u2019s poetry include love, sex, his boyhood home of Montana, and the quest to understand the universe. Helmling pointed out that Cunningham\u2019s title for one of his collections, Trivial, Vulgar and Exalted: Epigrams (1957), \u201csuggests the extraordinary range\u201d of the poet\u2019s subject matter.\nAlongside the acclaim for Cunningham\u2019s verse stood some reservations about it. Weismiller, while finding much to praise, also found signs of emotional detachment in the poet\u2019s work. He opined that \u201cthere is something cold about Cunningham\u2019s poetry which seldom permits the reader to do more than admire; he regards the poet\u2019s experience, but does not enter in. ... [Cunningham] remains, of course, an admirable poet, whose technique is superb, but whose chosen austerity often puts a wall of clear ice between him and the reader.\u201d Louis Simpson, discussing The Exclusions of a Rhyme (1960) in the Hudson Review, saw Cunningham\u2019s work as excessively constrained. \u201cI admire Mr. Cunningham ... and I am glad that there is one of him in America,\u201d Simpson wrote. \u201cBut there are other ways of poetry which, I am afraid, Mr. Cunningham would exclude, and this brings me to my main criticism of his verse. It is simply that you cannot show the triumph of discipline over disorder unless you also show the disorder.\u201d Bottum, while holding Cunningham in high esteem, argued that \u201cit is worth asking why Cunningham is not an even better poet\u2014why the reader feels at last a narrowness in his verse, a poetic gift greater than his poetic output.\u201d Bottum believed he knew the answer: \u201cCunningham had nowhere to go once he mastered the epigram and the epigrammatical turn. His poems contain everything the epigram can do, but the epigram does not contain everything his poems could have done\u2014and consequently, much of his best poetry was never written and much of his greatest poetic impulse fell away unused.\u201d Despite these criticisms, though, many reviewers have proclaimed Cunningham\u2019s poetry to be work of lasting importance. Winters, who had some differences with his friend Cunningham, nevertheless asserted that while the output of some popular 20th-century poets will not age well, \u201cthe style of Cunningham ... will not be dated.\u201d\nCunningham critiqued his poetry in an essay, \u201cThe Quest of the Opal: A Commentary on The Helmsman.\u201d Winters took issue with some of the ideas Cunningham expressed\u2014such as a disdain for the use of sensory perception in poetry\u2014and went so far as to wish Cunningham had never written the essay. Some other scholars, though, have found much of value in \u201cThe Quest of the Opal.\u201d \u201cAs an exposition of his beliefs about poetry and as a commentary on several of his greatest poems, [it] is unsurpassable, the single most important prose text a student of Cunningham can read,\u201d Helmling wrote. Because the work is \u201cso brilliant and so quotable,\u201d he added, \u201cit seems unlikely that any critic will ever discuss Cunningham\u2019s poetry in any terms except Cunningham\u2019s.\u201d\nCunningham\u2019s prose works also include Woe or Wonder (1951), which Spectator contributor Patrick Cosgrave described as \u201cone of the few great (I chose the word very carefully) volumes of Shakespearian criticism.\u201d Geoffrey H. Hartman, in a piece for Poetry magazine, praised Woe or Wonder for looking realistically at Shakespeare\u2019s plays rather than trying to find hidden meanings in them. \u201cTo keep the truly old from misuse is surely as important as to recognize the genuinely new,\u201d Hartman remarked. Denis Donoghue, writing in Sewanee Review, called Woe or Wonder \u201cthe best introduction to Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies which I have read.\u201d This and several of Cunningham\u2019s other essays, on subjects such as literary style, were reprinted in The Collected Essays of J.V. Cunningham (1976). This publication led Donoghue to observe in the New York Times Book Review that Cunningham had \u201climitations\u201d as a critic: \u201cCunningham\u2019s mind is remarkably powerful, but it is always already made up, and it only receives such new experience as will confirm its judgment.\u201d At the same time, Donoghue declared, \u201cThe merit of Cunningham\u2019s criticism is indisputable. He is in touch with crucial themes, perennial rather than novel. He is relentless in his search for lucidity. ... He speaks only when he has something to say and when he has taken pains to discover the facts of the case.\u201d\nCunningham died in Waltham, Massachusetts on March 30, 1985.\n", "attrs": {}}
