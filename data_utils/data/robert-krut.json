He earned a BA in English from James Madison University and an MFA from Arizona State University. He is the author of The Now Dark Sky, Setting Us All on Fire (SUNY Press, 2019), which won the Codhill Poetry Award.\u00a0 His second collection,\u00a0This is the Ocean\u00a0(Bona Fide Books, 2013), received the Melissa Lanitis Gregory Poetry Award. Describing that book, Oliver de la Paz wrote, \u201cthe speaker attempts to divine mysteries from circles coffee mugs have left behind as well as the code of the flickering gas station bathroom lights. The holy is seen in hundreds of bats taking flight as well as the trunk of a tree opening into the unknown. Where the speaker, in delicate promises, tells us that there are lies far too beautiful to be ignored. The wonder and the wisdom of these poems will burn in your memory like the bright neon of a pier\u2019s Ferris wheel.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\nKrut is also the author of the chapbook Theory of the Walking Big Bang and the full-length poetry collection The Spider Sermons\u00a0(BlazeVox, 2009), about which Norman Dubie commented, \u201cThere is a sense of what is being seen here as with after images in an electrical storm. This is a brilliant book.\u201d Krut lives in Los Angeles and teaches at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
