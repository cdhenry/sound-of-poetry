After earning a BA from Fordham University and an MA from the University of Chicago, he moved to London in 1985. In England he won an Arts Council Writers Award and was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature; his work was recognized with the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize and the Whitbread Prize. In addition to writing and teaching, he played the flute and the bodhr\u00e1n, specializing in traditional Irish music.\n\r\nDonaghy\u2019s collections of poems are Shibboleth (1988); Errata (1990); Dances Learned Last Night: Poems 1975\u20131995 (2000); Conjure (2000), a Poetry Book Society Choice and Forward Poetry Prize Winner; Safest\u00a0(2005);\u00a0and Collected Poems (2009). He is also author of The Shape of the Dance: Essays, Interviews and Digressions (2009) and editor of 101 Poems About Childhood (2005).\n\r\nAdept at using traditional forms, as well as what poet Joshua Mehigan called \u201cfree verse organized by some rhetorical or syntactical principle,\u201d Donaghy often employed conceits, extended metaphors, puns, paradoxes, and stories. Reviewers have called him a metaphysical poet, and Mehigan noted that \u201ca poem\u2019s conceit might be as much an organizing principle as its formal structure.\u201d Witty and erudite, the poems reference literature, science, and the oddities and losses of contemporary life.\n\r\nDonaghy taught at City University and Birkbeck College, London. \u00a0He was married to the musician Maddy Paxman. Donaghy died of a brain hemorrhage in 2004.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
