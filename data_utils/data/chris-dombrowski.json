His publications include the chapbooks, Fragments with Dusk in Them\u00a0(2008), September Miniatures with Blood and Mars (2012), and the collections\u00a0By Cold Water (2009) and Earth Again (2013). He is also the author of the nonfiction collection,\u00a0Body of Water\u00a0(Milkweed Editions, 2016).\n\r\nIn a 2007 interview Dombrowski said that \u201cfinding the right form for the poem, I think, is why we write poetry.\u201d Citing his early reading of Norman McLean\u2019s novella\u00a0A River Runs Through It\u00a0as a formative influence on his decision to pursue writing, Dombrowski, who also works as a river guide, crafts meditative, free-verse poems that are deeply engaged with the natural world.\n\r\nHis honors include the Associated Writing Programs Intro Award, Alligator Juniper\u2019s National Poetry Prize, and a runner-up (Earth Again) for Foreword Magazine\u2019s Poetry Book of the Year. His poems have appeared in many literary journals and have been anthologized in\u00a0Joyful Noise: An Anthology of American Spiritual Poetry\u00a0(2006), Making Poems (2012), and others. \u00a0Both of his full-length volumes have garnered praise from reviewers. Writing on By Cold Water for Neo, critic Richard Simpson noted that Dombrowski composes \u201cfrom a loose, ancient, explosive formula: poem = dream =\u00a0vision = prophecy = myth \u2026. (and) suggests that if anything can save a broken world it may be visionary song.\u201d In Orion, Joe Wilkins lauded the \u201crisky and courageous\u201d poems in Earth Again for their ability \u201cto wrestle with the most nonsensical, most horrifying \u2026 of events,\u201d calling the work \u201cbeautiful and harrowing \u2026 a holy book.\u201d\nDombrowski has taught at the University of Montana and the Interlochen Center for the Arts, where he was a writer-in-residence. He lives in Missoula, Montana.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
