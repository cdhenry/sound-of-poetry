She began to write poetry in her twenties after being hospitalized with tuberculosis.\nHiggins\u2019s frank, wry poems often look squarely at economic and gender-based inequalities. Calling hers a \u201csmart, sassy, unabashed, female working class voice in Irish writing\u201d in a 2011 Irish Times review of Ireland Is Changing Mother, Fintan O\u2019Toole observes that \u201cthe anger in her work is transmuted into invention and absurdity, and it rubs shoulders with other deliciously deadly sins, like lust and pride.\u201d Higgins is the author of numerous collections, including Tongulish (2016),\u00a0Ireland Is Changing Mother (2011), Sunny Side Plucked: New & Selected Poems (1996), Philomena\u2019s Revenge (1992), and Goddess on the Mervue Bus (1986). She has also written many plays, including The Colossal Longing of Julie Connors (2014),\u00a0The Empty Frame (2008),\u00a0Down all the Roundabouts or (no one is entitled to a view) (1999) and Face Licker Come Home (1991), which was staged by Punchbag. Higgins has edited the anthologies Word and Image: A Collection of Poems from Sunderland Women\u2019s Centre and Washington Bridge Centre (2000) and Out the Clara Road: The Offaly Anthology (1999).\nHer honors include the Peadar O\u2019Donnell Award, several arts council grants, and residencies granted by National University of Ireland-Galway, Offaly County Council and Galway City Library. A member of Aosd\u00e1na, Higgins has taught at Texas Christian University. She lives in Galway and Spiddal.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Ireland & Northern Ireland"]}}
