She earned a BA from Sarah Lawrence College. The author of numerous books, she \u201cis one of the country\u2019s best-selling writers of literary fiction,\u201d according to Renee Tawa in the\u00a0Los Angeles Times. Walker is a feminist and vocal advocate for human rights, and she has earned critical and popular acclaim as a major American novelist and intellectual. Her literary reputation was secured with her Pulitzer Prize-winning third novel,\u00a0The Color Purple (1982),\u00a0which Steven Spielberg adapted into a popular film. Walker\u2019s numerous poetry collections include Hard Times Require Furious Dancing: New Poems (2019), Taking the Arrow Out of the Heart (2018), Absolute Trust in the Goodness of the Earth (2003), Her Blue Body Everything We Know: Earthling Poems (1991), Horses Make a Landscape Look More Beautiful (1985), and Once (1968). Her many honors include the O. Henry Award, the National Book Award, and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the MacDowell Colony, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Radcliffe Institute.\nUpon the release of The Color Purple, critics sensed that Walker had created something special. \u201cThe Color Purple \u2026 could be the kind of popular and literary event that transforms an intense reputation into a national one,\u201d according to Gloria Steinem of\u00a0Ms. Walker \u201chas succeeded,\u201d as Andrea Ford noted in the\u00a0Detroit Free Press,\u00a0\u201cin creating a jewel of a novel.\u201d Peter S. Prescott presented a similar opinion in a\u00a0Newsweek\u00a0review: \u201cThe Color Purple\u00a0is an American novel of permanent importance, that rare sort of book which (in Norman Mailer\u2019s felicitous phrase) amounts to \u2018a diversion in the fields of dread.\u2019\u201d\n\r\nJeanne Fox-Alston and Mel Watkins both found the appeal of\u00a0The Color Purple\u00a0in the synthesis of characters and themes found in Walker\u2019s earlier works, that it brings together the best of the author\u2019s literary production in one volume. Fox-Alston, in Chicago\u2019s\u00a0Tribune Books,\u00a0remarked, \u201cCelie, the main character in Walker\u2019s third \u2026 novel,\u00a0The Color Purple,\u00a0is an amalgam of all those women [characters in Walker\u2019s previous books]; she embodies both their desperation and, later, their faith.\u201d Watkins stated in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review,\u00a0\u201cHer previous books \u2026 have elicited praise for Miss Walker as a lavishly gifted writer.\u00a0The Color Purple,\u00a0while easily satisfying that claim, brings into sharper focus many of the diverse themes that threaded their way through her past work.\u201d\n\r\nWalker\u2019s\u00a0writing reflects her roots in Georgia, where Black vernacular was prominent and the stamp of slavery and oppression were still present. When she was eight, Walker was accidentally shot in the eye by a brother playing with his BB gun. Her parents, who were too poor to afford a car, could not take her to a doctor for several days. By that time, her wound was so bad that she had lost the use of her right eye. This handicap influenced her writer\u2019s voice;\u00a0she withdrew from others and became a meticulous observer of human relationships and interaction.\n\r\nAn excellent student, Walker was awarded a scholarship to Spelman College in 1961. The civil rights movement attracted her, and she became an activist. In 1963, she decided to continue her education at Sarah Lawrence College in New York, where she began to work seriously on writing poems, publishing several in a college journal. After graduation, she moved to Mississippi to teach and continue to engage in social activism, and she met and married Melvyn Leventhal, a Jewish civil rights lawyer. The two became the only legally married interracial couple living in Jackson, Mississippi. After their divorce in 1976, Walker\u2019s literary output increased.\n\r\nWalker coined the term \u201cWomanist\u201d to describe her philosophical stance on the issue of gender. As a Womanist, she sees herself as someone who appreciates women\u2019s culture and femininity. Her work often reflects this stance, as well as the universality of human experience. Walker\u2019s central characters are almost always Black women; Walker, according to Steinem, \u201ccomes at universality through the path of an American black woman\u2019s experience. \u2026 She speaks the female experience more powerfully for being able to pursue it across boundaries of race and class.\u201d This universality is also noted by Fox-Alston, who remarked that Walker has a \u201creputation as a provocative writer who writes about blacks in particular, but all humanity in general.\u201d\n\r\nWalker is deeply invested in revealing the experiences of Black women. Thadious M. Davis, in his\u00a0Dictionary of Literary Biography\u00a0essay, commented: \u201cWalker writes best of the social and personal drama in the lives of familiar people who struggle for survival of self in hostile environments. She has expressed a special concern with exploring the oppressions, the insanities, the loyalties and the triumph of black women.\u201d\nGloria Steinem pointed out that\u00a0Meridian\u00a0(1976), Walker\u2019s second novel, \u201cis often cited as the best novel of the civil rights movement, and is taught as part of some American history as well as literature courses.\u201d In\u00a0Everyday Use (1994),\u00a0Barbara Christian found the title story\u2014first published in Walker\u2019s collection\u00a0In Love and Trouble: Stories of Black Women (1973)\u2014to be \u201cpivotal\u201d to all of Walker\u2019s work in its evocation of Black sisterhood and Black women\u2019s heritage of quilting. William Peden, writing in\u00a0The American Short Story: Continuity and Change, 1940-1975,\u00a0called this same collection \u201ca remarkable book.\u201d David Guy\u2019s commentary on\u00a0The Color Purple\u00a0in the\u00a0Washington Post Book World\u00a0included this evaluation: \u201cthe women [in the novel] are able to extricate themselves from oppression; they leave their men, find useful work to support themselves. ... In\u00a0The Color Purple\u00a0the role of male domination in the frustration of black women\u2019s struggle for independence is clearly the focus.\u201d\n\r\nSome reviewers criticize Walker\u2019s fiction for portraying an overly negative view of Black men.\u00a0Charles Larson, in his\u00a0Detroit News\u00a0review of\u00a0The Color Purple,\u00a0remarked, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say that all the male characters [in the novel] are villains, but the truth is fairly close to that.\u201d However, Larson did not feel that this\u00a0is a major fault in the novel, and he noted that by the end of the novel, \u201cseveral of [Walker\u2019s] masculine characters have reformed.\u201d\n\r\nThis idea of reformation, this sense of hope even in despair, is at the core of Walker\u2019s vision. In spite of the brutal effects of sexism and racism suffered by the characters of her short stories and novels, critics note what Art Seidenbaum of the\u00a0Los Angeles Times\u00a0called Walker\u2019s sense of \u201caffirmation \u2026 [that] overcomes her anger.\u201d This is particularly evident in\u00a0The Color Purple,\u00a0according to several reviewers. Ford, for example, asserted that the author\u2019s \u201cpolemics on \u2026 political and economic issues finally give way to what can only be described as a joyful celebration of human spirit\u2014exulting, uplifting and eminently universal.\u201d Prescott discovered a similar progression in the novel. He wrote, \u201c[Walker\u2019s] story begins at about the point that most Greek tragedies reserve for the climax, then \u2026 by immeasurable small steps \u2026 works its way toward acceptance, serenity and joy.\u201d\n\r\nDavis referred to this idea as Walker\u2019s \u201cvision of survival\u201d and offered a summary of its significance in Walker\u2019s work. \u201cAt whatever cost, human beings have the capacity to live in spiritual health and beauty; they may be poor, black, and uneducated, but their inner selves can blossom.\u201d This vision, extended to all humanity, is evident in Walker\u2019s collection\u00a0Living by the Word: Selected Writings, 1973-1987.\u00a0Although \u201cher original interests centered on black women, and especially on the ways they were abused or underrated,\u201d\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0contributor Noel Perrin believed that \u201cnow those interests encompass all creation.\u201d Judith Paterson similarly observed in\u00a0Tribune Books\u00a0that in\u00a0Living by the Word,\u00a0\u201cWalker casts her abiding obsession with the oneness of the universe in a question: Do creativity, love and spiritual wholeness still have a chance of winning the human heart amid political forces bent on destroying the universe with poisonous chemicals and nuclear weapons?\u201d Walker explores this question through journal entries and essays that engage with Native Americans, racism in China, a lonely horse, smoking, and response to the criticism leveled against both the novel and the film version of\u00a0The Color Purple.\u00a0Derrick Bell noted in his\u00a0Los Angeles Times Book Review\u00a0critique that Walker \u201cuses carefully crafted images that provide a universality to unique events.\u201d The critic further asserted that\u00a0Living by the Word\u00a0\u201cis not only vintage Alice Walker: passionate, political, personal, and poetic, it also provides a panoramic view of a fine human being saving her soul through good deeds and extraordinary writing.\u201d\nThough Walker\u2019s fourth novel,\u00a0The Temple of My Familiar (1989) received harsh reviews by critics, novelist J. M. Coetzee, writing in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review,\u00a0implored the reader to look upon the novel as a \u201cfable of recovered origins, as an exploration of the inner lives of contemporary black Americans as these are penetrated by fabulous stories.\u201d Bernard W. Bell, writing in the\u00a0Chicago Tribune,\u00a0felt that the novel is a \u201ccolorful quilt of many patches,\u201d and that its \u201cstylized lovers, remembrances of things past, bold flights of fantasy and vision of a brave new world of cultural diversity and cosmic harmony challenge the reader\u2019s willingness to suspend disbelief.\u201d\nFor Walker\u2019s Her Blue Body Everything We Know: Earthling Poems, 1965-1990 Complete (2003),\u00a0a\u00a0Publishers Weekly\u00a0reviewer offered high praise, characterizing Walker as \u201ccomposed, wry, unshaken by adversity,\u201d and suggesting that her \u201cstrong, beautiful voice\u201d beckons us \u201cto heal ourselves and the planet.\u201d\n\r\nCritics celebrated Walker\u2019s controversial fifth novel,\u00a0Possessing the Secret of Joy (1992),\u00a0about the practice of female genital mutilation in certain African, Asian, and Middle Eastern cultures. Writing in the\u00a0Los Angeles Times Book Review,\u00a0Tina McElroy Ansa said that taking on such a taboo subject showed Walker\u2019s depth and range. The critic also felt that her portrait of the suffering of Tashi\u2014a character from The Color Purple\u2014is \u201cstunning.\u201d And Donna Haisty Winchell wrote in her\u00a0Dictionary of Literary Biography\u00a0essay that\u00a0this novel is \u201cmuch more concise, more controlled, and more successful as art\u201d than\u00a0The Temple of My Familiar, and demonstrates an effective blend of \u201cart and activism.\u201d\n\r\nWalker\u2019s concerns about the international issue of female genital mutilation prompted her to further explore the issue, both on film and in the book\u00a0Warrior Marks: Female Genital Mutilation and the Sexual Blinding of Women (1993), written with documentary film director Pratibha Parmar. According to a\u00a0Publishers Weekly\u00a0contributor,\u00a0Warrior Marks\u00a0is a \u201cforceful account\u201d of how the two filmed a documentary on the ritual circumcision of African women.\n\r\nIn 1996, Walker published\u00a0The Same River Twice: Honoring the Difficult; A Meditation of Life, Spirit, Art, and the Making of the film \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d Ten Years Later.\u00a0The book focuses mainly on Walker\u2019s feelings about, and struggles with, the filming of\u00a0The Color Purple.\u00a0While having the book transformed into a film by Steven Spielberg was a high point in her life, it was also riddled with difficulties. First, Spielberg rejected Walker\u2019s screenplay of the book and implemented one with which Walker was not happy. In addition, the film itself was met with controversy and attacks on Walker\u2019s ideas\u2014some people thought she had attacked the character of Black people in general and Black men specifically. Also at the time, Walker\u2019s mother was critically ill, while Walker herself was suffering from Lyme disease. Included in the book are fan letters, reviews, and Walker\u2019s original version of the script.\nWalker\u2019s sixth novel,\u00a0By the Light of My Father\u2019s Smile (1998), focuses on female sexuality. The main characters are the Robinsons, a husband-and-wife team of anthropologists, and the story is told in flashback. Unable to secure funding for research in Mexico in the 1950s, the husband poses as a minister to study the Mundo, a mixed Black and Native American tribe. The couple brings along their young daughter to this new life in the Sierra Madre. Sexuality is at the heart of the story, though the father reacts violently upon discovering that his daughter has become involved with a Mundo boy. This reaction has repercussions throughout the novel. Again, Walker experiments with points of view, even recounting the action through the eyes of the recently deceased patriarch of the Robinson clan. According to Francine Prose, who reviewed the novel in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review,\u00a0this novel deals with the \u201cdamaging ways in which our puritanical culture suppresses women\u2019s sexuality.\u201d\nIn her book Anything We Love Can Be Saved: A Writer\u2019s Activism (1997),\u00a0Walker details her own political and social struggle, while in the critically acclaimed short-story collection\u00a0The Way Forward Is with a Broken Heart (2000),\u00a0she employs fiction in a \u201cquasi-autobiographical reflection\u201d on her own past, including her marriage to a Jewish civil rights lawyer, the birth of her daughter, and the creative life she built after her divorce. For Jeff Guinn, writing for the\u00a0Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service,\u00a0the 13 stories plus epilogue of this collection \u201cbeautifully leavened the universal regrets of middle age with dollops of uplifting philosophy.\u201d A contributor for\u00a0Publishers Weekly\u00a0described the collection as a reflection on the \u201cnature of passion and friendship, pondering the emotional trajectories of lives and loves.\u201d This same reviewer found the collection to be \u201cstrong \u2026 [and] moving.\u201d Adele S. News-Horst, reviewing the book in\u00a0World Literature Today,\u00a0found that it is \u201cpeopled by characters who are refugees, refugees from the war over civil rights, from the \u2018criminal\u2019 Vietnam-American War, and from sexual oppression.\u201d News-Horst further commented that the \u201cstories are neither forced nor unnatural, and there is a sense of truth in all of them.\u201d And Linda Barrett Osborne, writing in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review,\u00a0called\u00a0The Way Forward\u00a0a \u201ctouching and provocative collection.\u201d\nAfter publishing The Way Forward, Walker had, she thought, given up writing, taking time off to study Tibetan Buddhism and explore the Amazon. Fueled by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, however, she began writing poems. In 2003, she published Absolute Trust in the Goodness of the Earth, which includes poems that engage with the attacks on New York and Washington, DC. Guinn described the verse in the new collection as \u201cchoppy, with sparse clumps of words presented in odd, brisk rhythms.\u201d Such devices resulted, Guinn thought, in occasional \u201csophisticated thought in simple, accessible form.\u201d Short lines in free verse are the skeletons of most of the poems in the collection, many of them dealing with \u201csocial and environmental justice, and America\u2019s blinding ethnocentrism,\u201d as Kelly Norman Ellis remarked in\u00a0Black Issues Book Review.\u00a0Ellis further praised the poems in the collection as \u201cpsalms about the human capacity for great good and \u2026 for unimagined brutality.\u201d\nWalker\u2019s\u00a0seventh novel,\u00a0Now Is the Time to Open Your Heart (2004), is a tale of a successful Black female novelist, Kate, and her search for new meaning as she approaches 60. In a long-time relationship with the artist Yolo, Kate decides to voyage down the Colorado River and then down the Amazon, on trips of self-discovery. Yolo meanwhile goes on his own quest, to Hawaii, and to the woman he once loved. Both Kate and Yolo are changed by their experiences. In Black Issues Book Review, Susan McHenry noted that she \u201cstarted this novel skeptically, fearing a New Age ramble,\u201d but found \u201creading this book a richly rewarding journey.\u201d And\u00a0Booklist\u2019s Vanessa Bush praised this \u201cdreamlike novel [that] incorporates the political and spiritual consciousness and emotional style for which [Walker] is known and appreciated.\u201d\nWalker lives in Mendocino, California.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"], "School/Period:": ["Black Arts Movement"]}}
