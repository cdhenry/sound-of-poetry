His mother was a schoolteacher and his father a farm laborer and market gardener. He is the author of a number of poetry collections, including New Weather (1973), Why Brownlee Left (1980), Quoof (1983), Meeting the British (1987), New Selected Poems: 1968-1994 (1996), Hay (1998), Moy Sand and Gravel (2002), which won the Pulitzer Prize and the Griffin Poetry Prize, Horse Latitudes (2006), and most recently One Thousand Things Worth Knowing (2015), Selected Poems 1968-2104 (2016), and Frolic and Detour (2019). He has also published collections of criticism, children\u2019s books, opera libretti, song lyrics, and works for radio and television.\nMuldoon\u2019s poetry is known for its use of paradox: his poems are playful but serious, elusive but direct, innovative but traditional. He uses traditional verse forms such as the sonnet, ballad, and dramatic monologue, but alters their length and basic structure, and uses rhyme and meter in innovative ways. His work is also notable for its layered use of conceit, allusion, and wit. The cryptic wordplay present in many poems has often been called Joycean, but Muldoon himself has cited lyric poets such as Robert Frost, Dylan Thomas, and Louis MacNeice as his major influences.\nOne of the youngest member of a group of Northern Irish poets\u2014including Seamus Heaney, Michael Longley, and Derek Mahon\u2014who gained prominence in the 1960s and 1970s, Muldoon studied with Heaney as a student at Queen\u2019s University in Belfast. In 1971, at the age of 19, Muldoon completed his first short collection, Knowing My Place. Two years later, he published New Weather, his first widely reviewed volume of poetry. The book secured Muldoon\u2019s place among Ireland\u2019s finest writers and helped establish his reputation as an innovative new voice in English-language poetry. The poems in New Weather generally illuminate the complexities of seemingly ordinary things or events. Calling the collection \u201cthe result of continuous age and aging,\u201d Roger Conover suggested in a review for Eire-Ireland, \u201cMuldoon\u2019s is a poetry which sees into things, and speaks of the world in terms of its own internal designs and patterns.\u201d Muldoon followed New Weather with the 1977 collection Mules. Recurring themes of political and social tensions inform the pastorals and ballads in Mules, as do family anecdotes, Muldoon\u2019s rural upbringing, and a wide range of literary and cultural allusion.\u00a0 In Preoccupations: Selected Prose, Heaney deemed Mules \u201ca strange, rich second collection\u201d and judged the poet \u201cone of the very best.\u201d\nMuldoon\u2019s work in the 1980s and 1990s attracted considerable attention for its technical acumen, dry verbal wit, and provocative use of language. Why Brownlee Left included an influential final poem, the long \u201cImmram,\u201d that brought together two impulses that inform Muldoon\u2019s work, argued Ian Hamilton in The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry in English, \u201ca Northern Irish Catholic sensibility and the English poetic tradition.\u201d In collections such as Quoof, Meeting the British, Madoc: A Mystery (1990), The Annals of Chile (1994), and Hay (1998) continued to experiment with narrative, lyric, and traditional forms in dazzling and erudite hybrid modes. The long poem, \u201c7 Middagh Street,\u201d from Meeting the British blended fantasy and history. A series of imaginary monologues by such prominent artistic and literary figures as W.H. Auden, Salvador Dali, Gypsy Rose Lee, Carson McCullers, and Louis MacNeice, \u201c7, Middagh Street\u201d contained provocative commentary on the importance of politics in Irish art. The blend of history and politics, formal experimentation and stylistic play, personal utterance and rhetorical bravura marks all of Muldoon\u2019s work. Some critics have voiced occasional skepticism about Muldoon\u2019s facility. Reviewing Hay in the New Republic, Adam Kirsch noted: \u201cif virtuosity is all that a poet can display, if his poems demand attention simply because of their elaborateness and difficulty, then he has in some sense failed.\u201d And William Logan remarked that \u201cMuldoon is \u2026 in love (not wisely but too well) with language itself. \u2026 Too often the result is tedious foolery, the language run amok with Jabberwocky possibility (words, words, monotonously inbreeding), as if possibility were reason enough for the doing.\u201d Yet, both Logan and Kirsch also praised Muldoon. Logan concluded: \u201cEveryone interested in contemporary poetry should read this book \u2026 In our time of tired mirrors and more-than-tiresome confession, Muldoon is the rare poet who writes through the looking glass.\u201d\nMuldoon\u2019s poems have been collected into four books, Selected Poems 1968-1986 (1986), New Selected Poems: 1968-1994 (1996), Poems 1968-1998 (2001), and Selected Poems 1968-2014 (2016). His book Moy Sand and Gravel won both the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry and the International Griffin Poetry Prize, and his collection Horse Latitudes was shortlisted for the TS Eliot Prize. His recent collections of poetry include Maggot (2010), One Thousand Things Worth Knowing (2015), and Frolic and Detour (2019).\nMuldoon has also published critical works, including The End of the Poem: Oxford Lectures in Poetry (2006). Bringing together the fifteen lectures Muldoon delivered as Oxford Professor of Poetry\u2014a post he held from 1999 to 2004\u2014the lectures, argued Adam Phillips in the London Review of Books, \u201care about poetic influence more than anything else \u2026 Muldoon is generous and expansive in his naming of names; he is the exemplary poet as fan.\u201d Muldoon\u2019s Clarendon lectures in English were collected in the alphabetic survey of Irish literature, To Ireland, I (2000). Reviewing the book for the Times Literary Supplement, Clair Wills found \u201csomething irreducibly esoteric about this trip through the weird and wonderful land of Irish letters, and the quirkiness, bordering on whimsy, will no doubt alienate many readers. This is unfortunate, because the book also contains some of Muldoon\u2019s most forthright reflections to date on the relations of history, literature and politics.\u201d\nIn addition to poetry, Muldoon has written libretti, rock lyrics\u2014for Warren Zevon, The Handsome Family, and his own band, Rackett\u2014and many books for children. He edited both the Faber Anthology of Contemporary Irish Poetry (1986) and the Faber Book of Beasts (1997). He has also translated the work of Irish poets, including Nuala N\u00ed Dhomhnaill, into English. He adapted James Joyce\u2019s short story \u201cThe Dead\u201d with his wife, novelist Jean Hanff Korelitz into \u201cThe Dead, 1904,\u201d a site-specific play produced by the Irish Repertory Theatre and Dot Dot Productions LLC. The show had runs in 2016 and 2017.\nMuldoon has won many major poetry awards, including the John William Corrington Award for Literary Excellence, the Queen\u2019s Gold Medal for Poetry, and the Seamus Heaney Award for Arts and Letters. He served as poetry editor of the New Yorker from 2007 to 2017. Since 1987 Muldoon has lived in the United States, where he is Howard G.B. Clark Professor of the Humanities and Founding Chair of the Peter B. Lewis Center for the Arts at Princeton University. Paul Muldoon lives with his wife and their two children near Princeton, New Jersey.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Ireland & Northern Ireland"]}}
