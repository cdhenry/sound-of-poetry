He settled in London in the early 1820s. Though he did not receive significant critical acclaim during his lifetime, he gained recognition in the 20th century for his linguistic and metrical inventiveness. \u00a0 His poetry includes The Errors of Ecstacie (1822), The Labours of Idleness; Or, Seven Nights\u2019 Entertainments (1826), and the epic Nepenthe (1835). An introduction to his work can be found in Selections from the Poems of George Darley (1904), edited by R.A. Streatfeild. His poem \u201cIt is not beauty I demand\u201d so resembled the poetry of the 17th-century Caroline period that it was mistakenly anthologized in Palgrave\u2019s Golden Treasury.  \u00a0 Darley also published several plays, including Sylvia (1827), Thomas \u00c0 Becket (1840), and Ethelstan (1841). He worked as a writer of mathematical textbooks and as a drama critic for the London Magazine and as an art critic for the Athenaeum, often publishing under the pen name John Lacy.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Ireland & Northern Ireland"]}}
