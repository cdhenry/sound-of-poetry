She earned a BA at the University of Virginia, an MFA in poetry from the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, and an MA in piano performance from the New England Conservatory of Music.\nHer poetry collections include Must A Violence (2012), Spring (2008), which was chosen for the National Poetry Series, and What Animal (2003). Spring includes a version of her layered, kinetic poem \u201cThe Mandrake Vehicles\u201d as a flash-animation CD. Presenting Spring with the 2009 Poetry Honors award, the Massachusetts Book Awards judges stated, \u201cThis is a work that grips down and awakens the very roots of a poetic process that is still and still moving, a \u2018journeywork\u2019 as Whitman might have called it, a multidimensional text that will transform the way Buchanan\u2019s generation and future generations of poets approach poem-making.\u201d\nBuchanan\u2019s formally inventive poetry incorporates polyphonic, mathematical, and typographic elements into mosaics of ecstatic, searching beauty. In a statement for the Poetry Society of America, Buchanan traced the arc of the first poem she loved, Edward Gorey\u2019s \u201cThe Object-Lesson,\u201d whose tunneling and blossoming influenced the inventive unfolding that is a signature of Buchanan\u2019s work. Buchanan praised Gorey\u2019s piece for \u201chow selectively withheld information combined with selectively presented details (and the placement of those details in the poem, the manner in which they surface, the timing of their appearance, their endurance, their disappearance) endowed objects, people, landscapes with a kind of radiant shifting, mutability, and depth which made them real and unknown in the way that real things are unknown and able to be tapped for the most alien of revelations.\u201d\nBuchanan\u2019s poems have been included in the anthologies Legitimate Dangers: American Poets of the New Century (2006), Best American Poetry (2004), and Isn\u2019t It Romantic: 100 Love Poems by Younger American Poets (2004).\nAs a concert pianist, she has released several solo piano albums. She lives in Boston, Massachusetts with her husband, poet Jon Woodward, and maintains a private teaching studio for piano.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
