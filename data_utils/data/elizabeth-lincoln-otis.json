Her poem \u201cAn \u2018If\u2019 for Girls\u201d refers to Rudyard Kipling\u2019s poem \u201cIf,\u201d written in 1895, which addresses the path toward ideal manhood. Kipling\u2019s poem inspired several poetic responses on the theme of ideal womanhood, including poems by J.P. McEvoy and Gale Baker Stanton. Otis\u2019s poem on that topic, written in a clear, direct style, was published in the anthology Father: An Anthology of Verse (1931).\n                                                            ", "attrs": {}}
