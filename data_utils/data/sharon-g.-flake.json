She earned a BA in English from the University of Pittsburgh and worked in foster care and family and community services before joining the public relations staff at the University of Pittsburgh Press. While working for the press, Flake wrote her bestselling debut young adult novel, The Skin I\u2019m In (1998). The novel received the Coretta Scott King/John Steptoe Award for New Talent and the YWCA Racial Justice Award and was named a New York Public Library Top Ten Book for the Teen Age, a YALSA Best Book for Young Adults, and one of the Bank Street College of Education Best Children\u2019s Books of the Year. The novel also earned Flake a Detroit Free Library Author of the Year Award. Flake\u2019s novels and short stories deal with the struggles of teenagers and young people of color and have received praise for their honest and urgent portrayals of complex issues and themes. Her second novel, Money Hungry (2001), dealt with a family facing homelessness and received the Coretta Scott King Award and was a Carolyn Field Honor Book, among other awards. Flake\u2019s other works for teenagers and young adults include\u00a0Unstoppable Octobia May (2014);\u00a0Pinned (2012);\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bYou Don\u2019t Even Know Me: Stories and Poems About Boys (2010);\u00a0The Broken Bike Boy and the Queen of 33rd Street (2007), illustrated by Colin Bootman;\u00a0Bang! (2005);\u00a0the short story collection Who Am I Without Him? (2004); and\u00a0Begging for Change (2003).\nIn 2002, Flake answered questions from fans for the New York Public Library. She described what she thinks about feedback from adults and young people: \u201cGrown-ups try to tell me more than kids what I should do, and I ignore them. I just think that everybody should know their own stories. What inspired me in terms of young people are young people who tell me that they hated to read or were bad readers, and they liked my work and it made them want to read more, or read somebody else\u2019s work. That motivates me to keep writing. \u2026 Young people (including my daughter) bring me the most joy, and make me really happy to be a writer.\u201d Flake lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
