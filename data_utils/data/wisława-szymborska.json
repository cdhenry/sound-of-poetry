In awarding the prize, the Academy praised her \u201cpoetry that with ironic precision allows the historical and biological context to come to light in fragments of human reality.\u201d Collections of her poems that have been translated into English include People on a Bridge (1990), View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems (1995), Miracle Fair (2001), and Monologue of a Dog (2005).\n\r\nReaders of Szymborska\u2019s poetry have often noted its wit, irony, and deceptive simplicity. Her poetry examines domestic details and occasions, playing these against the backdrop of history. In the poem \u201cThe End and the Beginning,\u201d Szymborska writes, \u201cAfter every war / someone\u2019s got to tidy up.\u201d\n\r\nIn the New York Times Book Review, Stanislaw Baranczak wrote, \u201cThe typical lyrical situation on which a Szymborska poem is founded is the confrontation between the directly stated or implied opinion on an issue and the question that raises doubt about its validity. The opinion not only reflects some widely shared belief or is representative of some widespread mind-set, but also, as a rule, has a certain doctrinaire ring to it: the philosophy behind it is usually speculative, anti-empirical, prone to hasty generalizations, collectivist, dogmatic and intolerant.\u201d\n\r\nSzymborska lived most of her life in Krakow; she studied Polish literature and society at Jagiellonian University and worked as an editor and columnist. A selection of her reviews was published in English under the title Nonrequired Reading: Prose Pieces (2002). She received the Polish PEN Club prize, the Goethe Prize, and the Herder Prize.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Poland"]}}
