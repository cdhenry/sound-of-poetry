He earned his undergraduate degree at Cambridge University, where he studied with legendary critic F.R. Leavis. Many of Hobsbaum\u2019s attitudes and beliefs about the importance of rational discussion, close reading and elocution, and poetry\u2019s civic role spring from his time at Cambridge, where he met and read young poets such as Thom Gunn, Ted Hughes, and Peter Redgrove. Moving to London in 1955, Hobsbaum formed \u201cThe Group,\u201d a series of poetry workshops that included British poets Martin Bell, George MacBeth, Peter Porter, and Edward Lucie-Smith. Hobsbaum completed his PhD at the University of Sheffield under William Empson and went on to teach at Queen\u2019s University and Glasgow University, where he continued to form Group-style workshops that included poets such as Derek Mahon, Seamus Heaney, Tom Leonard, and Anne Stevenson. Before the existence of official creative writing programs, Hobsbaum\u2019s \u201cGroups\u201d brought poets together to read, discuss, and workshop their work.\nHobsbaum wrote four books of poetry: The Place\u2019s Fault (1964), In Retreat and Other Poems (1966), Coming Out Fighting (1969), and Women and Animals (1972). His works of criticism include A Theory of Communication (1970), Tradition and Experiment in English Poetry (1979), Essentials of Literary Criticism (1983), and Metre, Rhythm and Verse Form (1996). He also wrote several reader\u2019s guides, including A Reader\u2019s Guide to Charles Dickens (1972), A Reader\u2019s Guide to D.H. Lawrence (1981), and A Reader\u2019s Guide to Robert Lowell (1988).\nSeamus Heaney wrote of his former teacher: \u201cHe emanated energy, generosity, belief in the community, trust in the parochial, the inept, the unprinted. He was impatient, dogmatic, relentlessly literary: yet he was patient with those he trusted, unpredictably susceptible to a wide variety of poems and personalities, and urgent that the social and political exacerbations of our place should disrupt the decorums of literature.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
