In addition to her many highly-regarded translations of classical writers such as Sappho and Euripides, and her triptych rendering of An Oresteia (2009), she\u00a0has published poems, essays, libretti, prose criticism, and verse novels that often cross genres. Known for her supreme erudition\u2014Merkin called her \u201cone of the great pasticheurs\u201d\u2014her poetry can also be heart-breaking and she regularly writes on love, desire, sexual longing and despair. Always an ambitious poet whatever her topic or genre, Merkin wrote of Carson\u2019s The Beauty of the Husband, \u201cI don\u2019t think there has been a book since Robert Lowell\u2019s Life Studies that has advanced the art of poetry quite as radically as Anne Carson is in the process of doing.\u201d Carson\u2019s recent collections include Nox (2010), Red Doc> (2013), and Float (2016). Her honors and awards are many, including fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, and the American Academy in Berlin. She has also received the Lannan Literary Award, the Pushcart Prize, and the Griffin Poetry Prize.\nCarson was born in Toronto, Ontario in 1950. A high-school encounter with a Latin instructor, who agreed to teach her ancient Greek over the lunch hour, led to her passionate embrace of classical and Hellenic literature, influences which mark her work still. Carson attended the University of Toronto, though she dropped out twice before earning her BA, MA and PhD in Classics. Carson has taught at many universities in both the US and Canada, including McGill and the University of Michigan. Her publishing career began with Eros the Bittersweet: An Essay (1986), which also established Carson\u2019s style of patterning her writings after classical Greek literature. Such works as Glass, Irony, and God (1992), Plainwater: Essays and Poetry (1995) and Men in the Off Hours (2001) have helped seal the author\u2019s reputation as unique among contemporary poets. But perhaps the most widely received examples of her particular specialty are Carson\u2019s verse novels, Autobiography of Red: A Novel in Verse (1998) and The Beauty of the Husband: A Fictional Essay in 29 Tangos (2001).\n\nAutobiography of Red\u00a0(1998) takes its cue from the legend of Hercules\u2014Herakles in the traditional spelling from the tale by Steischoros\u2014whose tenth labor was to slay the red-winged monster Geryon. Recasting the story in modern time, Carson makes some significant choices. \u201cIn Steischoros, Herakles kills Geryon and steals his red cattle,\u201d explained Adam Kirsch in New Republic. \u201cIn Carson, Herakles breaks Geryon\u2019s heart and steals his innocence.\u201d The two characters are introduced as teenagers, Geryon (still red and sporting wings) a sheltered, sensitive high-school boy and Herakles a sexy, rebellious roughneck. The two begin an affair that ends as \u201cHerakles cannot match the soul-tearing totality of Geryon\u2019s adoration,\u201d as Chicago Review contributor Mark Halliday described it. Years later the two characters meet in Buenos Aires where Geryon falls into a destructive m\u00e9nage a trois with Herakles and his new boyfriend, Ankash. The book drew strong reactions in several periodicals. Halliday felt that the book was \u201cwillfully whimsical and delightedly peculiar.\u201d The Nation critic Bruce Hainley pronounced Carson \u201ca philosopher of heartbreak\u201d and said her epic-length poem made for \u201ca brilliant book about desire, the ancient Greek poet Steischoros, volcanoes and the joyful brutalities of seeing and blindness\u201d Echoing debates that continue to swirl around the Carson\u2019s prose-like poetics, Kirsch wondered if Carson had indeed produced the verse promised in the book\u2019s subtitle. \u201cThe writing is clearly prose,\u201d he maintained, \u201claid out in alternating long and short lines, with no strictness of measure or rhythm; the division between a long line and a short one is typographical only, or at best syntactic.\u201d\n\r\nCarson\u2019s fable went on to earn nods from prize committees, though Autobiography of Red \u201cdid not start out a winner,\u201d according to Time International reporter Katherine Govier. \u201cPublished to scant notice . . . it was mainly talked about by writers here and there. Talk became buzz when the book won Quebec\u2019s QSPELL poetry award.\u201d From there the volume went on to earn a National Book Critics Circle nomination, making the Canadian-born Carson one of the first two non-Americans to appear on the Circle\u2019s short list. Such word-of-mouth echoes the reception of another Carson book, her early volume Eros the Bittersweet (1986). According to John D\u2019Agata in the Boston Review, the book \u201cfirst stunned the classics community as a work of Greek scholarship; then it stunned the nonfiction community as an inspired return to the lyrically based essays once produced by Seneca, Montaigne, and Emerson; and then, and only then, deep into the 1990s, reissued as \u201cliterature and redesigned for an entirely new audience, it finally stunned the poets.\u201d D\u2019Agata sees Carson\u2019s earlier work as an essayist everywhere in her poetry, along with her deep absorption in Classical languages. Carson\u2019s work, D\u2019Agata alleges, asks one to consider \u201chow prosaic, rhetorical, or argumentative can a poem be before it becomes something else altogether, before it reverts to prose, to essay?\u201d\n\nMen in the Off Hours, a book of shorter poems which incorporate \u201cepitaphs, love poems, verse-essays, commemorative prose, \u2018shooting scripts\u2019 for purported TV dramas and poems addressed to paintings,\u201d noted Publishers Weekly writer Stephen Burt, was met with great acclaim. Reviewing the collection for Salon, Kate Moses described it as a meditation on time, noting too that it \u201cencompasses all of that picnic that time spreads behind itself: life and sex and love and death.\u201d It was awarded the Griffin Poetry Prize and was a finalist for the Governor General\u2019s Literary Award and that National Book Critics Circle Award. In 2001 Carson also published The Beauty of the Husband: A Fictional Essay in 29 Tangos, a verse novel whose subject is \u201cthe waywardness of lust and the disaffection of the heart as seen through a marital breakup,\u201d as Daphne Merkin wrote. It also received high praise and was awarded the T.S. Eliot Prize. In 2000, Carson was awarded a MacArthur Foundation \u201cgenius\u201d grant\nSince her success of 2001, Carson has gone on to publish a volume of \u201cpoetry, essays and opera,\u201d Decreation (2005). Comprised of short lyrics, a screenplay, oratorio, and long prose sections that combine literary criticism with philosophical investigation, the book takes as its title and impetus an idea of the philosopher Simone Weil. As Carson explains, Weil\u2019s notion of \u201cdecreation\u201d is \u201can undoing of the creature in us\u2014that creature enclosed in self and defined by self.\u201d As Deryn Rees-Jones noted in the Independent, \u201cin decreating we would, in our extinction of the self, find a metaphysical fullness, in tune with the universe.\u201d Decreation received high praise from all quarters and Fiona Sampson, reviewing the book for the Guardian alleged that it \u201coutlines one of the most idiosyncratic intelligences at work in contemporary literature,\u201d and despite its genre-bending contents is \u201cmost of all\u2026inimitable poetry.\u201d\n\r\nCarson continues to be an important and exciting translator of classical writers. Grief Lessons: Four Plays by Euripides (2006) and An Oresteia (2009) both sparked critical debate. A shocking playwright in his time, Euripides reached his highest fame during the Peloponnesian War. Grief Lessons presents four of his lesser-known tragedies and offers \u201ca kind of primer on the intrinsic dangers of blind devotion to ideology,\u201d wrote Hilton Als in the New Yorker. A Publisher\u2019s Weekly reviewer found that \u201cCarson is nothing less than brilliant\u2014unfalteringly sharp in diction, audacious and judicious in taking liberties.\u201d Carson\u2019s next translation, An Oresteia, is a composite of plays dealing with the fate of the house of Atreus and includes Agamemnon by Aeshcylus, Electra by Sophocles and Orestes by Euripides. The volume received somewhat mixed reviews for just those liberties; Brad Leithauser in the New York Times Book Review found Carson\u2019s choice of diction irregular and often jarringly contemporary and \u201cfailed to find\u2026in Carson\u2019s translations a feeling of a composite whole. There are moments when her diction stoops so low I had trouble remembering I was dealing with men godlike in their splendor.\u201d Emily Wilson, in the Nation, found that though Carson as a scholar is acutely aware of the differences between the three tragedians, she \u201cdoes not entirely succeed in making them sound properly distinct from one another,\u201d though Wilson described Carson\u2019s translation as a \u201cmovement\u2026away from the clear ideology of Aeschylus\u2019 Oresteia toward the much more complex, ambiguous world of Euripides\u2019 Orestes,\u201d which makes the work all the more important and \u201cpertinent to the current political climate. \u201c\nSpeaking to poet-critic Stephanie Burt, Carson admitted that at heart she considers herself a visual, not verbal, artist: \u201cI didn\u2019t write very much at all until I guess my twenties because I drew. I just drew pictures, and sometimes wrote on them when I was young, but mostly I was interested in drawing. I never did think of myself as a writer!\u201d Even after several acclaimed volumes, \u201cI don\u2019t know that I do yet. I know that I have to make things. And it\u2019s a convenient form we have in our culture, the book, in which you can make stuff, but it\u2019s becoming less and less satisfying. And I\u2019ve never felt that it exhausts any idea I\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Canada"]}}
