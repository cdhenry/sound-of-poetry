An admirer of French poet Ren\u00e9 Char, Sobin arrived in Paris in 1962 to meet the poet who would become his mentor. With Char\u2019s assistance, Sobin purchased an abandoned silk cocoonery in Provence and made his home there. Using the language of negation and omission, Sobin explored existence and transcendence in his poetry. Reviewing Sobin\u2019s Collected Poems, Lucas Klein located Sobin\u2019s work within the sphere of late Objectivism, with the caveat, \u201cBut if Objectivism is about the object, Sobin\u2019s poetry is often equally about its opposite, the negated.\u201d Later in the same review, Klein observed, \u201cWith commas, hyphenations, and enjambment, he forces attention to the parts and particles, solid or hollow, that make up the words we know\u2014\u201cre- / member,\u201d \u201cwith- / out,\u201d \u201cab- / sence\u201d\u2014and our sense of being that comes from them.\u201d In an interview with Edward Foster, Sobin spoke of his experience of living in a Francophone country while writing in English, stating, \u201cIt\u2019s almost an advantage, living at a distance in which one\u2019s own language is used\u2014almost exclusively\u2014for writing. The words take on a kind of buoyancy, a kind of freshness. They\u2019re free of so much exhausted usage\u201d and \u201cday-to-day attrition.\u201dSobin\u2019s numerous collections of poetry include Wind Chrysalid\u2019s Rattle (1980), Breaths\u2019 Burials (1945), Towards the Blanched Alphabets (1998), and In the Name of the Neither (2002). Compilations of his poetry can be found in By the Bias of Sound: Selected Poems 1974\u20131994 (1995) and Collected Poems (posthumously, 2010). Sobin also translated Henri Michaux\u2019s Ideograms in China (1984) and Ren\u00e9 Char\u2019s The Brittle Age and Returning Upland (released in 2009 as a single, bilingual volume). His prose includes the novel The Fly-Truffler (2000) and the essay collections Luminous Debris (1999) and Ladder of Shadows (2009). Sobin lived in the south of France for more than 40 years. He died at the age of 69.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"]}}
