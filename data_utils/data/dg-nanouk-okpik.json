She earned a BFA at the Institute of American Indian Arts and an MFA at the University of Southern Maine\u2019s Stonecoast College.\r\n\u00a0\r\nOkpik\u2019s lyric pastoral poems are set in her native Alaskan landscape and concerned with movement and sensory precision; she often incorporates elements of mapmaking and mythology. In a 2013 review of Corpse Whale for Terrain.org: A Journal of the Built + Natural Environments, Dorine Jennette observed, \u201cIn okpik\u2019s hands, the English-language lyric\u2019s usual associative distances are radically compressed, so that persons and animals are one, places are one, times are one. It is difficult to discuss separately time or space or form-of-being in Corpse Whale, as okpik renders all such boundaries fluid. Each poem is a plunge into deep water.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nHer debut poetry collection, Corpse Whale (2012), won the American Book Award. Her work has also been featured in Effigies: An Anthology of Indigenous Writing from the Pacific Rim (2009) and Sing: Poetry from the Indigenous Americas (2011).\r\n\u00a0\r\nA recipient of the Truman Capote Trust Scholarship, she has taught at the Institute for American Indian Arts and has served as a resident advisor for the Santa Fe (New Mexico) Indian School. She lives in Santa Fe.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
