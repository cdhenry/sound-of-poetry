Born in Lancashire, England, she was raised by her grandparents, who were strict Seventh Day Adventists. Daley-Ward spent years struggling to make ends meet as a model. Because of industry racism in England, she moved to South Africa to pursue work. While there, she began writing and performing her own poetry. As she told the Guardian, \u201cIn acting and modelling I was so busy expressing what somebody else wanted that I\u2019d completely shut down my own voice. I didn\u2019t have any mirrors. When I was 20, I was in knots. I couldn\u2019t speak my reality to anybody. There\u2019s no cage now. Lots of people are afraid to tell the truth. But I don\u2019t care.\u201d\nDaley-Ward began posting poems to Instagram and soon gained a following. She self-published her first collection of poetry; Bone (2017) was subsequently republished by Penguin Books with a foreword from Kiese Laymon. Daley-Ward is also the author of the memoir The Terrible: A Storyteller\u2019s Memoir (2018).\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
