Jewett was born in 1849 in South Berwick, Maine, where she lived her entire life. She had a profound influence on the literary sensibilities of the American novelist Willa Cather. \u201cMy local attachments,\u201d Jewett wrote, \u201care stronger than any cat\u2019s that ever mewed.\u201d She wrote realistically but gently, creating what many critics regard as the best fictional narratives to come out of New England during a period when regional writing flourished there.\nAt age 19, Jewett published her first story and was soon encouraged by William Dean Howells to publish her stories as a book, which became the novel\u00a0Deephaven\u00a0(1877). Outstanding collections of stories and sketches followed:\u00a0Old Friends and New\u00a0(1879),\u00a0Country By-Ways\u00a0(1881),\u00a0A White Heron and Other Stories\u00a0(1886), and\u00a0A Native of Winby and Other Tales\u00a0(1893). At intervals Jewett wrote successful books for children, including\u00a0Play Days\u00a0(1878),\u00a0The Story of the Normans\u00a0(1887), and\u00a0Betty Leicester\u00a0(1890). Her novels included\u00a0A Country Doctor\u00a0(1884) and\u00a0A Marsh Island\u00a0(1885).\u00a0Her career continued to rise steadily and she became one of the most prominent literary figures of her time. \nThough primarily known for her prose work, her novel The Country of Pointed Firs (1896) in particular, Jewett is today also known for her poetry. Her poems were collected and published posthumously under the title Verses in 1916. Jewett\u2019s poetry is formal, features strong rhyme and meter, and often explores the deeper meaning of Maine\u2019s regional traditions. \nHer writing career ended after a carriage accident in 1902. Seven years later, she died in her hometown of South Berwick.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
