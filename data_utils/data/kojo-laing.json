In 2012, McSweeney\u2019s reissued\u00a0Search Sweet Country, with an introduction by Kenyan author and journalist Binyavanga Wainaina.\nOccasionally drawing on the techniques of surrealism, Laing\u2019s poetry addresses themes of alienation and identity. His novels likewise combine the real and supernatural, often in international settings. Laing received the National Poetry Prize Valco Award in 1976 and the National Novel Prize from the Ghana Association of Writers in 1985. In 2010 he traveled to Cape Town to write for Pilgrimages, a program sponsored by the Chinua Achebe Center for African Writers and Artists to foster writing about Africa during the 2010 World Cup.\r\n\u00a0\r\nLaing worked as headmaster in a school in Accra, the secretary to the Institute of African Studies at the University of Ghana, and chief executive of Family Schools in Accra. He died\u00a0in Ghana on April 20, 2017.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Africa"]}}
