The founder and longtime editor of the influential literary magazine Antaeus, Halpern is the president and publisher of Ecco Press, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. He is the author of many books of poetry, including Something Shining: Poems (1999), Foreign Neon (1991), Tango (1987), and Traveling on Credit (1972). Halpern\u2019s honors include fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. From 1975 to 1995, he taught in Columbia University\u2019s graduate writing program. He has also taught at Princeton University and The New School.\nHalpern\u2019s poems present daily life\u2014household tasks, nature, friends, pets\u2014in fresh, accessible language. Both Tango and Something Shining: Poems were praised for their formal ambition and control, as well as their revelation of the ordinary. Reviewer Frank Allen wrote in the Library Journal that the poems in Something Shining \u201creveal how much he cares about classic writers (Chekhov, Li Po,\u00a0Machado), the New England coast (\u2018the hillside terraced to the sea / with flowers\u2019), and things of light (in language and nature). Like art itself, the subjects of this poetry\u2014conversation, music, vintage wine\u2014are composed of \u2018things fitting together, whether in the hand / or mind.\u2019\u201d\nHalpern has edited anthologies of both poetry and prose, including Dante\u2019s Inferno: Translations by Twenty Contemporary Poets (1993). According to America contributor Andrew J. Krivak, the volume provides evidence of Dante\u2019s lasting influence in \u201can eclectic\u2014in the best sense of the word\u2014collaboration by some of the finest poets writing today.\u201d Halpern has also edited the short-fiction collections The Art of the Tale: An International Anthology of Short Stories, 1945\u20131985 (1986) and The Art of the Story: An International Anthology of Contemporary Short Stories (1999), which includes works by Bobbie Ann Mason, Joyce Carol Oates, and Martin Amis.\nHalpern lives in New York City and Princeton, New Jersey with his family.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
