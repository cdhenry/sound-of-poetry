His close study of Shakespeare led him to write almost exclusively in Shakespearian sonnets, and his sequences on religion and nature gained recognition for their graceful lyricism. However, Very\u2019s intense religious devotion soon led him to believe that he was Christ incarnate, or the messiah\u2014and that his poetry was the product of divine inspiration. He was dismissed from his studies at Harvard Divinity School over this declaration, and he was eventually admitted to an insane asylum. Years later, Very no longer felt he served as God\u2019s vessel; he retired to his family\u2019s home in Salem, Massachusetts, where he lived with his two sisters until his death.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
