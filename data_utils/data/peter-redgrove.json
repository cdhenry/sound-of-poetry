A poet, novelist, and playwright, Redgrove drew on his training as a scientist and science journalist to write collections of poetry marked by an attendance to the mystical roots of the natural world. Early collections such as The Collector (1959), At the White Monument (1963), and The Force (1966) can seem \u201ccut from an immense, rich fabric of imagination,\u201d Alan Brownjohn noted in his obituary of Redgrove, \u201cturning sometimes into chains of wild and wonderful conceits which desert the reality they set out to represent.\u201d Brownjohn placed Redgrove in an English visionary tradition that includes Henry Vaughan, Thomas Traherne, and William Blake.\nRedgrove\u2019s interests in modern psychology, particularly the work of post-Jungians such as John Layard, also influenced his writings, which knit together, in his words, \u201cdreamwork, sexual counselling, hypnotic induction, etc.\u201d With his second wife, the poet Penelope Shuttle, he authored a series of books that attempted to correct what he saw as contemporary misunderstandings of the human fertility cycle: The Wise Wound (1978), The Black Goddess and the Sixth Sense (1987), and Alchemy for Women (1995). Though Redgrove\u2019s preoccupations, \u201cwhich included magic, sex, nature, the landscape of Cornwall, religion and mysticism,\u201d struck some readers as bizarre, the Telegraph\u2019s memorial to Redgrove maintained \u201cthey were sincerely held interests which combined some of the priorities of Ted Hughes or Norman MacCaig with a precision which sprang from Redgrove's scientific background.\u201d\nRedgrove was born in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, and educated at Queen\u2019s College Cambridge, where he first met Ted Hughes, who became a lifelong friend. Redgrove was associated with Philip Hobsbaum and \u201cthe Group,\u201d a loose collection of poets pioneering a workshop-style salon in 1960s England. Redgrove himself held various university appointments throughout his career, teaching at SUNY Buffalo, Leeds University, Colgate University, and Falmouth College of Art. Neil Roberts edited Redgrove\u2019s Collected Poems and wrote his biography, A Lucid Dreamer: The Life of Peter Redgrove, both published in 2012.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
