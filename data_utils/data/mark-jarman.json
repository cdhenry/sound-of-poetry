He was born in 1952 in Mount Sterling, Kentucky. He earned a BA from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1974 and an MFA from the University of Iowa in 1976. Jarman is the author of numerous collections of poetry, including The Heronry (2017), Bone Fires: New and Selected Poems\u00a0(2011), Epistles\u00a0(2007), The Black Riviera (1990), which was awarded the Poets\u2019 Prize in 1991, and Questions for Ecclesiastes\u00a0(1997), which won the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. His many honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship, a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, and the Robert Frost Fellowship from the Bread Loaf Writers\u2019 Conference.\nMany of Jarman\u2019s formal, narrative poems explore his family history, faith, and his experiences as the son of a minister. His early collections, in particular, portray his own childhood, as well as those of his parents and grandparents. Jarman\u2019s books Iris\u00a0(1992), The Rote Walker\u00a0(1981), and North Sea\u00a0(1978) all include poems inspired by members of his family, such as his grandmother, Nora, a formative influence. His early work is frequently set in California or Scotland, both places where Jarman spent time in his youth. Jarman has noted that his poems are interested in \u201ctelling the stories of their subjects clearly.\u201d He cites\u00a0Edwin Arlington Robinson,\u00a0Robert Frost, and\u00a0Robinson Jeffers\u00a0as his influences.\nAlthough steeped in religion as a child, Jarman faced a period of ambivalence about his faith. After he started attending church with his wife and children, however, he experienced a renewal of his belief in God. Jarman wrote in an essay for\u00a0Contemporary Authors Autobiography Series\u00a0that though his wife\u2019s decision to attend church was not a religious one, for him \u201cit was a religious decision. It required admitting to myself that I still had a faith \u2026 As an epigraph to\u00a0The Rote Walker\u00a0I quoted two lines from\u00a0John Logan\u2019s poem \u2018The Spring of the Thief\u2019: \u2018When we speak of God, / Is it God we speak of?\u2019 I used to say flippantly that the answer to that profound question was \u2018Yes and no.\u2019 I no longer think the answer is flippant. It is just as profound as the question.\u201d\nJarman\u2019s lauded collection Questions for Ecclesiastes\u00a0(1997) responds to its Biblical source text and traces his rediscovery of his spirituality. In later books such as Unholy Sonnets\u00a0(2000) and\u00a0Epistles\u00a0(2007), Jarman interrogates and affirms his belief in God and wrestles with the concepts of salvation and miracles.\u00a0As noted in Publishers Weekly, in Jarman\u2019s collection The Heronry (2018), \u201cfaith reveals its multiform and complex nature through the people the poet meets. \u2026 With precision and tenderness, Jarman explores the sinew and soul of humankind.\u201d\nJarman has also written several collections of essays, all of which distill and illuminate his thoughts on narrative, craft, and form. \ufeffAccording to A.E. Stallings, Jarman\u2019s book of essays, Dailiness (2020), \u201cconjures up the quotidian, the everyday, the workaday, but also an elevated awareness of the present as we are in it mid-stream, and poetry as (in Auden\u2019s words) \u2018a way of happening.\u2019\u201d Jarman\u2019s other essay collections are The Secret of Poetry\u00a0(2001) and\u00a0Body and Soul\u00a0(2002).\nIn the 1980s, Jarman and his friend Robert McDowell founded and edited the\u00a0Reaper,\u00a0a magazine devoted to reclaiming and promoting poetry that emphasized story and image. The\u00a0Reaper\u00a0ceased publication in 1989. However, the press Jarman and McDowell founded, Story Line, which is now an imprint of Red Hen Press, continues to publish the works of emerging and established poets.\nJarman lives with his wife Amy Jarman in Nashville, Tennessee, where he is Centennial Professor of English at Vanderbilt University.\n", "attrs": {}}
