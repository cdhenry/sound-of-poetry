A reviewer for Critical Quarterly praised his first collection, The Astronomy of Love (1961), with the observation that Stallworthy shows \u201ca gift few poets possess, and which all poets wish for\u2014the ability to strike out a memorable and epigrammatic line which is at once simple and deeply disturbing.\u201d He published numerous volumes of poetry, including Rounding the Horn: Collected Poems (1998), Body Language (2004), and Survivors\u2019 Song: From Maldon to the Somme (2008), as well as a memoir, Singing School: The Making of a Poet (1998). Stallworthy\u2019s poems often employ conventional forms in their sophisticated examinations of war, England, and family.\nStallworthy was one of his generation's most respected editors and critics. He edited Yeats: Last Poems: A Casebook (1968) and has also published critical studies on Yeats, for which he received the M.L. Rosenthal Award. His biography of Wilfred Owen (1974) was honored with the Duff Cooper Memorial Prize, the W.H. Smith Literary Award, and the E.M. Forster Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He also edited Owen\u2019s Complete Poems and Fragments (1984) and Henry Reed\u2019s Collected Poems. Stallworthy\u2019s biography Louis MacNeice: A Biography (1995) won the Southern Arts Literature Prize.\nStallworthy edited and coedited numerous anthologies, including The Norton Anthology of Poetry (1996, with Margaret Ferguson and Mary Jo Salter), A Book of Love Poetry (1974), and The Oxford Book of War Poetry (1984, 2014). He cotranslated, with Peter France, Alexandr Blok\u2019s Selected Poems (1970, originally titled The Twelve and Other Poems) and Boris Pasternak\u2019s Selected Poems (1983).\nFormerly the poetry editor of Oxford University Press, Stallworthy was a professor of English at the University of Oxford and Cornell University, and a Fellow of the British Academy and of the Royal Society of Literature.\u00a0He died in 2014.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
