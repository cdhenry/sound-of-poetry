She is the author of Interior with Sudden Joy (1999), Human Dark with Sugar (2008), winner of the James Laughlin Award from the Academy of American Poets, Our Andromeda (2012), So Much Synth (2016), and The Octopus Museum (2019). Her work has appeared in the Yale Review, the Boston Review, McSweeney\u2019s, and Best American Poetry, among other places.\nShaughnessy\u2019s work is known for its ability to twin opposites: her poems are both playful and erotic, lyrical and funny, formal and strange. Reviewing Human Dark with Sugar, poet Cate Peebles noted that \u201cShaughnessy draws attention to the contradiction of being made up of so many parts while appearing to be one single body.\u201d In the New Yorker, Hilton Als said of her book, Our Andromeda: \u201cit further establishes Shaughnessy\u2019s particular genius, which is utterly poetic, but essayistic in scope, encompassing ideas about astronomy, illness, bodies, the family, \u2018normalcy,\u2019 home.\u201d\n\r\nShaughnessy has received numerous honors and awards for her work, including fellowships from the Radcliffe Institute, where she was a Bunting Fellow, the Japan/U.S. Friendship Commission, and the Howard Foundation of Brown University. She has taught at universities including Columbia, the New School, Princeton, and New York University. Shaughnessy is currently an associate professor of English at Rutgers University-Newark.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
