He became the youngest poet to receive the Yale Younger Poets prize, for his book The Deer Come Down (1936). Weismiller earned a BA from Cornell College, an MA from Harvard University, and a DPhil from Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes scholar. He served in counterespionage during World War II, and afterward declined to join the newly formed CIA. He opted to teach poetry and creative writing at Pomona College.\nDuring his lifetime, Weismiller published five books of poetry, as well as the novel The Serpent Sleeping (1998), before retiring in 1980. Poet W.S. Merwin has praised Weismiller for his \u201cfull front self-appraisal, neither mocking for whining\u201d and the \u201cnakedness, humor\u201d of his verse.\u00a0He died in 2010.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
