He learned Spanish from his grandmother, who spoke it fluently. Honig earned a BA and an MA from the University of Wisconsin. He taught at Harvard University, and at Brown University, where he founded the creative writing program. He is noted for his comprehensive analysis and translations of literary works, primarily plays and poetry, from Spanish and Portuguese into English. A poet himself, his earliest translations were of the poems of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca and of plays by the Spanish writers Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca and Miguel de Cervantes. In Calder\u00f3n and the Seizures of Honor, a critical study published in 1972, Honig attempts to make the great 17th-century playwright relevant to the modern reader. A critic for the Virginia Quarterly Review described Honig\u2019s work as \u201ccarefully researched and thought out, with a deep understanding of the Spanish code of honor in history. Honig\u2019s work is more than just another defense of a forgotten playwright. It has the quality of insight and richness of expressions needed to reinvest Calder\u00f3n with the excitement his plays once insured.\u201d Honig\u2019s translation of Cervantes\u2019 Eight Interludes (1964) is also considered a first-rate rendition of the fast-moving and realistic plays.\nHonig\u2019s poetry is respected for the same attention to detail and style evident in his criticism and translation work. Library Journal critic Dabney Stuart explained that Honig is \u201ca master of tone: The sound of the voice is casual, rambling, but the poems are carefully structured. Each has a control enabling Honig to weave disparate stuff into his cloth.\u201d In his review of Survivals, W.T. Scott remarked in Saturday Review that Honig\u2019s \u201clean, muscular style, his way of lifting a small thing into significance\u2014these are no mean gifts. \u2018Fall of a House\u2019 perhaps exhibits him at his haunting best. ... \u2018The Island\u2019 is a remarkable instance of the way he can sustain a poem with subtle, constant music. And at the close of the book his poems of love and death are moving with an eloquence beyond rhetoric.\u201d According to Daniel Hughes in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, \u201cHonig has been a poet whose sorrow is always coming home. ... No poet of our time has more fiercely presented man\u2019s tragic mortality even as he finds an impressive variety of means by which that mortality is admitted and sublimed.\u201d\nHonig\u2019s use of humor is another aspect of his writings that has attracted much attention and analysis. Laurence Lieberman pointed out in Poetry that \u201cthe jet stream of Honig\u2019s loquaciousness is tempered by the fine cutting edge of his wit, and the interplay of these two constitutional leanings of his personality furnishes his long spiraling verse sentences with astonishing permeability to experience.\u201d\nHonig once told Contemporary Authors that his interest in poetry began suddenly when he was 12. \u201cIn the winter I was reading Tom Swift and the Frank Packard books,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn the spring I began reading Eliot, Auden, and Crane. Writing poetry became an activity like collecting stamps or marbles.\u201d Honig sees the aim of poetry as restoring the awareness of being both human and animal, and capturing historical perspective. Poetry, moreover, should contain an element of shock; \u201cwhile good poetry should not leave one shaking or in a state of abjection, ... it should shake one to the roots of his being.\u201d\nHonig died in Providence, Rhode Island, on May 25, 2011.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
