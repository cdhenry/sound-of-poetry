In his youth, Barnfield was deeply influenced by Virgil\u2019s work and the 1591 publication of Sir Philip Sidney\u2019s Astrophel and Stella, which popularized the sonnet sequence. Best known for his poem \u201cAs it fell upon a day,\u201d Barnfield is the only Elizabethan male poet apart from Shakespeare\u2014whom he admired\u2014to address love poems to a man.Little is known about Barnfield\u2019s life and career, but it is thought that his maternal aunt raised him and his sister after his mother died during childbirth. In 1592 he graduated from Brasenose College, Oxford. At the age of 21 he published his first two books, The Affectionate Shepherd (1594) and Cynthia (1595), both addressed to \u201cGanymede.\u201d Originally published anonymously, The Affectionate Shepherd expands upon Virgil\u2019s second eclogue, and its homoerotic themes made Barnfield\u2019s poems controversial for his time. Just two months after The Affectionate Shepherd, Barnfield published Cynthia, modeling his collection\u2014which includes a 20-sonnet sequence\u2014after the poems of Spenser and Shakespeare. He published his third and final book, The Encomion of Lady Pecunia (1598), at age 24.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Renaissance"]}}
