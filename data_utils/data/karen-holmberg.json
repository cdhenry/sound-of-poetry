She is the author of The Perseids (2001), winner of the Vassar Miller Prize in poetry, and Axis Mundi (2012), which won the John Ciardi Prize. Her other honors include a Discovery/The Nation award.  \u00a0 Interested in the intersections of lyric and creative nonfiction, poetry and science, and letterpress printing and visual space, Holmberg has compared her writing process to \u201csketching.\u201d In an interview she noted, \u201cThe most difficult part of writing for me is resisting the urge to push and force the poem into some form that\u2019s alien to it. I love the sensation of gradually becoming so absorbed and invested in solving the puzzle of the poem that writing no longer registers as difficult. Then I know I will get it right.\u201d Holmberg is an associate professor at Oregon State University.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
