Purpura also translated the Grzegorz Musial collections Berliner Tagebuch and Taste of Ash (1998).  \u00a0 Purpura\u2019s honors and awards include fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Fulbright Foundation, the MacDowell Colony, and the Maryland State Arts Council.
