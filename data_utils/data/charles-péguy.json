He combined fervent Catholicism with socialist politics to create a body of work unlike any other. As a Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism writer suggested, \u201cMost critics find that P\u00e9guy\u2019s literary works exist outside the mainstream of modern French literature.\u201d George E. Gingras, writing in the Encyclopedia of World Literature, noted, \u201cUltimately unclassifiable, P\u00e9guy was a solitary, best remembered for resisting all forces seeking to make political capital out of moral issues.\u201d P\u00e9guy composed lengthy poems and plays, but philosophical journalism is his trademark.\nMuch of P\u00e9guy\u2019s journalism, which he published in his own magazine, Cahiers de la quinzaine, argues the principles of P\u00e9guysme, his own blend of ideas. Gingras defined P\u00e9guysme as \u201ca deeply personalist philosophy combining socialism, patriotism, and Catholicism. Less a systematic analysis than a stream of conscious meditation on the theme of the modern world, P\u00e9guysme constituted an organic body of thought that took shape in three distinct stages: (1) a formative period (1896\u20131904), culminating in a series of Cahiers attacking the anticlericalism and statism of modern secular society; (2) the critical middle years (1905\u201309), during which P\u00e9guy defined the situation of the modern world, while formulating in opposition to it a value system grounded in Henri Bergson\u2019s metaphysics, classical humanism, the traditions of old France, and a spirituality free of clericalism; (3) the major phase (1910\u201314), when he employed all his talent as an essayist, dramatist, and poet to chart for a reinvigorated nation the mystical vocation he envisaged as hers.\u201d Though P\u00e9guy\u2019s ideas are idiosyncratic, they reflect his era. As a Guide to French Literature reviewer explained, \u201c[P\u00e9guy\u2019s] particular constellation of attitudes can only be understood in the light of his peasant and artisan background, his love of Catholic, rural, and provincial French life, the sheer ordinariness of his experience, and his acuteness as an undisciplined and self-taught thinker in search of spirituality.\u201d\nP\u00e9guy\u2019s father died when he was less than a year old, so he was raised by his mother and grandmother. As the Guide to French Literature writer explained, P\u00e9guy\u2019s background was working class, and educationally innocent: \u201cHis grandmother could neither read nor write, and his mother left school at 10.\u201d P\u00e9guy, however, studied seriously at the lyc\u00e9e of Orleans, where he learned classical languages and philosophy. Through various scholarships and grants, P\u00e9guy managed to attend the Lyc\u00e9e Lakanal in Paris, where he planned to work toward entry to the \u00c9cole Normale Superi\u00e9ure, the top school for educators in France. When he failed the \u00c9cole\u2019s entrance exam, he joined the military before preparing for the exam again, at the College Sainte-Barbe. He was accepted to the \u00c9cole Normale Superi\u00e9ure in 1894, where he began to develop socialist leanings and break from the Catholic Church.\nP\u00e9guy left the \u00c9cole Normale Superi\u00e9ure in 1895 to study further the life of Joan of Arc. The Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism writer explained,\u00a0\u201cHis lifelong inspiration was Joan of Arc, and it is through his dramatizations of this saint\u2019s spiritual ordeals that P\u00e9guy best expressed his own religious crises and development.\u201d His work on Joan of Arc, particularly his prose drama trilogies, emphasizes her spiritual development; the Guide to French Literature reviewer suggested that \u201cHis aim [was] to uncover the personality and motivation of the historical figure rather than to analyze the known facts.\u201d When he returned to the \u00c9cole, he was ripe to be radicalized by the events of the Dreyfus affair, in which Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish captain in the French military, was falsely convicted accused of treason in 1894 and exonerated twelve years later.\nIn 1896, P\u00e9guy\u2019s close friend, Marcel Baudouin, died. P\u00e9guy left the \u00c9cole the next year to teach Baudouin\u2019s sister, Charlotte. Against the will of the families, P\u00e9guy then married her. Because of Mmes. P\u00e9guy and Baudouin\u2019s disapproval, they were married in a civil ceremony and their children would not be baptized. P\u00e9guy ended his formal education, opened a socialist bookstore and began to write. But while he maintained his socialist ideas, he broke with the Socialist party when it would not back Dreyfus entirely. P\u00e9guy thus began his own journal in 1900, which he called his \u201cjournal of truth.\u201d\nIn the journal, Cahiers de la quinzaine, P\u00e9guy published all of his thoughts. The Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism writer noted, \u201cP\u00e9guy\u2019s polemical essays published in the Cahiers were usually protests against the bourgeois values of the modern world, often bitterly attacking the government, officials of the Catholic Church, the academic community, and the Socialist party.\u201d Moreover, the journal dealt with P\u00e9guy\u2019s lifelong obsessions: Christianity, philosophy, patriotism, the Dreyfus affair and other issues. The Guide to French Literature writer said, \u201cThere were 15 series and 229 issues of the Cahiers, which published plays, novels, short stories, and poetry, dreams of world peace and Jewish poetry, considerations about the inevitability of war, Greek myths, extracts from Bergson and Benda\u2019s attack on Bergson, revolutionary diaries, translations of Shakespeare, and articles on Michelangelo and Beethoven.\u201d But despite the journal\u2019s breadth, P\u00e9guy maintained a lifelong interest in French Christian identity, which he explored through the Dreyfus affair, Joan of Arc and Christian myth.\nP\u00e9guy also maintained his interest in Joan of Arc. In Le myst\u00e8re de la charite de Jeanne d\u2019Arc (1910), P\u00e9guy describes Joan\u2019s spiritual development through a series of dialogues. Edward Wagenknecht, writing in the Chicago Sunday Tribune, summarized: \u201cThe work is partly in a highly rhetorical, \u2018poetic\u2019 kind of prose with a long dialog between Joan and her friend, Hauviette, who is the conventional Christian, and passes on to a longer dialog between Joan and Madame Gervaise, who is the Church ... the culminating passage ... is a meditation of the Savior\u2019s Passion.\u201d When Julian Green, P\u00e9guy\u2019s primary translator, translated the work into English in 1950, Americans responded to P\u00e9guy\u2019s singular writing with either delight or horror. \u201cMany readers will grow impatient with this book,\u201d Wagenknecht warned, \u201cbut if they have any devotional spirit at all it will capture them before the end. At one point, they will probably declare that they admire P\u00e9guy\u2019s content but detest his style ... It is essentially an oral style; to realize its full power, one should read aloud. A good reader might well achieve a tremendous almost hypnotic effect, closer to that of the chant than to anything most of us are likely to think of as literature.\u201d J.W. Brush wrote in the Crozer Quarterly, \u201cDear reader, this book is like no other you ever saw. It purports to be a play in one act, with three characters and no action. ... Its style of incantation and repetition makes it a burden to read alone ... When this is said, however, the rest must be to acknowledge it as a work of genius, and to counsel the cultivation of the right point of view for its profitable use. It is really a work of devotion.\u201d Other critics were less admiring; Rene Blanc-Roos wrote in the Nation, \u201cOne must point out that this babble soon becomes horribly tedious.\u201d\nP\u00e9guy\u2019s writing style won him both praise and disregard. Some critics dismissed him as repetitive; others lauded him as a uniquely brilliant stylist. Mary Duclaux, writing in Twentieth Century French Writers, described his place in French literature: \u201cshall we say that P\u00e9guy was the Walt Whitman of France? Shall we translate him into English under the name of Carlyle\u2014or even W.E. Henley? There was something of all of them in the irascible, quizzical, and lovable idealist whose life was one long struggle against conventional standards and a conventional style.\u201d William A. Drake, in his book Contemporary European Writers, noted, \u201cIt is difficult, in estimating the contribution of Charles P\u00e9guy to French literature and to the French spirit, to escape the temptation to overemphasis which has caused most of his contemporaries to invest this lovable and significant figure with the same sort of monumental halo which adorns the metaphorical brow of his compatriot of Orleans, Jeanne d\u2019Arc.\u201d Harry Levin of the Sewanee Review commented, Charles P\u00e9guy \u201cupsets all preconceptions of a French writer ... the academic precisian, the cynical rationalist. P\u00e9guy ... is their very antithesis.\u201d Writing in a chanting rhythm in simple, repetitive phrases about the traditions of old, Christian France, P\u00e9guy delights those who enjoy the representation, in simple words, of exalted thoughts.\nP\u00e9guy wrote until the outbreak of World War I, when he was one of the first soldiers to be sent into battle. He died at Marne in 1914, further sanctifying his name. His obsessions and simple writing style make P\u00e9guy\u2019s work singular. As a polemicist and poet devoted to Christian French identity, however, P\u00e9guy has his niche among French writers.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"]}}
