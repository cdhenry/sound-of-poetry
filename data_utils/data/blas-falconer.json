He is the author of the poetry collections\u00a0A Question of Gravity and Light\u00a0(2007) and\u00a0The Foundling Wheel\u00a0(2012).\u00a0The poems in his debut collection\u00a0utilize both free verse and received forms to explore themes of sexuality, otherness, and loss. In a voice \u201cat once detached and enlivened,\u201d critic Yasmin Nair observes in a 2008 review of A Question of Gravity and Light for the Windy City Times, Falconer has created \u201ca set of pieces whose apparent lightness belies the burden of grief and longing experienced by the narrator(s).\u201d Speaking to the unifying principle behind the poems in A Question of Gravity and Light during an interview with poet Steven Cordoba for the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Institute for Latino Studies, Falconer notes, \u201cI realized that the metaphor of crossing spoke to all of the conflicts within the book, regardless of subject matter. So the recurring metaphor, not subject, became the organizing principle, and I saw each poem existing somewhere on that continuum between departure and arrival.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nFalconer\u00a0has edited poetry for the literary journal Zone 3, has been an editor with Zone 3 Press, and co-edited Mentor and Muse: Essays from Poets to Poets (2010, with Beth Martinelli and Helena Mesa).\u00a0His honors include the Maureen Egen Literary Award from Poets & Writers, the New Delta Review Eyster Prize for Poetry, and the Barthelme Fellowship.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFalconer has taught at Austin Peay State University and the Tennessee Young Writers\u2019 Workshop. He lives in Nashville, Tennessee.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"]}}
