In his formal and free verse poems, he often engages themes of power, intimacy, and natural order. \u201cFeld is an exacting poet whose poems are capable of holding at once the most intense, objective sensory detail and the most elusive and ethically ambivalent mental exercise,\u201d notes Lisa Russ Spaar in a 2013 review of Raptor for the Los Angeles Review of Books. Spaar continues, \u201cThe pitch of formal verge and the float of personal and political trespass in Feld\u2019s inaugural text finds renewed ardor in his second, a passionately pent meditation on wild(er)ness and restraint.\u201d In a 2014 interview with Anna Knowles for the blog Poem of the Week, Feld states, \u201cTo be a contemporary citizen in our republic is to feel a constant sense of hopelessness and impotent rage at the vile Capitalists who are destroying our planet for short-term profit. Poetry reminds you that the world does not have to be the way it is, that community is possible and necessary.\u201d\u00a0\nFeld is the author of the poetry collections Citizen (2004), which was chosen for the National Poetry Series, and Raptor (2012). His work was anthologized in The Best American Poetry 2005.\nThe recipient of a Wallace Stegner Fellowship, a \u201cDiscovery\u201d/The Nation Award, and two Pushcart Prizes, Feld has served as editor in chief and poetry editor for the Seattle Review at the University of Washington, where he is an associate professor and director of the creative writing program. He lives in Seattle.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
