She earned a BA from the University of Iowa and MFA from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Xu\u2019s collection You Are Not Dead\u00a0(2013) was profiled as one of the year\u2019s best debuts by\u00a0Poets & Writers Magazine; her second collection of poetry is\u00a0Phrasis\u00a0(Fence, 2017), winner of the Ottoline Prize.\u00a0Her work has appeared in\u00a0The Best American Poetry 2013, Boston Review, Poetry, A Public Space, BOMB,\u00a0and was selected for a Patricia Goedicke Prize in Poetry by\u00a0D.A. Powell.\n\r\nXu frequently uses line breaks as sharp hinges in single-stanza, meditative poems that embrace the ephemeral nature of intimacy. \u201cXu\u2019s poems deftly navigate the space between the often-obscured personal and the dominant external. The concrete world is in the spotlight while the personal and confessional take place off stage\u2014far away enough that we can see hints of it, but not so close that we comprehend the details we\u2019re presented with in a narrative sense,\u201d observed Raena Shirali in a 2014 review of\u00a0You Are Not Dead for the\u00a0Journal. In a 2012 interview with John Hoppenthaler, Xu stated, \u201cI think language is always waiting patiently on us to engage it, to play with it and arrange its parts, to build something weird out of it, but the hardest time to stop and think to do this is any space outside of poems. To \u2018negotiate\u2019 with a poem is right\u2014it says things, you say something back, you say YES! or you say OH NO, but the two of you build the complete experience together. I always like when part of a poem\u2019s contribution to the negotiation is a pseudo-\u2018normal\u2019 syntax, if it seems aware and proud of its glitch, and if it wants to subvert my normalized expectations at every turn.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nXu is poetry editor for\u00a0Hyperallergic,\u00a0and in 2014 she was awarded a\u00a0Ruth Lilly and Dorothy Sargent Rosenberg Poetry fellowship from the Poetry Foundation.\u00a0She is a visiting assistant professor of writing in poetry and the New School and lives in Brooklyn.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
