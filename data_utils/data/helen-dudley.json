Dudley and her sister Dorothy (Dudley) Harvey wrote poetry and published poems in the first edition of Poetry; Helen\u2019s poems were included in Harriet Monroe\u2019s New Poetry: An Anthology (1917).\u00a0\r\nIn the early teens, Helen Dudley studied Greek at Oxford University. She and the philosopher Bertrand Russell began an affair in 1914; Dudley moved to England to be with Russell, but the affair ended during World War I, a shock from which she apparently never recovered. Her portrait, painted by Vanessa Bell around 1915, is at the Tate Gallery. \ufeff\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
