Her father, the Italian poet and political exile Gabriele Rossetti, immigrated to England in 1824 and established a career as a Dante scholar and teacher of Italian in London. He married the half-English, half-Italian Frances Polidori in 1826, and they had four children in quick succession: Maria Francesca in 1827, Gabriel Charles Dante (famous under the name Dante Gabriel but always called Gabriel by family members) in 1828, William Michael in 1829, and Christina Georgina on 5 December 1830. In 1831 Gabriele Rossetti was appointed to the chair of Italian at the newly opened King\u2019s College. The children received their earliest education, and Maria and Christina all of theirs, from their mother, who had been trained as a governess and was committed to cultivating intellectual excellence in her family. Certainly this ambition was satisfied: Maria was the author of a respected study of Dante, as well as books on religious instruction and Italian grammar and translation; Dante Gabriel distinguished himself as one of the foremost poets and painters of his era; and William was a prolific art and literary critic, editor, and memoirist of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Christina became one of the Victorian age\u2019s finest poets. She was the author of numerous books of poetry, including Goblin Market and other Poems (1862), The Prince\u2019s Progress (1866), A Pageant (1881), and The Face of the Deep (1882).\nRossetti\u2019s poetry has never disappeared from view. Critical interest in Rossetti\u2019s poetry swelled in the final decades of the twentieth century, a resurgence largely impelled by the emergence of feminist criticism; much of this commentary focuses on gender issues in her poetry and on Rossetti as a woman poet. In Rossetti\u2019s lifetime opinion was divided over whether she or\u00a0Elizabeth Barrett Browning\u00a0was the greatest female poet of the era; in any case, after Browning\u2019s death in 1861 readers and critics saw Rossetti as the older poet\u2019s rightful successor. The two poets achieved different kinds of excellence, as is evident in\u00a0Dante Gabriel Rossetti\u2018s comment on his sister, quoted by William Sharp in\u00a0The Atlantic Monthly\u00a0(June 1895): \u201cShe is the finest woman-poet since Mrs. Browning, by a long way; and in artless art, if not in intellectual impulse, is greatly Mrs. Browning\u2019s superior.\u201d Readers have generally considered Rossetti\u2019s poetry less intellectual, less political, and less varied than Browning\u2019s; conversely, they have acknowledged Rossetti as having the greater lyric gift, with her poetry displaying a perfection of diction, tone, and form under the guise of utter simplicity.\nRossetti\u2019s childhood was exceptionally happy, characterized by affectionate parental care and the creative companionship of older siblings. In temperament she was most like her brother Dante Gabriel: their father called the pair the \u201ctwo storms\u201d of the family in comparison to the \u201ctwo calms,\u201d Maria and William. Christina was given to tantrums and fractious behavior, and she fought hard to subdue this passionate temper. Years later, counseling a niece subject to similar outbursts, the mature Christina looked back on the fire now stifled: \u201cYou must not imagine, my dear girl, that your Aunt was always the calm and sedate person you now behold. I, too, had a very passionate temper; but I learnt to control it. On one occasion, being rebuked by my dear Mother for some fault, I seized upon a pair of scissors, and ripped up my arm to vent my wrath. I have learnt since to control my feelings\u2014and no doubt you will!\u201d Self-control was, indeed, achieved\u2014perhaps too much so. In his posthumous memoir of his sister that prefaces\u00a0The Poetical Works of Christina Georgina Rossetti\u00a0(1904) William laments the thwarting of her high spirits: \u201cIn innate character she was vivacious, and open to pleasurable impressions; and, during her girlhood, one might readily have supposed that she would develop into a woman of expansive heart, fond of society and diversions, and taking a part in them of more than average brilliancy. What came to pass was of course quite the contrary.\u201d As an adult Christina Rossetti was considered by many to be overscrupulous and excessively restrained.\nFrances Rossetti read to her children, favoring religious texts such as the Bible,\u00a0John Bunyan\u2018s\u00a0The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress\u00a0(1678), and the writings of St. Augustine, or moralistic tales such as those by Maria Edgeworth. When the children began reading for themselves, however, they generally shunned their mother\u2019s edifying selections in favor of the imaginative delights of\u00a0The Arabian Nights\u00a0or Thomas Keightley\u2019s\u00a0Fairy Mythology\u00a0(1828); later favorites included Sir Walter Scott, Ann Radcliffe, and Matthew Gregory \u201cMonk\u201d Lewis. Until 1836, when the boys began attending day school, the four children were offered similar instruction by their mother; thereafter, only Dante Gabriel and William were formally instructed in classics, mathematics, and sciences. Asked to describe her poetic influences, Rossetti speculated in a 26 March 1884 letter to Edmund Gosse: \u201cIf any one thing schooled me in the direction of poetry, it was perhaps the delightful idle liberty to prowl all alone about my grandfather\u2019s cottage-grounds some thirty miles from London.\u201d At Gaetano Polidori\u2019s cottage at Holmer Green she fostered the attention to the minute in nature that marks her poetry; there she also observed the corruptibility and mortality that became keynotes in her work. Her reminiscences in\u00a0Time Flies: A Reading Diary\u00a0(1885) include reflections on childhood adventures at the cottage: her patient attendance on a strawberry, only to find it blighted before it has fully ripened, and her burial of a dead mouse and later observation of its decay. The visits to Holmer Green ended in 1839 when her grandfather sold the house and moved to London. A great lover of nature, Rossetti nevertheless spent most of her life in the city.\nIn his memoir William notes that Christina composed her first verse, \u201cCecilia never went to school / Without her gladiator,\u201d before she was old enough to write. Her next attempt was an aborted tale, modeled on\u00a0The Arabian Nights, about a dervish named Hassan; and she wrote her first poem, \u201cTo my Mother on her Birthday,\u201d when she was eleven. The children produced a family newspaper, \u201cThe Hodge-Podge or Weekly Efforts,\u201d the first issue of which was dated 20 May 1843, and later a periodical titled \u201cThe Illustrated Scrapbook.\u201d Christina\u2019s early poetic efforts included experiments in lyric, devotional, pastoral, ballad, and fantasy forms.\nCaught up in the Tractarian or Oxford Movement when it reached London in the 1840s, the Rossettis shifted from an Evangelical to an Anglo-Catholic orientation, and this outlook influenced virtually all of Christina Rossetti\u2019s poetry. She was also influenced by the poetics of the Oxford Movement, as is documented in the annotations and illustrations she added to her copy of John Keble\u2019s\u00a0The Christian Year\u00a0(1827) and in her reading of poetry by Isaac Williams and John Henry Newman. For more than twenty years, beginning in 1843, she worshiped at Christ Church, Albany Street, where services were influenced by the innovations emanating from Oxford. The Reverend William Dodsworth, the priest there until his conversion to Catholicism in 1850, assumed a leading role as the Oxford Movement spread to London. In addition to coming under the religious influence of prominent Tractarians such as Dodsworth, W. J. E. Bennett, Henry W. Burrows, and E. B. Pusey, Rossetti had close personal ties with Burrows and Richard Frederick Littledale, a High Church theologian who became her spiritual adviser. The importance of Rossetti\u2019s faith for her life and art can hardly be overstated. More than half of her poetic output is devotional, and the works of her later years in both poetry and prose are almost exclusively so. The inconstancy of human love, the vanity of earthly pleasures, renunciation, individual unworthiness, and the perfection of divine love are recurring themes in her poetry.\nGabriele Rossetti\u2019s health collapsed in 1843, leaving him virtually blind and unable to teach. Frances Rossetti returned to her former employment as a daily governess. Maria and William also took employment, Maria as a nursery governess and William in the civil service. Dante Gabriel continued his art studies, while Christina remained at home as a companion to their ailing father. In 1845 she, too, suffered a collapse in health. The breakdown has mystified biographers, some of whom have surmised that the physical symptoms were psychosomatic and rescued Rossetti from having to make a financial contribution to the family by working as a governess like her mother and sister. She was diagnosed as having a heart condition, but another doctor speculated that she was mentally ill, suffering from a kind of religious mania. Her biographer Jan Marsh conjectures that there may have been an attempt at paternal incest: the father\u2019s breakdown and the resultant changes in family fortunes leaving a needy patriarch in the daily care of his pubescent daughter, Christina\u2019s recurring bouts of depression, her lifelong sense of sinfulness, nightmarish poems about a crocodile devouring his kin, a poetic image of a \u201cclammy fin\u201d repulsively reaching out to her, and the recurring motif of an unnameable secret, Marsh suggests, could be indications of suppressed sexual trauma. Rossetti had bouts of serious illness throughout her life; William insists in his memoir that one cannot understand his sister unless one recognizes that she \u201cwas an almost constant and often a sadly-smitten invalid.\u201d The morbidity that readers have so often noted in her poetry, William suggests, was attributable to Christina\u2019s ill health and the ever-present prospect of early death rather than any innate disposition.\u00a0\nBy her sixteenth birthday Christina, who was regarded as the poet in the family, had written more than fifty poems that were transcribed into a notebook by her sister. In 1847 a collection of her poems, titled\u00a0Verses, was privately printed by her grandfather Polidori. As Marsh points out, this private publication, dedicated to her mother, decorously avoided anything resembling public display, but at the same time it constituted a juvenile literary debut in the tradition of other women poets such as Browning and Felicia Hemans. It was circulated among family and friends and was well received. The thirty-nine poems are notably literary in their inspiration, which is traceable to the Gothic writers Radcliffe, Lewis, and Charles Maturin; the English poets\u00a0George Herbert, George Crabbe,\u00a0William Blake,\u00a0Samuel Taylor Coleridge,\u00a0Percy Bysshe Shelley,\u00a0John Keats, and\u00a0Alfred, Lord Tennyson; and the Italian poets Dante, Torquato Tasso, and Pietro Metastasio. The first and most striking poem in the collection is \u201cThe Dead City,\u201d an ambitious 275-line dream vision of a magnificent city, succulent banquet, and voluptuous revelers all turned to stone, the evocative descriptions of which anticipate the Pre-Raphaelite style. Here, as in Rossetti\u2019s most famous poem, \u201cGoblin Market\u201c (1862), lusciously described fruits represent the temptations of self-indulgence and pleasure. This genre\u2014a narrative that combines fantasy with moral allegory\u2014was an important one for Rossetti, and she employed it in more-accomplished poems such as \u201cGoblin Market,\u201d \u201cFrom House to Home,\u201d \u201cThe Prince\u2019s Progress,\u201d and \u201cA Ballad of Boding,\u201d as well as in her tales \u201cNick,\u201d \u201cHero,\u201d and\u00a0Speaking Likenesses, with Pictures thereof by Arthur Hughes\u00a0(1874). A morbid strain can be seen in many of the poems in the collection: themes of mortality, inconstancy, and corruptibility figure prominently. Although Rossetti\u2019s mature style is not fully realized at this point,\u00a0Verses\u00a0is important as a tangible sign of her commitment to poetry and of her family\u2019s recognition of her vocation.\u201d\nLater in 1847 Dante Gabriel, William, and Christina began a tradition of playing\u00a0bouts rim\u00e9s,\u00a0a game in which two of them would race to compose a sonnet conforming to a set of line endings provided by the third. Christina excelled at the exercise, composing sonnets in a matter of minutes. In 1848 she had her first taste of fame when, at Dante Gabriel\u2019s instigation, she submitted two of her poems, \u201cDeath\u2019s Chill Between\u201d and \u201cHeart\u2019s Chill Between,\u201d to the prestigious literary periodical\u00a0The Athenaeum;\u00a0their acceptance made her a nationally published poet at seventeen. During this period Dante Gabriel was gathering around him the circle of young men who named themselves the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Although he assumed that Christina would participate, she was never a member of this artistic and literary group; she even refused to have her work read aloud in her absence at its meetings, on the grounds that such display was unseemly. Nevertheless, her poetry has been described as \u201cPre-Raphaelite\u201d in its rich and precise natural detail, its use of symbol, its poignancy, and its deliberate medievalism. Later in her career a reviewer in the\u00a0Catholic World\u00a0(October 1876) called her the \u201cqueen of the Preraphaelite school\u201d; but more-recent critics have remarked that the Pre-Raphaelite elements in Rossetti\u2019s work have been overemphasized at the expense of proper notice of the Tractarian influences. Certainly, Rossetti was involved in the early days of Pre-Raphaelitism. She sat as Mary for Dante Gabriel\u2019s paintings\u00a0The Girlhood of Mary Virgin\u00a0(1848-1849) and\u00a0Ecce Ancilla Domini!\u00a0(1850), and her pensive Italianate countenance was a familiar image in the first phase of the movement. The art and poetry of the brotherhood has a strong sacramental element, and Rossetti had more in common with this early manifestation of the Pre-Raphaelite aesthetic than she did with its later developments.\nLate in 1849 the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood initiated a periodical,\u00a0The Germ, as a vehicle for the members\u2019 innovative views on art. Its four issues\u2014dated January to April 1850\u2014provided a venue for seven of Rossetti\u2019s poems: \u201cDreamland,\u201d \u201cAn End,\u201d \u201cSong\u201c (\u201cOh roses for the flush of youth\u201d ), \u201cA Pause of Thought,\u201d \u201cA Testimony,\u201d \u201cRepining,\u201d and \u201cSweet Death.\u201d These publications, which were anonymous in the first issue and pseudonymous thereafter, found an appreciative, though small, audience. The poems, and others composed at this time but not published until later, show that Rossetti had by then attained her mature poetic style, in which pain, loss, and resignation are expressed in diction and images that strike the reader as simple, perfect, and effortless.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nOne of the Pre-Raphaelite brethren, James Collinson, proposed marriage to Rossetti in 1848. She refused the offer, giving Collinson\u2019s recent conversion to Roman Catholicism as the reason. Collinson promptly returned to the Church of England, proposed a second time, and was accepted. Collinson has struck biographers as an unlikely suitor (anecdotes generally portray him as a lackluster sleepyhead), and opinion is mixed as to whether Rossetti was ever in love with him. The engagement ended in the spring of 1850 when Collinson reverted to Catholicism.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn 1850 Rossetti wrote\u00a0Maude: A Story for Girls\u00a0(1897), a novella that was not published until after her death. The title character\u2019s appearance and personality bear many similarities to accounts of the author, and this work, with its exploration of the tensions among the sometimes incompatible categories of female, poet, and Anglo-Catholic, is usually considered a semi-autobiographical portrait of the adolescent Rossetti. Fifteen-year-old Maude Foster is a poet whose \u201cbroken-hearted\u201d verse dwells on themes of suffering, world-weariness, resignation, and religious devotion. Some of Rossetti\u2019s important early poems, later published under the titles \u201cSong\u201d (\u201cShe sat and sang alway\u201d), \u201cThree Nuns,\u201d and \u201cSymbols,\u201d are included as Maude\u2019s productions, and a\u00a0bouts rim\u00e9s\u00a0contest also appears in the narrative. Rossetti returned to this mixing of genres\u2014prose punctuated with poetry\u2014in her devotional works\u00a0Called to Be Saints: The Minor Festivals Devotionally Studied\u00a0(1881),\u00a0Time Flies, and\u00a0The Face of the Deep: A Devotional Commentary on the Apocalypse\u00a0(1892). Religious issues play a central role in the story when Maude suffers a spiritual crisis, and Anglo-Catholic practices are described as she discusses with her cousins the heavily symbolic lectern cover they are embroidering, the question of a vocation as a nun, and the Eucharist. The main conflict in the narrative revolves around Maude\u2019s experience of the incompatibility of ladylike behavior and poetic achievement. Like the author, Maude is torn between pride in her work and moral qualms about that pride. The heroine\u2019s overactive conscience and endless self-recriminations provide considerable insight into Rossetti\u2019s own overscrupulous nature.\nThe family\u2019s financial crisis continued, and in 1851 the Rossettis moved from Charlotte Street to Camden Town, where Christina and her mother briefly ran a small day school. A second attempt at establishing a school, this time in Frome, lasted from March 1853 to February 1854, the only period in Rossetti\u2019s life when she made her home outside London. When she returned to the city, the family moved to Albany Street. At this point Christina and her mother permanently gave up teaching, and the family lived on William\u2019s and Mary\u2019s earnings and Frances\u2019s modest inherited income. Gabriele Rossetti died on 26 April 1854. For most of her adulthood Christina was financially supported primarily by William, a debt that she made provisions in her will to repay.\nThroughout her twenties Rossetti continued to write poetry and prose. Her Italian heritage is apparent in the Italian poems \u201cVersi\u201d and \u201cL\u2019Incognita\u201d and an unfinished epistolary novel, \u201cCorrispondenza [sic] Famigliare,\u201d which were published in a privately printed periodical,\u00a0The Bouquet from Marylebone Gardens\u00a0during 1851 and 1852. Attempts at publication in prestigious periodicals such as\u00a0Blackwood\u2019s\u00a0and\u00a0Fraser\u2019s\u00a0in 1854 failed. In a letter of 1 August 1854 to William Edmonstoune Aytoun of\u00a0Blackwood\u2019s\u00a0Rossetti declared: \u201cpoetry is with me, not a mechanism, but an impulse and a reality; and\u2026 I know my aims in writing to be pure, and directed to that which is true and right.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nRossetti has often been depicted as shrinking from worldly concerns, but, in fact, she did engage in humanitarian work. In 1854, during the Crimean War, she volunteered to join Florence Nightingale\u2019s nurses but was turned down. Her aunt Eliza Polidori did join Nightingale in Scutari, and Rossetti temporarily took over some of Polidori\u2019s district visiting, providing assistance to the sick and poor of the parish. In early 1859 Rossetti began volunteering at the St. Mary Magdalene Penitentiary in Highgate, a charitable institution for the reclamation of \u201cfallen\u201d women. As an \u201cassociate\u201d at Highgate, Rossetti was known as \u201cSister Christina\u201d and wore a habitlike black uniform with a veil. When she was on duty she resided at the penitentiary, probably for a fortnight at a time. By the summer of 1859 Rossetti was devoting a good deal of time to her work at Highgate, and its influence can be seen in her poems about illicit love, betrayal, and illegitimacy, such as \u201cCousin Kate,\u201d \u201c\u2018The Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children,\u2019\u201d and \u201cFrom Sunset to Star Rise,\u201d though poems composed before the period of her work at Highgate\u2014 \u201cAn Apple-Gathering,\u201d \u201cThe Convent Threshold,\u201d and \u201cMaude Clare\u201d for instance\u2014demonstrate her prior interest in the fallen woman. \u201cGoblin Market,\u201d with its theme of a fallen woman being saved by a \u201csister,\u201d can also be seen as informed by Rossetti\u2019s experiences at the St. Mary Magdalene Penitentiary. Her interest in this topic reflects the Victorian concern about prostitution as a social evil; other Pre-Raphaelite treatments of the subject include Dante Gabriel\u2019s poem \u201cJenny,\u201d begun in 1847 and revised in 1858-1859 and again in 1870; his unfinished painting\u00a0Found\u00a0(1854-1881); and William Holman Hunt\u2019s\u00a0The Awakened Conscience\u00a0(1853).\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn the 1850s a few of Rossetti\u2019s poems were published in anthologies; \u201cMaude Clare\u201d appeared in\u00a0Once a Week\u00a0(5 November 1859) and the short stories \u201cThe Lost Titian\u201d (The Crayon, 1856) and \u201cNick\u201d (National Magazine, October 1857). In 1861 she submitted poems to\u00a0Macmillan\u2019s Magazine, and Dante Gabriel sent \u201cGoblin Market\u201c to the art critic John Ruskin in the hope that he would recommend it to\u00a0William Makepeace Thackeray, editor of\u00a0The Cornhill.\u00a0Ruskin\u2019s criticism of Rossetti\u2019s masterpiece is infamous. In his letter of 24 January 1861 to Dante Gabriel, Ruskin singled out for criticism the original meter that is now so often praised: he acknowledged the poem\u2019s \u201cbeauty and power\u201d but asserted that it was unpublishable because it was \u201cso full of quaintnesses and offences,\u201d adding, \u201cIrregular measure\u2026 is the chief calamity of modern poetry\u2026 your sister should exercise herself in the severest commonplace of metre until she can write as the public like.\u201d Almost simultaneously, Rossetti\u2019s poem \u201cUp-hill\u201d was accepted enthusiastically for\u00a0Macmillan\u2019s\u00a0(February 1861), and Alexander Macmillan expressed an interest in seeing more of her work. During 1861\u00a0Macmillan\u2019s\u00a0published two more of Rossetti\u2019s poems: \u201cA Birthday\u201c (April 1861) and \u201cAn Apple-Gathering\u201d (August 1861). In June of that year Rossetti took a short vacation in France.\u201d\nIn 1862 the Macmillan firm brought out Rossetti\u2019s first commercially published volume of poetry,\u00a0Goblin Market and Other Poems.\u00a0Although some of the poems had been published in\u00a0Macmillan\u2019s, Once a Week, and\u00a0The Germ, and others were included in the manuscript for\u00a0Maude, most were taken from the notebooks in which Rossetti had been writing since the private printing of\u00a0Verses\u00a0in 1847. Comparisons of the manuscript and printed versions of the poems show that most were not substantially revised. Usually the earliest extant version of a given poem is the fair copy transcribed into the notebook; if Rossetti reworked it in the act of composition, such drafts no longer exist. She often changed a word or two in preparation for publication; where major revisions occurred, they took the form of the deletion of whole stanzas, sometimes reducing a poem by more than half its original length: such is the case with \u201cMaude Clare,\u201d \u201cEcho,\u201d and \u201cBitter for Sweet.\u201d This tendency to reduce is part of the economy of expression that is a Rossetti trademark, and the result is poetry in which meaning is suggestive rather than explicit. Looking back on her career, Rossetti wrote in an 1888 letter to an unknown clergyman that \u201cPerhaps the nearest approach to a method I can lay claim to was a distinct aim at conciseness; after a while I received a hint from my sister that my love of conciseness tended to make my writing obscure, and I then endeavoured to avoid obscurity as well as diffuseness. In poetics, my elder brother was my acute and most helpful critic.\u201d Throughout her career Dante Gabriel not only critiqued her work but also negotiated with publishers, assisted with book design, corrected proofs, and provided illustrations for her publications. As\u00a0Goblin Market and Other Poems\u00a0was being prepared for the press, he advised on the selection of poems, suggested dividing them into secular and devotional sections, and proposed new titles for some\u2014including the title poem, which was originally called \u201cA Peep at the Goblins.\u201d He also provided frontispiece and title-page designs drawn from that poem.\r\n\u00a0\nGoblin Market and Other Poems\u00a0was a critical success, with favorable notices in many periodicals, including\u00a0The London Review\u00a0(12 April 1862),\u00a0The Spectator\u00a0(12 April 1862),\u00a0The Athenaeum\u00a0(26 April 1862),\u00a0The Saturday Review\u00a0(24 May 1862),\u00a0The Eclectic Review\u00a0(June 1862), and\u00a0The British Quarterly Review\u00a0(July 1862). Critics welcomed a fresh and original poetic voice:\u00a0The Eclectic Review\u00a0hailed \u201ca true and most genuine poet,\u201d while\u00a0The Athenaeum\u00a0remarked that \u201cTo read these poems after the laboured and skilful but not original verse which has been issued of late, is like passing from a picture gallery, with its well-feigned semblances of nature, to the real nature out-of-doors which greets us with the waving grass and the pleasant shock of the breeze.\u201d \u201cGoblin Market,\u201d \u201cUp-hill,\u201d \u201cAn Apple-Gathering,\u201d and \u201cAdvent\u201d were frequently singled out for praise.\r\n\u00a0\r\nToday \u201cGoblin Market\u201c remains Rossetti\u2019s most discussed poem. Critics have dismissed her protest that she intended no allegorical meaning and have interpreted in various ways her fairy tale of two sisters\u2019 responses to the temptation of goblin fruit. Lizzie rejects the luscious fruit as \u201cevil,\u201d but Laura purchases it with a lock of her hair and indulges. Afterward she wastes away, pining for more fruit. The goblins refuse to allow Lizzie to purchase fruit to save her sister, try to persuade her to eat with them, then attempt to force the fruit into her mouth. Lizzie escapes and runs home to Laura, who is cured by tasting the juices smeared on her sister\u2019s face. The poem ends years later with Laura telling the story to the sisters\u2019 offspring; she concludes by saying:\u00a0\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For there is no friend like a sister\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In calm or stormy weather;\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 To cheer one on the tedious way,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 To fetch one if one goes astray,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 To lift one if one totters down,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 To strengthen whilst one stands.\n\r\nThe suggestiveness of the narrative runs in many directions, and this multivalency is perhaps the most striking quality of the poem. It can be read as a straightforward moral allegory of temptation, indulgence, sacrifice, and redemption. It has also been interpreted as a specifically Christian allegory, with a reenactment of the temptation in the Garden of Eden and a Christ-like offer of redemption through sacrifice\u2014a reading that is encouraged by the Eucharistic diction of Lizzie\u2019s greeting, \u201c\u2018Eat me, drink me, love me; / Laura, make much of me.\u2019\u201c Significantly, this Christ is a female one, and feminist readings of \u201cGoblin Market\u201c have often focused on its positive image of sisterhood. Psychoanalytic interpretations have regarded the sisters as two aspects of one psyche and have emphasized the sexuality of the poem, noting both its orality and its lesbian dynamics. Marxist critics have pointed to the poem\u2019s separation of the domestic and commercial spheres and to Lizzie and Laura\u2019s attempts to do business in a marketplace designed to make women into goods to be exchanged rather than agents in their own right. Critics of many orientations have noted that the sensuality of the fruit, its prohibition to maidens, and its association with nuptial pleasures suggest that Laura\u2019s transgression is a sexual one. In this interpretation, Lizzie\u2019s climactic redemption of Laura can be seen as a critique of the Victorian cultural understanding of the fallen woman, for here she is not forever lost but is saved by a sister\u2019s intervention.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn \u201cGoblin Market\u201c the sisters are endangered by male goblins, and Laura is redeemed through the strength of sisterhood; elsewhere in\u00a0Goblin Market and Other Poems, however, the danger that men pose as sexual predators is not offset by female solidarity. Throughout the volume Rossetti presents a bleak appraisal of gender relations. The flimsiness and inconstancy of romantic love is a recurring theme, as is the treachery of sister against sister in a ruthlessly competitive marriage market. In \u201cCousin Kate\u201d the unnamed speaker has been seduced by a nobleman and has borne him a son; now she finds herself a discarded \u201cplaything,\u201d supplanted by her fair and pure cousin Kate, whom the lord has taken not as a mistress but as his wife. The women in this ballad do not live up to the code of sisterly conduct with which \u201cGoblin Market\u201d concludes. Kate usurps her cousin\u2019s position and ensures the latter\u2019s status as \u201can outcast thing\u201d; the speaker accuses Kate of betrayal of female loyalty, but her own moral integrity comes under question in the final stanza when she gloats that while she has borne her former lover a son, her cousin remains barren.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAdversarial women are also depicted in \u201cNoble Sisters,\u201d a deftly ambiguous dialogue in which the reader must evaluate the reliability of two speakers with opposed moral viewpoints. Similarly, in \u201cSister Maude\u201d the reader is asked to consider whose sin is greater: the woman who has taken a lover or her sister, who exposes the illicit union. Other pieces in\u00a0Goblin Market and Other Poems\u00a0that depict the failure or betrayal of human (as opposed to divine) love and explore women\u2019s sexual and economic vulnerability include \u201cAt Home,\u201d \u201cA Triad,\u201d \u201cAfter Death,\u201d \u201cThe Hour and the Ghost,\u201d \u201cAn Apple-Gathering,\u201d \u201cMaude Clare,\u201d and \u201cThe Convent Threshold.\u201d These works serve to reinforce the devotional poems\u2019 theme of looking to the next life for reward, happiness, and fulfillment. Indeed, with the exception of \u201cA Birthday\u201c and its ecstatic declaration that \u201cthe birthday of my life / Is come, my love is come to me,\u201d little evidence exists anywhere in the volume that human love is satisfied or satisfying.\nThe theme of the inconstancy and insufficiency of any love except God\u2019s pervades the devotional section. Deferral of satisfaction is constantly advocated, as in \u201cThe Convent Threshold,\u201d in which the speaker urges her lover to join her in repentance for their \u201cpleasant sin.\u201d The speaker\u2019s motives are complex, however, for her purpose seems to be the prospect of resuming their \u201cold familiar love\u201d in heaven. Consistently in Rossetti\u2019s poetry the concerns of this world are regarded as inconsequential in comparison to the promise of salvation. Throughout her canon, but especially in the devotional poems, biblical image and idiom merge with Rossetti\u2019s own voice. Revelation and Ecclesiastes are favorite sources, and the \u201cvanity of vanity\u201d refrain is a recurring motif.\nOther pieces reveal some of Rossetti\u2019s poetical range: the political subject matter of \u201cIn the Round Tower at Jhansi, June 8, 1857\u201d; the social critique of \u201cA Triad\u201d; the banter of \u201cNo, Thank You, John\u201d ; the whimsical, teasing mystery of \u201cWinter: My Secret\u201d ; and the darker, suggestive mystery of poems with enigmatic and unnamed significances, such as \u201cMy Dream,\u201d \u201cMay,\u201d and \u201cA Pause of Thought.\u201d In a style that has affinities with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood but that she made distinctively her own, Rossetti\u2019s precisely drawn natural details assume the weight of suggestive symbolism. For example, in \u201cAn Apple-Gathering,\u201d in which the speaker finds herself abandoned by Willie and replaced by \u201cPlump Gertrude,\u201d the speaker\u2019s ill-considered plucking of apple blossoms and the concomitant forfeit of a rich harvest resonates on many levels. Similarly, \u201cUp-hill\u201d and \u201cSymbols\u201d effortlessly evoke profound meaning from the simplest details: an uphill journey toward a place of rest, a flower that blooms and fades, and eggs that fail to hatch. Many poems in\u00a0Goblin Market and Other Poems\u00a0continue the morbid strain that was so prominent in\u00a0Verses. \u201cDream-land,\u201d \u201cAt Home,\u201d \u201cRemember,\u201d \u201cAfter Death,\u201d \u201cAn End,\u201d \u201cSong\u201c (\u201cOh roses for the flush of youth\u201d), \u201cEcho,\u201d \u201cA Peal of Bells,\u201d \u201cMay,\u201d \u201cA Pause of Thought,\u201d \u201cShut Out,\u201d \u201cSong\u201d (\u201cWhen I am dead, my dearest\u201c), \u201cDead Before Death,\u201d \u201cBitter for Sweet,\u201d and \u201cRest\u201d strike the signature Rossetti notes of longing, loss, resignation, and death. In the final two poems in the volume, \u201cOld and New Year Ditties\u201d and \u201cAmen,\u201d this loss is met with the promise of fulfillment, expressed in the biblical figures of marriage and the fruitful garden. Critics have noted that Rossetti\u2019s volumes are carefully arranged into meaningful sequences, and\u00a0Goblin Market and Other Poems\u00a0includes many examples of significant continuities among the poems and correlations between the nondevotional and devotional sections.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDuring the early 1860s Rossetti was often in contact with female artists\u2014including the members of the Portfolio Society, an informal group organized by Barbara Bodichon\u2014and female poets, such as\u00a0Jean Ingelow\u00a0and Dora Greenwell. She published poems in the feminist periodicals\u00a0The English Woman\u2019s Journal\u00a0and\u00a0Victoria Magazine\u00a0and in various anthologies, in addition to making regular appearances in\u00a0Macmillan\u2019s.\u00a0A respiratory complaint led her to spend the winter of 1864-1865 in Hastings, where she began work on her next poetry volume,\u00a0The Prince\u2019s Progress and Other Poems\u00a0(1866).\nThat Dante Gabriel played a large role in the preparation of the book is evident from the almost daily correspondence between brother and sister, which provides valuable insight into Rossetti\u2019s methods and includes some spirited rebuttals to Dante Gabriel\u2019s criticisms. Rossetti\u2019s letters make it clear that she tried to write to order for the book, which was not her preferred method of composition. In later years she acknowledged in a 20 May 1885 letter to W. Garrett Horder that \u201cJust because poetry\u00a0is\u00a0a gift\u2026 I am not surprised to find myself unable to summon it at will and use it according to my choice.\u201d According to William Michael Rossetti in\u00a0Rossetti Papers 1862 to 1870\u00a0(1903), the title poem originated in a suggestion from Dante Gabriel that she \u201cturn a brief dirge-song\u2026 into that longish narrative, as\u00a0pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance\u00a0for a new volume.\u201d The Prince\u2019s sojourn with the Alchemist gave Rossetti some difficulties, as she explained in a 16 January 1865 letter to Dante Gabriel: \u201cthe\u00a0Alchemist\u00a0makes himself scarce, and I must bide his time.\u201d Rossetti was not given to rewriting, and once written, the Alchemist remained unchanged: \u201cHe\u2019s not precisely the Alchemist I prefigured, but thus he came,\u201d she wrote to Dante Gabriel on 30 January, \u201c& thus he must stay: you know my system of work.\u201d\nIn a letter of 10 February she rejected Dante Gabriel\u2019s suggestion that she try to write an episode in which the Prince would fight in a tournament, pleading inability, lack of inspiration, and the formidable precedent of Tennyson\u2019s two tournaments in\u00a0Idylls of the King\u00a0(1859). Publication of the volume was delayed for a year, while Rossetti waited for Dante Gabriel\u2019s promised illustrations. In May 1865 she, William, and their mother traveled in France, Switzerland, and Italy. That same year she met\u00a0Robert Browning, who visited her in London and told her about his work in progress,\u00a0The Ring and the Book\u00a0(1868-1869).\r\n\u00a0\nThe Prince\u2019s Progress and Other Poems\u00a0was met with mildly favorable reviews. The critic for\u00a0The Saturday Review\u00a0(23 June 1866) thought that the title poem lacked \u201csubtle suggestion,\u201d while the reviewer for\u00a0The Reader\u00a0(30 June 1866) pronounced it \u201ctoo long to suit Christina Rossetti\u2019s genius for short lyrical thoughts.\u201d In a letter of 6 March 1865 to Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Christina Rossetti agreed that \u201cThe Prince\u2019s Progress\u201d lacked \u201cthe special felicity (!) of my\u00a0Goblins.\u201d \u201cThe Prince\u2019s Progress\u201d has never attracted the same intensity of critical scrutiny as \u201cGoblin Market\u201c and typically suffers in comparisons with that masterpiece. As the reviewer for the 23 June 1866 issue of\u00a0The Athenaeum\u00a0observed, the two title poems are similar in that both are allegories of temptation; in \u201cGoblin Market,\u201d however, temptation is overcome, while in \u201cThe Prince\u2019s Progress\u201d it wins out. The Prince procrastinates at great length before setting out to claim his waiting bride. He does not, however, remain true to his purpose, and on his journey he is sidetracked and delayed first by a milkmaid, then by an alchemist, and finally by a circle of ministering females who save him from drowning. When he arrives at his bride\u2019s palace, she is dead. The element of spiritual allegory is evident in \u201cThe Prince\u2019s Progress\u201d; even the title echoes Bunyan\u2019s allegorical\u00a0The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, a literary influence from Rossetti\u2019s earliest childhood. The pilgrimage of Bunyan\u2019s Christian through an emblematic landscape is a topos that Rossetti must have absorbed into her own consciousness, for her poems often depict journeys in which topographical details, such as paths that go uphill or downhill, are morally and spiritually significant. For instance, the easy downhill path of \u201cAmor Mundi\u201c is clearly the way to damnation, while the upward climbs of \u201cUp-hill\u201d and \u201cThe Convent Threshold\u201d are made by those who aspire to salvation.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhile biblical language and image are pervasive in \u201cThe Prince\u2019s Progress,\u201d the poem also has a fairy-tale quality; the unhappy ending, however, serves to critique the gender roles typical of that genre. Relegated to a passive role, the waiting bride dies because of the Prince\u2019s failure to complete his quest in a timely fashion; her fate underlines the dangerous predicament of women waiting to be rescued. Elsewhere in\u00a0The Prince\u2019s Progress and Other Poems, however, women engage in lives of active service, deferring satisfaction in this life in favor of the reward promised in the next. In \u201cA Portrait\u201d the sacrifice of \u201cyouth,\u201d \u201chope and joy and pleasant ways\u201d for the sake of serving the \u201cpoor and stricken\u201d earns the heroine union with the Bridegroom Christ in Paradise. In \u201cA Royal Princess,\u201d which originally appeared in\u00a0Poems: An Offering to Lancashire\u00a0(1863), an anthology published in support of Lancashire textile workers, the title figure realizes that her wealth and privilege are based on the enslavement of others: \u201cOnce it came into my heart and whelmed me like a flood, / That these too are men and women, human flesh and blood.\u201d The poem ends with the princess\u2019s rebellion against the insulation from social concerns to which she has been subject because of her class and gender; echoing the biblical Esther, she risks all in offering herself and her wealth to an angry, hungry mob.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDante Gabriel was highly critical of a long poem that his sister included in\u00a0The Prince\u2019s Progress and Other Poems, \u201c\u2018The Iniquity of the Fathers Upon the Children.\u2019\u201c Responding in a letter of 13 March 1865, Rossetti vigorously defended the woman poet\u2019s right to explore indelicate issues such as illegitimacy: \u201cwhilst I endorse your opinion of the unavoidable and indeed much-to-be-desired unreality of women\u2019s work on many social matters, I yet incline to include within female range such an attempt as this: where the certainly possible circumstances are merely indicated as it were in skeleton, where the subordinate characters perform (and no more) their accessory parts, where the field is occupied by a single female figure whose internal portrait is set forth in her own words\u2026 and whilst it may truly be urged that unless white could be black and Heaven Hell my experience (thank God) precludes me from hers, I yet don\u2019t see why \u2018the Poet mind\u2019 should be less able to construct her from its own inner consciousness than a hundred other unknown quantities.\u201d The speaker of \u201c\u2018The Iniquity of the Fathers Upon the Children\u2019\u201d lives as a servant in the household of her mother, who so fears social condemnation that she does not acknowledge her illegitimate daughter. Mother and daughter suffer the lifelong consequences of illegitimacy, while the seducer father is absent from the poem and, presumably, free of social stigma. The poem shows the injustice of conventional morality in a patriarchal society and offers the equality of the grave as the only solution.\r\n\u00a0\r\nTypically, Rossetti\u2019s poems evince a concern with individual salvation rather than social reform. Writing to Dante Gabriel in April 1870, she declared, \u201cIt is not in me, and therefore it will never come out of me, to turn to politics or philanthropy with Mrs Browning: such many-sidedness I leave to a greater than I, and having said my say may well sit silent.\u201d\u00a0The Prince\u2019s Progress and Other Poems\u00a0lays great emphasis on the transitoriness of this life, a recurring theme in the Rossetti canon. The lesson to be learned from poems such as \u201cOn the Wing,\u201d \u201cBeauty is Vain,\u201d \u201cThe Bourne,\u201d \u201cVanity of Vanities,\u201d \u201cGrown and Flown,\u201d \u201cA Farm Walk,\u201d and \u201cGone for Ever\u201d is that all earthly things are unreliable, illusory, and passing. Implicitly contrasted with the fleeting quality of this life is the permanence of God and the heavenly reward. With its comparison of human and divine love, \u201cTwice\u201d is a characteristic statement of this theme. The speaker first offers her heart to her lover, who, with a \u201cfriendly smile\u201d and \u201ccritical eye,\u201d sets it aside as \u201cunripe.\u201d The speaker then offers the broken heart to God, with the entreaty \u201cRefine with fire its gold, / Purge Thou its dross away.\u201d The failure of human love is a keynote in the volume, beginning with the title poem and appearing again in \u201cJessie Cameron,\u201d \u201cThe Poor Ghost,\u201d \u201cSongs in a Cornfield,\u201d \u201cOne Day,\u201d \u201cA Bird\u2019s-Eye View,\u201d \u201cLight Love,\u201d \u201cOn the Wing,\u201d \u201cMaggie a Lady,\u201d \u201cThe Ghost\u2019s Petition,\u201d \u201cGrown and Flown,\u201d and \u201c\u2018The Iniquity of the Fathers Upon the Children.\u2019\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn the autumn of 1866 Rossetti declined an offer of marriage from Charles Bagot Cayley. Cayley had begun studying Italian with her father in 1847, sharing the Rossettis\u2019 enthusiasm for Dante and endearing himself to them with his attentive visits during their father\u2019s final illness. A hesitant romance probably began to develop between Rossetti and the awkward, absentminded scholar around 1862. Rossetti\u2019s reasons for rejecting his proposal can only be surmised. In a note in his edition of\u00a0The Family Letters of Christina Georgina Rossetti\u00a0(1908) William says that she turned Cayley down \u201con grounds of religious faith.\u201d At the time, William thought that there might be financial obstacles to the union and offered the couple a place in his household; his sister responded on 11 September 1866: \u201cAs to money I might be selfish enough to wish that were the only bar, but you see from my point of view it is not.\u2014 Now I am at least unselfish enough altogether to deprecate seeing C.B.C. continually (with nothing but mere feeling to offer) to his hamper & discomfort: but, if he\u00a0likes\u00a0to see me, God knows I like to see him, & any kindness you will show him will only be additional kindness loaded on me.\u201d Much is unknown about the relationship between Cayley and Rossetti. In his memoir William notes that \u201cChristina was extremely reticent in all matters in which her affections were deeply engaged\u201d and that \u201cit would have been both indelicate and futile to press her with inquiries, and of several details in the second case [Rossetti\u2019s relationship with Cayley]\u2014 though important to a close understanding of it\u2014I never was cognizant.\u201d Cayley and Rossetti remained close until his death in 1883, and Rossetti served as his literary executor. She declined to have a large packet of her letters to him returned to her, asking that they be destroyed. After Rossetti\u2019s death, William found in her desk a series of twenty-one highly personal poems written in Italian. Composed between 1862 and 1868 and titled \u201cIl Rosseggiar dell\u2019Oriente\u201d (The Reddening Dawn), the sequence is generally understood to be addressed to Cayley; it was first published in Rossetti\u2019s\u00a0New Poems, Hitherto Unpublished or Uncollected\u00a0(1896).\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn 1867 Rossetti published in\u00a0The Churchman\u2019s Shilling Magazine\u00a0three religious and moralistic stories: \u201cThe Waves of this Troublesome World: A Tale of Hastings Ten Years Ago\u201d (April and May 1867), \u201cSome Pros and Cons about Pews\u201d (July 1867), and \u201cA Safe Investment\u201d (November 1867); all were republished in\u00a0Commonplace and Other Short Stories\u00a0(1870). For this volume Rossetti was persuaded by Dante Gabriel to defect from Macmillan to his publisher, F. S. Ellis.\u00a0Commonplace and Other Short Stories\u00a0was a commercial failure, though reviewers singled out \u201cThe Lost Titian\u201d and the title story, with its Jane Austen-like social comment, for praise.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFrom 1870 to 1872 Rossetti was dangerously ill, at times apparently near death, with a condition characterized by fever, exhaustion, heart palpitations, stifling sensations, occasional loss of consciousness, violent headaches, palsied hands, and swelling in the neck that made swallowing difficult. Her hair fell out, her skin became discolored, her eyes began to protrude, and her voice changed. After some months her doctors diagnosed a rare thyroid condition, exophthalmic bronchocele, more commonly known as Graves\u2019 disease. Although Rossetti recovered, the threat of a relapse always remained. Moreover, the crisis left her appearance permanently altered and her heart weakened.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe reception of Rossetti\u2019s collection of stories left Ellis disinclined to publish her next work, a collection of poems for children.\u00a0Sing-Song: A Nursery Rhyme Book\u00a0was published by Routledge in 1872 and was favorably received; the public was particularly pleased by the illustrations by Arthur Hughes. Some of the poems are primarily edifying, promoting, for instance, patience or good manners; others are memory aids for learning about numbers, time, money, months, and colors. The sound and meter of these little rhymes delight the ear, and Rossetti\u2019s wit is evident in the playfulness of lines such as \u201cA hill has no leg, but has a foot; / A wine-glass a stem, but not a root.\u201d Again nature presents an emblematic aspect, and the phenomena of wind, rain, growth, and death and the alternation of night and day suggest a larger order. Most of the poems are evocative of the security of an ideal childhood, but others modulate into more-serious subject matter in simple and moving explorations of death and loss. Some critics have questioned the appropriateness of these darker themes for the intended audience.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDante Gabriel had been prone to insomnia for some time and had become dependent on alcohol and chloral in his attempts to sleep. By June 1872 his paranoid belief that there was a conspiracy led by Robert Buchanan, author of \u201cThe Fleshly School of Poetry\u201d (1871), to ruin his reputation had become clearly delusional, and he was raving and hearing voices. William concluded that his brother was insane and put him under the care of Dante Gabriel\u2019s friend Dr. Thomas Gordon Hake, in whose home he took a large dose of laudanum in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. Cared for by friends, Dante Gabriel made a partial recovery, though he continued his use of alcohol and chloral.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn 1873 Maria Rossetti joined the All Saints\u2019 Sisterhood. In March 1874 William married Lucy Brown, daughter of the painter Ford Madox Brown. The combined household of the newly married couple and William\u2019s mother, sister, and aunts Charlotte and Eliza Polidori was not a harmonious one.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFollowing her recovery from Graves\u2019 disease Rossetti published the first of her six volumes of devotional prose,\u00a0Annus Domini: A Prayer for Each Day of the Year, Founded on a Text of Holy Scripture\u00a0(1874). In these devotional writings readers can find explicit statements of themes treated in the poetry of previous decades, and in many instances Rossetti discusses natural and biblical images, virtually glossing favorite poetic symbols. More generally, the devotional prose provides insight into Rossetti\u2019s symbolic method, for she repeatedly indicates that this world is to be read as \u201ctypical,\u201d \u201csuggestive,\u201d \u201cemblematical,\u201d and \u201csymbolical.\u201d\u00a0Annus Domini\u00a0consists of 366 meditations, each of which includes a passage from scripture followed by a collect beginning with an invocation to Christ. The texts are arranged in the order of their appearance in the Bible, and prayers throughout are intensely Christ-centered; even Old Testament passages prompt an address to Christ.\r\n\u00a0\r\nRossetti returned to Macmillan for the publication of\u00a0Speaking Likenesses\u00a0in 1874. The book consists of three tales framed by the dialogue among a storytelling aunt and her nieces. Many readers have noted the sexual implications of the monstrous children in the first tale\u2014boys bristling with hooks, quills, and angles; girls exuding sticky and slimy fluids\u2014and that the predatory games they play amount to a figurative rape. While terror predominates in the first tale, in the second a young child\u2019s desire to have a gypsy tea ends in frustration and despair as she fails to master the tasks of lighting a fire and boiling a kettle. The final tale, in which danger and temptation are overcome, rounds out the volume with a happy ending. The influence of\u00a0Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u00a0(1865) and\u00a0Through the Looking-Glass\u00a0(1872) is evident, and Rossetti herself described the work to Dante Gabriel in a letter of 4 May 1874 as \u201ca Christmas trifle, would-be in the\u00a0Alice\u00a0style, with an eye to the market.\u201d The title, Rossetti explained to Macmillan on 27 July 1874, refers to the way the heroines \u201cperpetually encounter \u2018speaking (literally\u00a0speaking) likenesses\u2019 or embodiments or caricatures of themselves or their faults.\u201d Ruskin lamented in a 21 January 1875 letter to the publisher Ellis that\u00a0Speaking Likenesses\u00a0was the worst of the children\u2019s books from the previous Christmas season: \u201cHow could she or Arthur Hughes sink so low after their pretty nursery rhymes?\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn 1874 Macmillan offered to bring out a new edition of Rossetti\u2019s complete poems and inquired after new compositions. On 4 February Rossetti responded, \u201cthe possibility of your thinking proper some day to reprint my two volumes, is really gratifying to me as you may suppose; but as to the additional matter, I fear there will be little indeed to offer you. The fire has died out, it seems; and I know of no bellows potent to revive dead coals. I wish I did.\u201d In 1875 the idea of a new edition of\u00a0Goblin Market and Other Poems\u00a0and\u00a0Prince\u2019s Progress and Other Poems\u00a0was taken up again. In a 30 January letter to Macmillan, Rossetti said that she would try to gather new pieces as well as \u201cwaifs and strays,\u201d poems that had appeared in magazines but had not been published in her collections. In\u00a0Goblin Market, The Prince\u2019s Progress and Other Poems\u00a0(1875) pieces from the previous volumes and thirty-seven new ones are intermingled into a single poetic sequence. Rossetti omitted some poems from the new collection, most notably \u201cA Triad,\u201d \u201cCousin Kate,\u201d and \u201cSister Maude,\u201d all of which explore sexual issues. Evidently she did not work under her brother\u2019s guidance in preparing the volume, for Dante Gabriel\u2019s 3 December 1875 letter addressed the book as a fait accompli. While he conceded that \u201cA Royal Princess\u201d is \u201ctoo good to omit,\u201d he thought it bore the taint of \u201cmodern vicious style,\u201d a kind of \u201cfalsetto muscularity\u201d in part traceable to Elizabeth Barrett Browning\u2019s influence. He also perceived this taint in \u201cNo, Thank You, John\u201d and, more prominently, in \u201cThe Lowest Room,\u201d and he lectured his sister that \u201ceverything in which this tone appears is utterly foreign to your primary impulses\u201d and warned that she should \u201crigidly keep guard\u201d against it. Although \u201cThe Lowest Room\u201d had been published in\u00a0Macmillan\u2019s Magazine\u00a0in March 1864, Dante Gabriel had prevailed in keeping it out of\u00a0The Prince\u2019s Progress and Other Poems.\u00a0In this extended dialogue between two sisters the younger asks, \u201cWhy should not you, why should not I / Attain heroic strength?\u201d\u2014a question at the heart of the poem\u2019s engagement with Homeric epic and with women\u2019s search for fulfilment in the modern Christian age. The tensions between the sisters, between aspiration and opportunity, and between ambition and resignation are highly charged and never fully resolved. One speaker\u2019s hard-won submission\u2014\u201dNot to be first: how hard to learn / That lifelong lesson of the past; / Line graven on line and stroke on stroke; / But, thank God, learned at last\u201d\u2014and acceptance of the \u201clowest place\u201d are undermined in the final stanza by her anticipation of an inversion of this hierarchy in the heavenly order, where \u201cmany last be first.\u201d This inversion of earthly and heavenly status appears again in \u201cThe Lowest Place,\u201d the final poem in the collection. The richness of this well-known lyric comes largely from its curious blend of timidity and temerity, for self-abnegation promises to be rewarded with exaltation, and thus the speaker\u2019s humble request is also an audacious one.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn 1876 Rossetti, her mother, and her aunts left William\u2019s Euston Square home and moved to Torrington Square, Bloomsbury. In November, Maria died of cancer; Christina\u2019s reminiscence in\u00a0Time Flies\u00a0portrays her death as an example of spiritual confidence and anticipation of salvation. Biographers have often commented on its contrast to Christina\u2019s deathbed anguish.\r\n\u00a0\r\nRossetti\u2019s next book,\u00a0Seek and Find: A Double Series of Short Studies on the Benedicite\u00a0(1879), was published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (S.P.C.K.), which published the rest of her devotional prose works as well as\u00a0Verses\u00a0(1893), her collection of devotional poems.\u00a0Seek and Find\u00a0consists of two series of studies on the Benedicite, a long poem praising a catalogue of God\u2019s works that is included in the Book of Common Prayer as an apocryphal addition to the Book of Daniel. The first series of studies in\u00a0Seek and Find, \u201cCreation,\u201d contemplates each item in the Benedicite\u2014heavens, waters, the sun, birds, other animals, and human beings\u2014in the context of its creation by providing and discussing scriptural passages that are generally, though not exclusively, from the Old Testament. The second series, \u201cRedemption,\u201d considers the same items in relation to Christ and cites mainly New Testament passages.\r\n\u00a0\r\nLike many of Rossetti\u2019s poems, her devotional works are double-edged swords of submission and assertion: while they urge obedience to divine will, they also encroach into the traditionally male territories of theological study, biblical exegesis, and spiritual guidance. Similarly, Rossetti\u2019s views on gender issues combine the conservative with the radical. Citing biblical teaching on woman\u2019s subordination to man, Rossetti had written to the poet Augusta Webster in 1878 that because she believed that \u201cthe highest functions are not in this world open to both sexes,\u201d she could not sign a petition for women\u2019s suffrage. She went on, however, to suggest that suffrage is not enough to protect women\u2019s interests and that female representation in Parliament would be more consistent with the aims of the women\u2019s movement. She also argued for the heroic possibilities of maternal love and its potential to sweep away \u201cthe barrier of sex.\u201d It is not uncommon to find such traces of subversiveness in Rossetti\u2019s apparently conservative statements on gender roles. An extended discussion of the subject in\u00a0Seek and Find\u00a0begins with a quite traditional discussion of woman as a lesser light\u2014a moon to man\u2019s sun. But Rossetti then moves from a statement about the feminine lot being one of obedience to a paragraph-long comparison between the feminine role and the position that Christ voluntarily assumed on earth, and she ends with a leveling of gender hierarchies: \u201cone final consolation yet remains to careful and troubled hearts: in Christ there is neither male nor female, for we are all one (Gal.iii.28).\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nBiographers have painted an overly simplistic portrait of the middle-aged Rossetti as narrowly conservative, reclusive, and overly pious. Her dedication to Anglo-Catholicism certainly intensified, and it took some odd forms, such as her habit of stooping to pick up stray pieces of paper on the street lest they have the Lord\u2019s name printed on them. From 1876, when she moved to Torrington Square, until her final illness Rossetti worshiped at Christ Church, Woburn Square. Mackenzie Bell relates the impression that she made on a fellow member of the congregation: \u201cA friend informs me that towards the close of her life Christina always sat in the very front pew in church. She remained until the very last before leaving the building, and it was evident from her demeanour that even then she strove to avoid ordinary conversation, evidently feeling that it would disturb her mood of mind.\u201d Never comfortable socially, by this time she was reluctant to venture beyond her intimate circle of family and friends: she was aware that she possessed a degree of fame, and she felt self-conscious in conversations that bore the aspect of an interview. She also dreaded receiving unsolicited poems from aspiring writers, because she was torn between kindness and honesty regarding the merit of the work. Though increasingly reclusive, however, Rossetti was more politically outspoken in these later years. Critical of slavery, imperialism, and military aggression, she was most passionately committed to the antivivisection movement, at one point breaking with the S.P.C.K. over its publication of a work condoning animal experimentation. She also petitioned for legislation to protect children from prostitution and sexual exploitation by raising the age of consent.\r\n\u00a0\r\nRossetti\u2019s next work,\u00a0Called to Be Saints: The Minor Festivals Devotionally Studied, published in 1881, had been completed by 1876; Macmillan had turned it down under its previous title, \u201cYoung Plants and Polished Corners.\u201d A devotional accompaniment for the red-letter saints\u2019 days,\u00a0Called to Be Saints\u00a0provides for each day an account of the saint\u2019s life, a prayer, an intricate \u201cmemorial\u201d in two columns linking the saint\u2019s life with biblical texts, and descriptions of the emblem, precious stone, and flower associated with the saint and discussions of their appropriateness. Although biographers have tended to emphasize the narrowing of Rossetti\u2019s interests in her later life in that she then wrote in an exclusively devotional vein, one might note that she dealt with a wide array of topics within this framework. In\u00a0Called to Be Saints\u00a0she ranges from the biblical and hagiographical to the botanical and petrographical.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAs her poetic creativity decreased, Rossetti cultivated a modest scholarly impulse. Earlier instances of her scholarly writing include her entries on Italian writers and other celebrities in the\u00a0Imperial Dictionary of Universal Biography\u00a0(1857-1863); in her article on Petrarch she claims to be a descendant of Laura. In 1867 she had published the first of two articles on Dante, a commendatory piece written in support of Cayley\u2019s terza rima translation of\u00a0The Divine Comedy\u00a0(1851-1855). After attending lectures on\u00a0The Divine Comedy\u00a0at University College, London, from 1878 to 1880 she wrote a more ambitious article, \u201cDante: The Poet Illustrated out of the Poem\u201d (1884). In 1882 she considered undertaking literary biographies of Adelaide Proctor and Elizabeth Barrett Browning; and she took a commission and began to research a life of Ann Radcliffe, but a lack of materials prevented her from completing it. She agreed to trace allusions to Dante, Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio for Alexander Balloch Grosart\u2019s scholarly edition of\u00a0The Faerie Queene\u00a0in\u00a0The Complete Works in Verse and Prose of\u00a0Edmund Spenser\u00a0(1882-1884), a project from which she withdrew because of ill health. She spent many afternoons at the British Museum and was a tireless reader of periodicals, including\u00a0The Athenaeum,\u00a0Macmillan\u2019s Magazine,\u00a0The Saturday Review,\u00a0Blackwood\u2019s, and\u00a0The Edinburgh Review.\r\n\u00a0\r\nRossetti\u2019s research on Petrarch and Dante informs one of the most important poems of her maturity, \u201cMonna Innominata,\u201d which appeared in her third commercially published poetry collection,\u00a0A Pageant and Other Poems\u00a0(1880). A sequence of fourteen sonnets\u2014 thus subtitled \u201cA Sonnet of Sonnets\u201d\u2014\u201dMonna Innominata\u201d draws attention to its links to the medieval amatory tradition both in its prose preface and in the epigraphs from Dante and Petrarch that introduce each sonnet. In his notes in\u00a0The Poetical Works of Christina Georgina Rossetti\u00a0William Michael Rossetti attested that the introductory prose note was \u201ca blind interposed to draw off attention from the writer in her proper person\u201d and that the sonnet sequence was an \u201cintensely personal\u201d utterance. The subject matter of love deeply felt, reciprocated, and yet unfulfilled is generally taken to refer to Rossetti\u2019s relationship with Cayley, but its import is not limited to this context. Recent criticism of \u201cMonna Innominata\u201d has explored its complex intertextual operations, particularly its revisionary treatment of the sonnet form, whose gender roles Rossetti deliberately and self-consciously reverses by having the unnamed lady, traditionally the silent object of the male sonneteer\u2019s desire, express her love. In doing so, Rossetti is emulating the gender subversion of\u00a0Sonnets from the Portuguese\u00a0(1850), by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, to whom she refers in her preface as \u201cthe Great Poetess of our day and nation.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAlthough it is not the title poem, \u201cMonna Innominata,\u201d with its valedictory mode, its questioning of the very possibility of fulfilled desire, and its reappraisal of the sonnet form, sets the tone for\u00a0A Pageant and Other Poems.\u00a0Rossetti opens the volume with a dedicatory sonnet addressed to her mother, drawing attention both to the expectations raised by the tradition of the genre\u2014 \u201cSonnets are full of love\u201d\u2014and to the preponderance of sonnets in her collection: \u201cand this my tome / Has many sonnets.\u201d But in the sonnet sequences that follow\u2014 \u201cMonna Innominata,\u201d \u201cLater Life,\u201d \u201c\u2018If thou sayest, behold, we knew it not,\u2019\u201c \u201cThe Thread of Life,\u201d and \u201c\u2018Behold a Shaking\u2019\u201c \u2014 Rossetti veers away from the amatory tradition by dwelling on the love of and aspiration for union with God. These sonnet sequences are complemented by the abundance of multipart poems in the volume, such as \u201cThe Months: A Pageant,\u201d \u201cMirrors of Life and Death,\u201d and \u201c\u2018All thy works praise Thee, O Lord.\u2019 A Processional of Creation,\u201d as well as smaller poetic sequences, such as the seasonal sequence \u201cAn October Garden,\u201d \u201c\u2018Summer is Ended,\u2019\u201c and \u201cPassing and Glassing\u201d and the three Easter poems, \u201cThe Descent from the Cross,\u201d \u201c\u2018It is finished,\u2019\u201c and \u201cAn Easter Carol.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nAnticipating the final farewell to youth, beauty, and song in \u201cMonna Innominata,\u201d in \u201cThe Key-note\u201d Rossetti laments \u201cthe Winter of my year\u201d and the silencing of \u201cthe songs I used to know.\u201d Similarly, desire is relinquished in \u201cTill Tomorrow\u201d:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Long have I longed, till I am tired\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of longing and desire;\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Farewell my points in vain desired,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My dying fire;\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Farewell all things that die and fail and tire.\n\r\nBy reiteration and accretion the passing months, the progression of seasons, and blooming and fading flowers become poignant and nostalgic symbols of the process of aging. Some poems provide consolation, as when the robin in \u201cThe Key-note\u201d \u201csings thro\u2019 Winter\u2019s rest\u201d or in the title poem, \u201cThe Months: A Pageant,\u201d a performance piece consisting of a procession of personifications of the twelve months, where \u201cOctober\u201d offers comfort: \u201cNay, cheer up sister. Life is not quite over, / Even if the year has done with corn and clover.\u201d But the real movement of the volume is toward relinquishment of love, beauty, Italy, hope, and life itself. The final poems of the non-devotional section return to the seasonal, vegetative cycle. \u201cAn October Garden\u201d begins, \u201cIn my Autumn garden I was fain / To mourn among my scattered roses,\u201d while the next poem, \u201c\u2018Summer is Ended,\u2019\u201c asks if bliss will inevitably end as the rose does, a \u201cScentless, colourless, . . . meaningless thing.\u201d The following poem, \u201cPassing and Glassing,\u201d confirms the human analogy readable from \u201cwithered roses . . . the fallen peach,\u201d and \u201csummer joy that was,\u201d saying that \u201cAll things that pass / Are woman\u2019s looking glass; / They show her how her bloom must fade.\u201d\n\r\nFamiliar Rossetti themes are in evidence in the devotional pieces: renounced desire, weariness with this life, the \u201cvanity of vanities\u201d refrain, and God\u2019s love for the unworthy supplicant. Rossetti\u2019s youthful verses had been called morbid, and death remains a central theme in\u00a0A Pageant and Other Poems\u00a0but with an altered emphasis. While in earlier verses death was presented in its more-sentimental aspect, often intruding into the frailty of romantic love, in\u00a0A Pageant and Other Poems\u00a0it is contemplated in a subdued and personal way, as a foreseeable and inevitable event. In the sonnet sequence \u201cLater Life: a Double Sonnet of Sonnets\u201d Rossetti writes, \u201cI have dreamed of Death:\u2014what will it be to die / Not in a dream, but in the literal truth / With all Death\u2019s adjuncts ghastly and uncouth.\u201d Always doubting her worthiness of salvation, Rossetti imagines her deathbed and acknowledges the possibility that she \u201cMay miss the goal at last, may miss a crown.\u201d In \u201cThe Thread of Life,\u201d a sequence of three sonnets, the speaker contemplates the essential and solitary self, aloof from external objects and bound by \u201cinner solitude,\u201d and realizes that \u201cI am not what I have nor what I do; / But what I was I am, I am even I.\u201d This self, her \u201csole possession,\u201d she offers to God. The relation of the self to the external world is again contemplated in \u201cAn Old-World Thicket,\u201d which begins with an epigraph from Dante and is obviously engaged with the legacy of Romanticism.\n\r\nIn \u201c\u2018All Thy Works Praise Thee, O Lord.\u2019 A Processional of Creation\u201d all aspects of the created world declare God\u2019s glory, each according to its nature. In \u201cSpring and Autumn\u201d the two seasons declare, respectively, \u201cI hope,\u2014 / And I remember,\u201d and these vernal and autumnal attitudes resonate through the volume. In \u201cLater Life\u201d the speaker is \u201cglancing back\u201d on \u201cLost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack, / Hopes that were never ours yet seemed to be.\u201d The devotional poems trace the yielding of unfulfilled earthly hopes in exchange for the heavenly reward. This life is full of \u201cpromise unfulfilled, of everything, / That is puffed vanity and empty talk.\u201d Paradoxes abound in \u201cLater Life\u201d as Rossetti writes, \u201cThis Life we live is dead for all its breath,\u201d \u201cIts very Spring is not indeed like Spring,\u201d and she looks for rebirth through \u201cDeath who art not Death.\u201d The conundrum/insight is reiterated in the pair of sonnets titled \u201c\u2018Behold a Shaking\u2019\u201c: \u201cHere life is the beginning of our death, / And death the starting-point whence life ensues; / Surely our life is death, our death is life.\u201d The final poems bring a satisfying closure to the volume, looking past the end of this life and ending with a divine embrace in \u201c\u2018Love is as strong as death.\u2019\u201c Though sales were sluggish,\u00a0A Pageant and Other Poems\u00a0was a critical success: the sonnet sequences, in particular, were praised by reviewers, and \u201cMonna Innominata\u201d was compared favorably with\u00a0Sonnets from the Portuguese.\n\r\nDante Gabriel Rossetti\u00a0died in Birchington on Easter Sunday 1882. Christina\u2019s commemorative poem, \u201cBirchington Churchyard,\u201d was published in\u00a0The Athenaeum\u00a0(25 April 1882). The following winter she composed her fourth book of devotional prose,\u00a0Letter and Spirit: Notes on the Commandments\u00a0(1883), in which she considers the Ten Commandments in terms of Christ\u2019s two great commandments, to love thy God and thy neighbor. \u201cA Harmony on First Corinthians XIII,\u201d first published in the January 1879 issue of\u00a0New and Old, a church magazine, was revised and included as an appendix.\nRossetti\u2019s next book,\u00a0Time Flies: A Reading Diary, published in 1885, is both the most readable and the most autobiographical of her devotional works. As the subtitle suggests, the book is diarylike in structure, with daily entries consisting of meditations on religious feast days and saints\u2019 days, poetic compositions, or personal reflections and reminiscences. The most often quoted passages are those in which Rossetti describes her experiences of nature and elaborates on the moral and symbolic meaning suggested by them. She regards a spider attempting to escape its own shadow as \u201ca figure of each obstinate impenitent sinner, who having outlived enjoyment remains isolated irretrievably with his own horrible loathsome self.\u201d One glimpses Rossetti\u2019s affection for God\u2019s smallest creatures in the pleasure she took in visiting a garden where she \u201csat so long and so quietly that a wild garden creature or two made its appearance: a water rat, perhaps, or a water-hunting bird.\u201d She goes on, \u201cFew have been my personal experiences of the sort, and this one gratified me.\u201d\u00a0\nAfter her mother\u2019s death in 1886 Rossetti continued to keep house for her elderly aunts Charlotte and Eliza until their deaths in 1890 and 1893, respectively, while working on a commentary on the Book of Revelation. The last of Rossetti\u2019s six devotional studies,\u00a0The Face of the Deep: A Devotional Commentary on the Apocalypse, published in 1892, bears the familiar dedication to her mother, but now \u201cfor the first time to her beloved, revered, cherished memory.\u201d A substantial work,\u00a0The Face of the Deep\u00a0consists of wide-ranging, free-association meditations on each verse of Revelation. While some passages engage in traditional exegesis, others are more personally contemplative and address issues of spiritual and moral duty. More important for today\u2019s reader,\u00a0The Face of the Deep\u00a0includes more than two hundred poems; Rossetti combined them with poems from\u00a0Called to Be Saints\u00a0and\u00a0Time Flies\u00a0into a volume of devotional poems titled simply\u00a0Verses.\u00a0Published in 1893 by the S.P.C.K., this collection of 331 religious lyrics was Rossetti\u2019s last volume to appear during her lifetime. She undertook extensive revisions and arranged the poems into eight sections that form a double poetic sequence: spiritual progress is traced in terms of the individual\u2019s relationship with God in the first four sections and from a universal perspective in the final four. Rossetti\u2019s devotional poems have received scant critical attention, but\u00a0Verses\u00a0enjoyed great popularity and continued to be reprinted well into the twentieth century.\nIn 1892 Rossetti was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy that was performed in her own home. The cancer recurred the following year, and after months of acute suffering she died on 29 December 1894. Rossetti had attained fame as a poet and had earned high regard as a spiritual guide; some had even speculated, after Tennyson\u2019s death in 1892, that she would make a suitable successor to the laureateship. After her death many articles appeared with personal reminiscences, expressing admiration of her saintliness and assessing her poetry and prose. The sole surviving sibling, William made special efforts to document his sister\u2019s life and edit her work. In\u00a0New Poems, Hitherto Unpublished or Uncollected\u00a0he made available carefully edited and annotated texts of poems from periodicals and anthologies and many unpublished ones, some written late in Rossetti\u2019s life and others that she had written earlier but had not published presumably because she deemed them either too personal or not up to the standard of her best work.\u00a0Maude\u00a0appeared in 1897 and\u00a0The Poetical Works\u00a0in 1904; the latter remained, despite its awkward divisions and arrangement, the standard edition of her poetry until Rebecca W. Crump\u2019s\u00a0The Complete Poems of Christina Rossetti: A Variorum Edition\u00a0(1979- 1990), which prompted a modern reassessment of Rossetti\u2019s poetry.\n\r\nWhile many other women poets are still in the process of being \u201crediscovered,\u201d Rossetti is undergoing a radical revaluation which promises a new appreciation of the complexity and variety of her work. In the century after her death her reputation survived largely on the strength of \u201cGoblin Market\u201d and a handful of lyrics. Her lyric gift has never been doubted, but the unassuming tone and flawless finish of these compositions has sometimes led critics to suggest that their lyric purity is achieved at the expense of intellectual depth and aesthetic complexity. Such assessments have been bolstered by William\u2019s description of her as a \u201ccasual\u201d and \u201cspontaneous\u201d poet to whom verse came \u201cvery easily, without her meditating a possible subject,\u201d and without her having to undertake substantial revisions. More recently critics have expressed suspicion of William\u2019s reconstruction of his sister\u2019s life, his censorship of her letters, and his revisionist editing in the posthumous collections of her poetry.\nFor several decades after her death Rossetti criticism tended to be narrowly biographical, her mournful lyrics and fantastic allegories being used to construct narratives of agonizing conflict between secular and sacred impulses, renounced love, and repressed passion. In the 1980s a Rossetti renaissance began as feminist critics undertook a reexamination of her poetry, addressing particularly \u201cGoblin Market\u201d and exploring Rossetti\u2019s representation of sororal bonds, female creativity, and sexuality and her critique of patriarchal amatory values and gender relations. The trends today run toward a proliferation of critical approaches, many of which re-contextualize Rossetti in Victorian culture, and toward critical interest in a wider range of her works, including her fiction, nonfiction, and children\u2019s poetry. Critics continue to study Rossetti\u2019s response to and influence in a women writers\u2019 tradition; also under discussion are gender-conscious models for positioning Rossetti in the mainstream (that is, predominantly male) canon. Christina Rossetti has often been called the greatest Victorian woman poet, but her poetry is increasingly being recognized as among the most beautiful and innovative of the period by either sex.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Victorian"]}}
