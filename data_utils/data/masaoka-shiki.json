He attended University Preparatory College and Tokyo Imperial University, before dropping out from the latter due to illness. He worked for a newspaper and signed up as a war correspondent to China in 1895.\nMasaoka Shiki was influential in developing a modern style of Japanese haiku and tanka, writing essays on the subject. He wrote a book on his poetics, Utayomi-ni-atauru-sho (A Book Bestowed on Composers of Poems) and also edited the journal Hototogisu (Cuckoo) that featured haiku. He proposed a realistic style of haiku featuring \u201csketches\u201d of life. His own haiku described contemporary life: as he was dying from tuberculosis, he composed haiku depicting his illness.\nMasaoka Shiki died in 1902. His works are available in Masaoka Shiki: Selected Poems (1988) translated by Burton Watson and featured in Janine Beichman\u2019s Masaoka Shiki: His Life and Works (2002).\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Asia, East"]}}
