Her poetry uses dark humor, rhyme, and received form to explore loss, family, ephemera, and the natural world. In the\u00a0New York Times, poet Carol Muske-Dukes praised its \u201cpowerful and practiced repertory of formal gestures, including a startling backhand of wit and irony,\u201d observing that \u201c[i]t is compassion, tenderness for all the beauty and dross of the world, that turns her eye away from her own reflection and toward the enumeration of odd blessings.\u201d The New Yorker described her poems as \u201cgrand and almost terrifying.\u201d\n\r\nKinsolving\u2019s collections of poetry include Peripheral Vision (2019) \u00a0The White Eyelash\u00a0(2003), Among Flowers (1994), and \u00a0Dailies & Rushes\u00a0(1999), which was a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist. Her libretti have been performed by the Baroque Choral Guild, the National Opera America Center, and the Glimmerglass Opera. Kinsolving has won the Poetry Society of America\u2019s Lyric Poetry Award as well as several international fellowships. She has taught at the Bennington Writing Seminars, the University of Connecticut, the California Institute of the Arts, and the Hotchkiss School.\n\r\nShe lives in Lakeville, Connecticut.\ufeff\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
