Romanticism\u2019s major themes\u2014restlessness and brooding, rebellion against authority, interchange with nature, the power of the visionary imagination and of poetry, the pursuit of ideal love, and the untamed spirit ever in search of freedom\u2014all of these Shelley exemplified in the way he lived his life and live on in the substantial body of work that he left the world after his legendary death by drowning at age 29. From the beginning of his writing career at the age of 17, throughout his life, and even to the present day, the very name of Shelley has evoked either the strongest vehemence or the warmest praise, bordering on worship. More than any other English Romantic writer, with the possible exception of his friend\u00a0George Gordon, Lord Byron, Shelley\u2019s life and reputation have had a history and life of their own apart from the reputation of his various works, and one that contiued to evolve even after his death from drowning at the age of 29. Born on August 4, 1792\u2014the year of the Terror in France\u2014Percy Bysshe Shelley (the \u201cBysshe\u201d from his grandfather, a peer of the realm) was the son of Timothy and Elizabeth Shelley. As the elder son among one brother, John, and four sisters, Elizabeth, Mary, Margaret, and Hellen, Percy stood in line not only to inherit his grandfather\u2019s considerable estate but also to sit in Parliament one day. In his position as oldest male child, young Percy was beloved and admired by his sisters, his parents, and even the servants in his early reign as young lord of Field Place, the family home near Horsham, Sussex. Playful and imaginative, he devised games to play with his sisters and told ghost stories to an enrapt and willing-to-be-thrilled audience.\nHowever, the idyllic and receptive world of Field Place did not prepare him for the regimented discipline and the taunting boys of Syon House Academy, which Shelley entered in 1802. Here Shelley was subjected to the usual bullying, made all the worse by his failure to control his temper and his poor skills in fighting. The most positive memories Shelley had of his two years at Syon House were undoubtedly of the imaginative and lively lectures of Adam Walker on science\u2014electricity, astronomy, and chemistry\u2014an interest which Shelley retained throughout his life. In Shelley\u2019s free-ranging mind there was no contradiction between an interest in science and an appetite for trashy Gothic romance thrillers, such as Matthew Gregory Lewis\u2019s popular\u00a0The Monk\u00a0(1795).\nShelley\u2019s six years at Eton College, which he entered at age 12 in 1804, are more notable for his early love interests and for his early literary endeavors than for what he learned in the formal curriculum. Shelley was often bullied and taunted with epithets such as \u201cMad Shelley\u201d and \u201cShelley the atheist,\u201d a situation alleviated sometimes by the intervention of his older cousin, Tom Medwin, who was later to become one of Shelley\u2019s first biographers. The strongest adult influence on Shelley during this time was not one of his masters but Dr. James Lind, the physician to the royal household at nearby Windsor, whom Shelley admired for his knowledge and free spirits and idealized as a kind of substitute father figure. As Newman Ivey White notes, Dr. Lind was the prototype of the benevolent old man who frees Laon from prison in\u00a0The Revolt of Islam. Shelley\u2019s access to Dr. Lind\u2019s extensive library enabled him to pursue his earlier interests in science and magic as well as to begin a wide range of reading in philosophy and literature. By the end of his career at Eton he was reading widely in Plato, Pliny, and\u00a0Lucretius, reading Robert Southey enthusiastically and Walter Scott less so, as well as continuing to read many Gothic romances.\nWhile at Eton Shelley began two pursuits that would continue with intense fervor throughout his life: writing and loving, the two often blending together so that the loving becomes the subject of the writing. Although Shelley began writing poems while at Eton, some of which were published in 1810 in\u00a0Original Poetry; by Victor and Cazire\u00a0and some of which were not published until the 1960s as\u00a0The Esdaile Notebook, it was perhaps inevitable that his first publication should have been a Gothic novel,\u00a0Zastrozzi\u00a0(1810). As is typical of popular Gothic romances at the time, the innocent and virtuous hero and heroine, Verezzi and Julia, and the villains, Matilda and Zastrozzi, are broadly drawn. It is noteworthy that Shelley put his heretical and atheistical opinions into the mouth of the villain Zastrozzi, thereby airing those dangerous opinions without having them ascribed to him as the author or narrator. It was reviewed twice, one a suspiciously favorable review and the other a predictably vehement attack, the first but not the last to associate the author\u2019s name with \u201cimmorality.\u201d\nShelley\u2019s other publication prior to entering Oxford,\u00a0Original Poetry; by Victor and Cazire\u2014a joint effort by Shelley and his sister Elizabeth\u2014deservedly met the same fate with the critics as\u00a0Zastrozzi, one reviewer having described the volume as \u201csongs of sentimental nonsense, and very absurd tales of horror.\u201d These early reviews, however justified they may have been concerning his juvenilia, set the tone for his treatment by the critics throughout his career, even for many of his greatest works. While the doggerel verse does not foreshadow Shelley\u2019s mastery of the lyric, the subject matter of the poems is characteristically Shelleyan: poetry, love, sorrow, hope, nature, and politics. Shelley\u2019s love interest in these poems was his cousin Harriet Grove, but their relationship was discouraged by their families.\nWhen Shelley went up to University College, Oxford, in 1810 he was already a published writer and a voracious reader with intellectual interests far beyond the scope of the prescribed curriculum. Timothy Shelley, proud of his son and wanting to indulge his apparently harmless interests in literature, could not have foreseen where it might lead when he took Shelley to the booksellers Slatter and Munday and instructed them as follows: \u201cMy son here has a literary turn; he is already an author, and do pray indulge him in his printing freaks.\u201d\nShortly after entering Oxford, Shelley met fellow freshman Thomas Jefferson Hogg, and this meeting that was to change both their lives forever after, perhaps Hogg\u2019s even more than Shelley\u2019s. The two young men immediately became fast friends, each stimulating the imagination and intellect of the other in their animated discussions of philosophy, literature, science, magic, religion, and politics. In his biography of Shelley, Hogg recalled the time they spent in Shelley\u2019s rooms, reading, discussing, arguing, and Shelley performing scientific experiments.\nDuring his brief stay at Oxford, where he remained for less than a year, Shelley had published two comparatively harmless attempts at Gothic fiction and poetry, as well as a prose pamphlet,\u00a0The Necessity of Atheism\u00a0(1811). That pamphlet was to have a disastrous effect on his relationship with his family and a dramatic effect on his life. Written mostly before he arrived at Oxford, Shelley\u2019s second Gothic romance, St. Irvyne; or, The Rosicrucian, is notable for the appearance of a prototypical Shelleyan poet figure, though its two plots are hopelessly complicated and confusing, and, in the opinion of many commentators, unfinished. It appears that in the early excitement of college life and other interests, Shelley lost interest in following through on what was to have been a full-blown three-decker romance.\nShelley and Hogg\u2019s joint collection of poems,\u00a0Posthumous Fragments of Margaret Nicholson\u00a0(1810, the title character taken from \u201cthat noted female who attempted the life of the King [George III] in 1786\u201d), was purported to have been found and edited by \u201cJohn Fitzvictor,\u201d the two authors wisely having decided to place neither of their names on the title page in that age when both author and publisher could easily end up in prison on convictions of treason and sedition. The slender volume includes a mixed bag of poems, including Gothic and melancholy lyrics as well as an antiwar, antimonarchical poem simply titled \u201cWar,\u201d notable for being the first appearance of Shelley\u2019s lifelong attack on monarchies and all authority figures.\nIndeed Shelley and Hogg\u2019s decision to publish Shelley\u2019s\u00a0Necessity of Atheism, together with their sending copies of it to the conservative Oxford dons, seems more calculated to antagonize authority than to persuade by rational argument. Actually the title of the pamphlet is more inflammatory than the argument, which centers upon \u201cthe nature of belief,\u201d a position Shelley derived from the skeptical philosophies of John Locke and David Hume. Belief cannot come from a voluntary act of will; the burden of proof for belief can be found in only three sources: the senses, reason, or testimony. Nevertheless, the Oxford authorities acted swiftly and decisively, expelling both Shelley and Hogg in March 1811. The two could probably have been reinstated with the intervention of Shelley\u2019s father, but they would have had to disavow the pamphlet and declare themselves Christians. Mr. Shelley insisted upon the additional demand that they should not see each other for a stipulated period of time. Shelley was intransigent, not only refusing to accede to his father\u2019s demands but taking an insulting and high tone with him as well. The result was a complete break between Shelley and his father, which entailed financial distress for Shelley at least until he would come of age two years hence. Thus early in his life Shelley demonstrated his idealism by his willingness to sacrifice comfort and security rather than compromise his principles or beliefs.\nFor the next two years Shelley\u2019s personal and financial affairs demanded so much of his attention and energies that he had little left to devote to literary ventures. After his expulsion from Oxford, in addition to being occupied with financial matters and keeping company with Hogg, Shelley\u2019s attentions were given to two women, Elizabeth Hitchener, his philosophical \u201csoul sister\u201d and correspondent, and Harriet Westbrook, an attractive young woman of 16 whom Shelley had met through his sister Hellen.\nApparently acting more from motives of principle and from the idea that he might mold the impressionable young Harriet than from real love for her, Shelley impulsively decided to \u201crescue\u201d her from her oppressive situation at her boarding school in Clapham. Shelley and Harriet eloped to Edinburgh, where, Shelley violating his principle of Godwinian free love in favor of Harriet\u2019s happiness and reputation, they were married on August 28 or 29, 1811. The couple was soon joined by Hogg, who went with them to York and, being unable to pursue Shelley\u2019s plan for a liaison between Hogg and Shelley\u2019s sister Elizabeth, promptly fell in love with Harriet and tried to seduce her\u2014a pattern he was to repeat, later falling in love with Mary Shelley and eventually settling down with Jane Williams. Shelley\u2019s principles of free love could have accommodated a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois but not without Harriet\u2019s willing consent, so Hogg was effectively made an outcast. Though the breach was partially healed, he never again enjoyed the same intimacy with Shelley as he had had before this incident.\nShelley and Harriet, accompanied by Harriet\u2019s sister Eliza, whose presence Shelley found increasingly oppressive, decided to leave York\u2014probably to escape Hogg\u2014and settle in Keswick in November 1811. Here Shelley met Robert Southey, whose\u00a0Thalaba\u00a0(1801) and\u00a0Curse of Kehama\u00a0(1810) he had much admired. But Shelley began to see the older poet as an apostate from radicalism, especially since Southey patronized him and tried to steer him away from radical causes. Shelley became much more interested in meeting another of his cultural heroes: William Godwin, whose\u00a0Political Justice\u00a0(1793) had been for Shelley a book to live by. Upon hearing that the author of his moral and political bible was still living, Shelley immediately introduced himself to Godwin. This acquaintance was to have at least as much influence on Shelley\u2019s personal life as his reading of\u00a0Political Justice\u00a0had on his political ideas.\nWhile at Keswick Shelley conceived a plan to put his radical political ideas into action. He had been working on a pamphlet simply titled\u00a0An Address, to the Irish People\u00a0(1812), and nothing less would do than publishing it, distributing it, and delivering it in person to its intended audience, the oppressed Irish Catholics. Shelley, Harriet, and Eliza arrived in Dublin in February 1812 and began to distribute the pamphlet, which favored Catholic emancipation but cautioned the Irish to proceed slowly so as not to be drawn into violence.\nAnother \u201cIrish\u201d pamphlet,\u00a0Proposals for an Association of those Philanthropists, followed closely upon the first (March 1812). Despite Godwin\u2019s misgivings, expressed strongly to Shelley in letters, lest radical organizations might follow the path of the Jacobinical societies that led to the French Terror, Shelley realized that the Irish would not attain any degree of freedom without unity and organization. The\u00a0Proposals\u00a0are Shelley\u2019s earliest public statement of the way in which love and politics should be inseparable: \u201cLove for humankind\u201d should \u201cplace individuals at distance from self,\u201d thereby promoting \u201cuniversal feeling.\u201d Shelley felt that he could do no more in Ireland, so the Shelleys and Eliza settled briefly in Cwm Elan, Wales, where Shelley continued to write radical pamphlets. He distilled the arguments in\u00a0An Address\u00a0and the\u00a0Proposals\u00a0in\u00a0Declaration of Rights, a broadside which he distributed with the help of his servant Daniel Healey (or Hill), who was arrested, technically for distributing a broadside without a printer\u2019s name on it, but really because the material was subversive. This episode incensed Shelley about how little real freedom of the press existed in England; his response was another pamphlet,\u00a0A Letter to Lord Ellenborough\u00a0(1812), an eloquent argument in favor of freedom of the press and of speech. Rather than pleading his own case, Shelley wisely focuses on the well-publicized trial of Daniel Isaac Eaton, a London bookseller who had been sentenced to prison for publishing partof Paine\u2019s\u00a0The Age of Reason.\nAmid financial difficulties, local gossip about an immoral household, and fears that Shelley himself might be arrested, the Shelleys and Eliza, now accompanied by Elizabeth Hitchener, who had joined them in Lynmouth, prudently decided to flee and stay for a while near Tremadoc. During this early period of his life, Shelley had quietly been composing poems in a notebook, which fell into the hands of the Esdaile family after Shelley\u2019s death and which was not published until this century, as\u00a0The Esdaile Notebook\u00a0(1964). The poems included therein are an interesting mix of very personal poems, treating his feelings for Harriet and some of his moments of despair and isolation, and public, political, and social poems, treating themes of liberty, the Irish cause, the plight of the poor, the futility of war, and his hatred of religious hypocrisy and monarchies. Partaking of the central metaphors of poetic discourse of this time, showing the influence of\u00a0William Wordsworth, the poems in\u00a0The Esdaile Notebook\u00a0are written in straightforward language and reiterate the power of nature and the naturalness of poetry. Devoid of mythology, these poems rely upon common personal and political allusions, the 18th-century convention of abstractions, contemporary lyric forms, genres, and content. Writing these poems was for Shelley a kind of poet\u2019s apprenticeship, which he did not feel confident about bringing to the public\u2019s eye during his lifetime.\nThe Shelleys spent periods during 1812 and 1813 in London, where Shelley was able to make new acquaintances among liberal and literary circles and to renew earlier friendships such as those with Hogg and\u00a0Leigh Hunt, a radical London publisher and writer who was to be Shelley\u2019s lifelong defender. In addition, Shelley became a member of the Boinville circle, an informal literary discussion group, and met Thomas Hookham, a radical bookseller and publisher, and another aspiring writer, Thomas Love Peacock, who became a kind of friendly literary foil for Shelley and later one of his biographers. In October 1812 Shelley finally met his political father, Godwin, who, like Elizabeth Hitchener (expelled from the Shelley circle), failed to live up to Shelley\u2019s idealized image of him. Instead of inspiring Shelley with his political wisdom and intellect, Godwin became a nagging financial burden to Shelley for the rest of his life.\nShelley\u2019s major literary project at this time was\u00a0Queen Mab, printed by his friend Hookham in May or June of 1813.\u00a0Queen Mab\u00a0is a political epic in which the fairy queen Mab takes the spirit of Ianthe (the name Percy and Harriet gave their first child, born in June 1813) on a time and space journey to reveal the ideal nature of humanity\u2019s potential behind the mistakes of history and the blind acceptance of \u201coutward shows\u201d of power. The poem reiterates many of the themes of Shelley\u2019s political pamphlets, attacking the oppressiveness of religious dogma and superstition as well as of customs and institutions such as the monarchy. The poem\u2019s perspective is utopian, viewing the pettiness and selfishness of the world from distant, lofty heights and suggesting the great potential of the uncorrupted human soul. The utopian and visionary perspectives of the poem foreshadow the apocalyptic and millennial vision of Shelley\u2019s later poetry. That Shelley was using poetry to convey radical political ideas in response to the threats of freedom of the press is clear in his feeling the necessity to assure Hookham that \u201ca poem is safe: the iron-souled attorney general would scarcely dare to attack.\u201d Lest his philosophical or political points should get lost in the poetry, Shelley added copious prose notes to the end of the poem, the familiar attacks on religion, monarchy, and wealth, the advocacy of vegetarianism, free love, and free beliefs, and explanatory notes on geology, astronomy, necessity, and the labor theory of value.\u00a0Queen Mab\u00a0was distributed only privately at the time it was printed, but in 1821 it began to appear in unauthorized, pirated editions, somewhat to Shelley\u2019s embarrassment. Interestingly enough, the poem became a kind of radical bible to many in the Chartist movement in the 1830s and 1840s.\nOnce Shelley became a frequent visitor to the Godwin household, it was inevitable that he would meet the three young women living there:\u00a0Mary Godwin, Jane (later Claire) Clairmont, and Fanny Imlay. It was equally inevitable that all three women would fall in love with Shelley in varying degrees and that Shelley should fall in love with Mary. As the daughter of Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft (whose writings Shelley had already read and admired), Mary represented to Shelley an ideal offspring of two great minds. Growing up in the Godwin household had exposed Mary to ideas, and she could read freely in the books in Godwin\u2019s library; moreover, she had an independent mind and was willing to argue with Shelley, rather than be passively molded by him, like Harriet. Perhaps the only real tragedy was that Shelley had not met Mary before he married Harriet. Although Shelley believed he was following Godwin\u2019s principles of free love in replacing Harriet with Mary as the object of his highest love and in offering Harriet to live with them as his sister rather than his wife, Godwin bitterly opposed the relationship, and Harriet became estranged and completely shattered. Knowing that Godwin and his wife would do what they could to stop them, Shelley and Mary, accompanied by Jane Clairmont, eloped on the night of July 27, 1814, first to Calais, then to Paris, and on to Switzerland. After a six-week stay, the three were forced to return to England because of money problems.\nUpon their return to London, the Shelleys were ostracized for their elopement, especially by the Godwins, and Shelley, at least until his grandfather Bysshe died in January 1815, had to spend much of his time trying to raise money from post-obit bonds in order to meet Harriet\u2019s needs and satisfy his own many creditors. Harriet gave birth to a son, Charles, in November 1814, and in February 1815 Mary gave birth prematurely to a child who died only two weeks later. In his usual pattern Hogg conceived a love for Mary, and Shelley, with Mary\u2019s initial consent, agreed to the experiment in free love, but Mary lost interest.\nShelley\u2019s only publication in 1814,\u00a0A Refutation of Deism: in a Dialogue, is a two-pronged attack on what he regarded as the crumbling superstructure of the established institutions of religious belief in early-19th-century England. Directed toward intellectuals and Deists,\u00a0A Refutation of Deism picks apart the arguments supporting both Christianity and Deism, thus leaving atheism as the only rational ground to stand upon.\nWith improved finances and health in 1815, Shelley not only found the time to write poetry but began to develop a more sophisticated and symbolic style that foreshadows his mature productions. The volume published in 1816,\u00a0Alastor; or, The Spirit of Solitude: and Other Poems, is Shelley\u2019s public initiation into the Romantic idiom of poetry pioneered by Wordsworth and perhaps directly inspired by the publication of\u00a0The Excursion\u00a0in 1814.\nAlastor, with its use of symbols, visionary elements, and mythic sources (the Narcissus-Echo myth in particular), marks a real advance over Shelley\u2019s earlier efforts in writing poetry. There are elements of autobiography in the poem, both in the sense that Shelley felt himself to be haunted by real (his creditors) or imagined (assailants) spirits at various times in his life and in the sense that in his personal relationships he had made and would again make the same mistake that the Poet makes: of seeking \u201cin vain for a prototype of his conception\u201d of the idealized part of himself. In the preface to the poem Shelley cautions against this solitary quest, warning not only that such pursuits will result in the neglect of one\u2019s social duties but that they will lead one to loneliness, alienation, and ultimately death.\nYet what gives\u00a0Alastor\u00a0vibrancy and tension\u2014life\u2014is that it is not a didactic morality poem; it is a subtle and complex poem in which the two kinds of poetry represented by the Narrator, the Wordsworthian poet of nature, and the visionary Poet of genius are drawn into a kind of complementary conflict. The Narrator relates the story of the Poet\u2019s life and quest, interspersing his narration with panegyrics to nature. Like his famous literary counterparts\u2014Werther, St. Preux, the Solitary, Childe Harold\u2014the Poet is alienated early in life, travels, and becomes a wanderer searching for some truth that will give his life meaning.\nThe year 1816 proved to be exciting for Shelley, Mary and Claire Clairmont. In January, Mary gave birth to a son, named William after her father. In the spring Claire threw herself at Lord Byron, recently separated from Lady Byron, and became his mistress. In May she persuaded Shelley and Mary to alter their plans for a trip to Italy and go to Lake Geneva instead, where she knew Byron was headed. The two poets found each other stimulating and spent much time together, sailing on Lake Geneva and discussing poetry and other topics, including ghosts and spirits, into the night. During one of these ghostly \u201cseances,\u201d Byron proposed that each person present\u2014himself, Shelley, Mary, Claire, and his physician, Dr. John Polidori\u2014should write a ghost story. Mary\u2019s contribution to the contest became the novel\u00a0Frankenstein; published in 1818 with a preface by Shelley, it became one of the most popular works of the whole Romantic period.\nShelley was deeply impressed with the power of the natural scenery, brought on by the combination of the lake and the surrounding mountains, especially Mont Blanc.He was stimulated to write two of his finest poems: \u201cHymn to Intellectual Beauty\u201d and\u00a0\u201cMont Blanc: Lines Written in the Vale of Chamouni.\u201d The \u201cHymn to Intellectual Beauty\u201d reveals the influence of Wordsworth. As Wordsworth does in \u201cTintern Abbey,\u201d Shelley in the \u201cHymn to Intellectual Beauty\u201d suggests how his imagination and poetic sensitivity were formed by nature, and more significantly, by visitations from the shadowy power of intellectual beauty and how, in turn, he dedicated his poetic powers to intellectual beauty.\nIn\u00a0Mont Blanc\u00a0Shelley discovers a similar but even more enigmatic power, but the conclusion he reaches is more skeptical, less Wordsworthian. Shelley chose a familiar romantic topic for this poem: the awesome effect on the observer wrought by Mont Blanc in particular or the Alps in general. Though Shelley admired the new kind of poetry ushered in by Wordsworth and Coleridge, he was equally convinced by 1815 that both the older poets were political apostates, having sold out to religion and the political status quo in the reaction that followed Napoleon\u2019s defeat. Thus the relationship with nature that Shelley explores in\u00a0Mont Blanc\u00a0is more ridden with skepticism and doubt than the pantheism of Wordsworth or the Christian revelation of Coleridge. The only meaning the poet can draw from the mountain\u2019s impenetrable, impassable visage is what his own imagination can supply. To the imaginative observer the mountain provides a parable of creation and destruction in its lower reaches and valleys and of unknowable permanence and power in the majestic solitudes of its uppermost heights. Probably no passage in Shelley\u2019s canon has been more widely disputed than the final three lines of\u00a0Mont Blanc:\nAnd what were thou, and earth, and stars, and sea,\r\nIf to the human mind\u2019s imaginings\r\nSilence and solitude were vacancy?\nThe enigmatic mountain leaves the speaker with no assurance that the imagination may endow with meaning the awful blankness of nature.\nAfter their return to England, Shelley and Mary were faced with the disasters of two suicides: Fanny Imlay, Mary\u2019s half-sister and an admirer of Shelley, and Harriet, Shelley\u2019s wife. Since both women had been, at least at one time, in love with Shelley, Shelley and Mary must have felt in some measure responsible. Shelley married Mary on December 30, 1816, and became involved in drawn-out court proceedings with the Westbrooks, led by his old adversary Eliza, over the custody of Shelley and Harriet\u2019s children, Ianthe and Charles. Some of Shelley\u2019s writings, most prominently\u00a0Queen Mab, were cited during the proceedings to show that Shelley held moral and religious opinions that rendered him unfit to assume custody. By the time the case was finally decided in 1818, with Lord Eldon making provisions for the children to be cared for by a guardian, the Shelleys were in Italy with Shelley never to return to England.\nIn March of 1817 the Shelleys settled in Marlow, an environment that provided the flexibility of moving in literary circles and the tranquillity needed for thinking and writing. Now more friendly with Mary and Shelley, probably because of their marriage, Godwin was a visitor. In addition to regular conversations with Peacock, Shelley became good friends with Leigh Hunt and met some of the young writers in Hunt\u2019s circle, including\u00a0John Keats\u00a0and Horace Smith. Given the fact that Shelley\u2019s liberal friends and acquaintances were politically opposed to the reactionary forces in England after Napoleon\u2019s defeat, it is not surprising that Shelley\u2019s writings during his Marlow period are politically charged: two pamphlets,\u00a0A Proposal for Putting Reform to the Vote Throughout the Kingdom\u00a0and\u00a0An Address to the People on the Death of the Princess Charlotte, and one political epic,\u00a0The Revolt of Islam.\nShelley signed both pamphlets \u201cThe Hermit of Marlow.\u201d The first suggests petitions to increase suffrage, along the lines of what would eventually be put into practice in the 1832 Reform Bill. The second pamphlet is a rhetorical tour de force in which Shelley chastises even liberals, borrowing a phrase from Thomas Paine\u2019s\u00a0The Rights of Man: \u201cWe pity the plumage but forget the dying bird.\u201d Shelley suggests that in the public outpour of mourning over the untimely death of Princess Charlotte, people, even the friends of liberty and reform, have neglected the executions of three laborers, who in turn become symbols of all the poor and the unjustly treated.\nShelley was again confronted with the problem of censorship with his longest poem in its original version, with its original title:\u00a0Laon and Cythna; or, The Revolution of the Golden City: A Vision of the Nineteenth Century, which was withdrawn after only a few copies were published. Even the comparatively liberal Ollier brothers, Shelley\u2019s publishers, objected to the brother-sister incest between the two title characters and to some of the attacks on religion. Shelley took out the incestuous relationship, deleted other objectionable passages, and republished the poem as\u00a0The Revolt of Islam; A Poem, in Twelve Cantos. His description of the poem in the preface suggests some of its structural difficulties: \u201cIt is a succession of pictures illustrating the growth and progress of individual mind aspiring to excellence, and devoted to the love of mankind.\u201d Dedicated to the idea that \u201clove is celebrated everywhere as the sole law which should govern the moral world,\u201d\u00a0The Revolt of Islam\u00a0provides a poetic forum for Shelley to condemn oppression, religious fraud, war, tyrants, and their consequences\u2014\u201ccivil war, famine, plague, superstition, and an utter extinction of the domestic affection\u201d\u2014and to recommend hope, enlightenment, love, \u201cmoral dignity and freedom.\u201d\nShelley probably wrote\u00a0Rosalind and Helen, A Modern Eclogue\u00a0before he left England, though the poem was not published by Ollier until 1819. Shelley derives the relationship between Rosalind and Helen from the friendship that had existed between Mary Shelley and Isabel Baxter before her husband, a domestic tyrant like Rosalind\u2019s husband, caused the friendship to be broken off. For shock value Shelley introduces the incest theme in the relationship between Rosalind and her brother and the theme of free love in the relationship between Helen and Lionel, whose prototypes are Laon and Cythna. As an aristocrat who writes radical poetry, Lionel appears to be based upon Shelley himself. After both women lose their male lovers, they turn to each other in sisterly love, exchanging tales of woe and social injustice.\nThe Shelleys and their children, William and Clara, along with Claire and Allegra, set out for Italy in March 1818. They went for reasons of health and finances, and to take Allegra to her father. For Shelley\u2019s development as a poet the change of climate proved fruitful, for he was to write some of his greatest poetry under the clear Italian skies. Once in Italy, Shelley found himself in the delicate position of having to mediate between Claire and Byron over Allegra, which later resulted in Allegra being placed in a convent and dying. The expatriates stayed in Pisa and Leghorn before settling for the summer in Bagni di Lucca, in the Apennines. They found congenial company in John and Maria Gisborne and her son, Henry Reveley, an engineer developing a steamboat.\nTwo poems written at Este, \u201cLines Written among the Euganean Hills\u201d and\u00a0Julian and Maddalo, grew out of Shelley\u2019s experiences in the summer and fall of 1818. The immediate source for \u201cLines\u201d is a day spent in the Euganean Hills overlooking Padua and Venice. The emotional source is Shelley\u2019s misery over the death of his child Clara in September 1818 and Mary\u2019s subsequent depression. Shelley concludes this beautiful poem with a wish for domestic tranquillity for himself and those he loves and a hope that the world will recognize its brotherhood and \u201cgrow young again.\u201d\nJulian and Maddalo, not published until its inclusion in\u00a0Posthumous Poems\u00a0(1824), is Shelley\u2019s most direct poetic treatment of his relationship with Lord Byron. In the poem Julian (Shelley) takes the side of optimism and hope in the face of despondency and evidence of misery, while Maddalo (Byron) takes a pessimistic view, stemming partly from his pride. For the side of hope Julian cites the beauty of Nature in this \u201cParadise of Exiles, Italy!\u201d and the natural goodness of childhood, describing Shelley\u2019s own play with Byron\u2019s child Allegra as evidence: \u201cA lovelier toy sweet nature never made, / A serious, subtle, wild, yet gentle being.\u201d Julian asserts the power of the mind over itself: \u201cWhere is the love, beauty, and truth we seek / But in our mind?\u201d\nMaddalo accuses Julian of talking \u201cUtopia,\u201d citing as evidence for his pessimism a madman who was once as idealistic as Julian. Each thinking he will support his own arguments, they decide to visit the madman, whom commentators have variously identified as Tasso or as Shelley\u2019s alter ego. But the madman\u2019s soliloquy is inconclusive. He says that part of his suffering is his own doing, but part seems inflicted upon him from some outside power. However, he has retained his ideals and integrity, still believing in the possibility of social reform and eschewing revenge against his lover, who has scorned him for her paramour. He believes that love leads to misery, suggesting, \u201cThere is one road to peace and that is truth.\u201d After hearing the madman\u2019s soliloquy, both Julian and Maddalo are subdued and feel pity. Maddalo concludes, \u201cMost wretched men / Are cradled into poetry by wrong, / They learn in suffering what they teach in song.\u201d Julian returns many years later only to find Maddalo away, the madman and his lover dead, and Maddalo\u2019s child a grown woman. He learns from her that the madman\u2019s lover returned for a while but deserted him once again. He finally agrees with the woman that \u201cthe cold world shall not know\u201d the last private details of the madman\u2019s misery. Many of the other poems Shelley wrote during this same period, such as the fine lyric \u201cStanzas Written in Dejection near Naples,\u201d depict Shelley\u2019s despair over his estranged relationship with Mary and were also not published until\u00a0Posthumous Poems\u00a0.\nShelley provided rapturous descriptions of his travels in Italy in his letters to Peacock, expressing his particular delight in Roman ruins. But these delights were balanced by yet another tragedy, the death of their son, William, in June 1819. An additional cause for despair was what came to be known as the \u201cHoppner Scandal,\u201d so called because the Shelleys\u2019 discharged servant Elise Foggi had related to the Hoppners, Byron\u2019s friends in Venice, that unbeknownst to Mary, Claire had born Shelley a child in Naples. Records support the existence of Shelley\u2019s \u201cNeapolitan Charge,\u201d Elena Adelaide Shelley, but to this day scholars view the parentage of this child as speculative.\nDuring this 1818-1819 period Shelley wrote what many consider to be his masterpiece,\u00a0Prometheus Unbound\u00a0(1820), subtitled\u00a0A Lyrical Drama, perhaps to suggest a hybrid genre. Shelley had been developing the symbolism, imagery, and ideas for the poem for several years. For example, he states in the preface that \u201cthe imagery which I have employed will be found \u2026 to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind,\u201d a technique he had already used in\u00a0Mont Blanc. Shelley had had a longstanding interest in and familiarity with Aeschylus\u2019s\u00a0Prometheus Bound, even translating it for Byron, but he could not accept the idea that Aeschylus had bound the champion of mankind for eternity, or even worse, that Prometheus would have been reconciled with Jupiter in Aeschylus\u2019s lost drama, the sequel to\u00a0Prometheus Bound. As Shelley avers in the preface, \u201cI was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the Champion with the Oppressor of mankind.\u201d The choice of Prometheus as his hero is not surprising, given this mythological character\u2019s association with rebellion and isolation from his act of giving fire to man against the gods\u2019 wishes and his reputation as a \u201cforethinker\u201d or prophet. For Shelley he came to symbolize the mind or soul of man in its highest potential.\nShelley knew that\u00a0Prometheus Unbound\u00a0would never be popular, but he thought that it might have a beneficial influence on some already enlightened intellects. In letters to his publisher Ollier, Shelley proclaimed that although this was his \u201cfavorite poem,\u201d he did not expect it to sell more than 20 copies and instructed Ollier to send copies to Hunt,\u00a0Peacock, Hogg, Godwin, Keats, Horace Smith,\u00a0Thomas Moore, and Byron. The reviewers were predictably harsh in their condemnation of the poem\u2019s moral and political principles, but there was also praise, with words such as \u201cbeauty\u201d and \u201cgenius\u201d used in various reviews.\nIn the same volume as\u00a0Prometheus Unbound, Ollier published \u00a0were some of Shelley\u2019s finest extended lyrics, including \u201cOde to the West Wind,\u201d \u201cThe Cloud,\u201d \u201cTo a Skylark,\u201d and \u201cOde to Liberty.\u201d Written in the autumn of 1819 when the Shelleys were in Florence, \u201cOde to the West Wind\u201d employs natural imagery and symbolism to foretell not only a change in the physical but in the political climate. Writing in terza rima to suggest the force and pace of the wind, Shelley asks the wind to drive him forth as it does the leaves, the clouds, and the waves so that his poetic song will have the same irresistible power for change to awaken Earth:\nScatter as from an unextinguished hearth\r\nAshes and sparks, my words among mankind!\r\nBe through my lips to unawakened Earth\r\nThe trumpet of a prophecy!\nAlmost immediately after finishing the first three acts of\u00a0Prometheus Unbound, Shelley began work on another drama,\u00a0The Cenci\u00a0(1819). This time instead of using mythology and classical literature as his source material, he used the true Renaissance story of the macabre Cenci family, the villainous count and his virtuous daughter, Beatrice. Shelley believed that this drama, unlike\u00a0Prometheus Unbound, would be popular and stageable, even suggesting his favorite actress for the part of Beatrice. The Gothic trappings, the elimination of \u201cmere poetry,\u201d and the absence of didactic political instruction were calculated to make the drama accessible to a wide audience.\nShelley\u2019s political disclaimer in the preface is, of course, belied by the fact that Beatrice\u2019s rebellion against her tyrannical father is yet another version of Shelley\u2019s lifelong struggle against any form of authority, be it kingly, priestly, or fatherly. Count Cenci acts on the assumption that his patriarchal power is absolute, sanctioned as it is by the Pope, the head of Church and State. He knows no checks, first toasting his sons\u2019 deaths in a bizarre parody of the communion ceremony, then raping Beatrice. In Shelley\u2019s hands Beatrice\u2019s murderous revenge is a revolutionary act against patriarchal authority, not a personal vendetta.\nIn his hope that the play would be read widely and staged, Shelley again misjudged the predominance of conservativism in the literary milieu of Regency England. The taboo theme of incest, the horror of parricide, the \u201cblasphemous\u201d treatment of religion, the implicit attack on the family and all patriarchal institutions, and Shelley\u2019s own dangerous reputation\u2014all broke the rules of Regency society and ensured\u00a0The Cenci\u00a0would be condemned by all but a few reviewers and friends, such as Leigh Hunt, to whom the play is dedicated. The play was staged only once in the 19th century, by the Shelley Society in 1886.\nShelley\u2019s political ire was stirred in 1819 by what came to be known as the Manchester Massacre, or \u201cPeterloo.\u201d During an assembly in St. Peter\u2019s fields, where a crowd was to be addressed by \u201cOrator\u201d Hunt, the local militia charged the crowd, killing at least nine people and wounding many more. Shelley\u2019s response was to write several explicitly political poems, including\u00a0The Masque of Anarchy\u00a0(1832), the sonnet \u201cEngland in 1819,\u201d and \u201cSong to the Men of England,\u201d all of which were deemed too dangerous to publish during Shelley\u2019s lifetime, even by his friends.\u00a0It likely frustrated Shelley that none of his attempts in poetry and prose to address explicitly the political events of 1819 and 1820 were published during his lifetime.\nLest Shelley should be thought of as only a humorless reformer where politics is concerned and a serious visionary where poetry is concerned, two satires,\u00a0Peter Bell the Third\u00a0and\u00a0Oedipus Tyrannus; or, Swellfoot the Tyrant, and two light-hearted poems, the \u201cLetter to Maria Gisborne\u201d and\u00a0The Witch of Atlas, suggest the contrary. Perhaps these more playful poems, written in late 1819 and during 1820, were an outlet after his intensive poetic efforts in 1819.\nShelley was prompted to write\u00a0A Defence of Poetry, one of the most eloquent justifications of poetry ever written, after reading Peacock\u2019s 1820 essay \u201cThe Four Ages of Poetry,\u201d in which his friend had lightheartedly taken a cyclical view of poetry and history and had reached the conclusion that poetry was in decline, with the current age representing one of the low points in the cycle. But\u00a0A Defence of Poetry\u00a0goes well beyond Peacock\u2019s essay in the scope and vision of its comprehensive definitions of poetry, poets, and imaginative creation. Shelley defines poetry to include all of the arts and all creative endeavors that bring permanent beauty or goodness to the world. Shelley\u2019s statement that \u201ca Poet participates in the eternal, the infinite, and the one\u201d illustrates that poetic creations are not subservient to the vicissitudes of history but rather partake of the Platonic realm of permanent forms and ideas. The inspiration that endows imaginative poets with a momentary vision into the realm of the beautiful and the permanent is another manifestation of Shelley\u2019s \u201cintellectual beauty.\u201d And yet Shelley argues that the social and moral benefits of poetry are real. Poetry can help moral progress keep pace with scientific and material progress, and as \u201cthe unacknowledged legislators of the World,\u201d poets can indirectly influence social consciousness for the better.\nIn addition to Byron, the Gisbornes, the Masons, and Teresa Viviani, the Shelleys\u2019 Pisan circle of friends grew to include the eccentric Professor Francesco Pacchiani, who introduced them to Prince Mavrocordato, interesting to the Shelleys and to Byron for his involvement in the Greeks\u2019 struggle against the Turks for independence. In 1821 Edward and Jane Williams both became intimate friends with the Shelleys, and in 1822 they all met the literary adventurer Edward John Trelawny, who would become another of Shelley\u2019s biographers. Moreover, Shelley had hopes that Hunt and Keats might come to Italy. Upon hearing Keats was ill, he warmly invited him to Italy as his guest, but Keats died in Rome on February 3, 1821, before Shelley even knew he was in Italy. Perhaps not realizing the nature or the seriousness of Keats\u2019s consumption, Shelley labored under the misconception that the harsh reviews of\u00a0Endymion\u00a0(1818) precipitated Keats\u2019s illness and death. He was in this frame of mind as he quickly set about writing an elegy on the young poet.\nDrawing upon the Greek elegies of Bion and Moshcus as well as upon Milton\u2019s\u00a0Lycidas, Shelley probably derived his title,\u00a0Adonais, as Earl R. Wasserman suggests, from Bion\u2019s\u00a0Lament for Adonis\u00a0and the Hebrew \u201cAdonai\u201d myth. Comprising 55 Spenserian stanzas, the poem begins as a conventional elegy with a call to Urania, muse and mother of the poet, as well as to all of nature, to mourn. But in the spring nature revives, emphasizing the contrast with the still-dead Keats, as a procession of his fellow poets\u2014Byron, Moore, Hunt, and Shelley himself\u2014comes forth, Shelley characterizing himself both as a \u201cfrail Form\u201d and as \u201cA pardlike Spirit beautiful and swift.\u201d Shelley directs some vicious attacks toward the reviewer he holds responsible for Keats\u2019s death, but the attacks may stem from his own treatment by the critics as much as from a desire to avenge Keats. Beginning with stanza 39, a reversal takes place as the speaker proclaims Adonais \u201cis not dead, ... / He hath awakened from the dream of life.\u201d From this point on Keats is apotheosized as a star in a Platonic realm of permanent beauty: \u201cThe soul of Adonais, like a star / Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are.\u201d Like many of Shelley\u2019s heroes and heroines, Adonais in death escapes the shadowy and mutable world and passes into \u201cthe white radiance of Eternity.\u201d\nShelley\u2019s enthusiasm for the stirrings of independence in Greece prompted him to write\u00a0Hellas\u00a0(1822), which he dedicated to Prince Mavrocordato. As the title\u00a0Hellas\u00a0suggests, Shelley is most concerned with the liberty of the Hellenic spirit: as he says in the preface, \u201cWe are all Greeks. Our laws, our literature, our religion, our arts have their root in Greece.\u201d The \u201cLyrical Drama\u201d is \u201ca series of lyric pictures\u201d spoken or sung by a chorus of captive Greek women interspersed with dialogue between the main characters\u2014the Turkish Sultan Mahmud, his aid Hassan, the Wandering Jew Ahasuerus, and the Phantom of Mahomet III. The chorus pays homage to the eternal spirit of liberty and expresses hope for the Greek victory as Mahmud gradually draws the conclusion that the Turkish forces are losing. Above all, Shelley is concerned that the thought and ideals of Greece are preserved, not just the outward manifestations of present-day Greece:\nBut Greece and her foundations are\r\nBuilt below the tide of war,\r\nBased on the crystalline sea\r\nOf thought and its eternity.\nThe poem ends with the\u00a0final chorus\u00a0prophecying in a soaring vision, \u201cThe world\u2019s great age begins anew,\u201d suggesting that another golden age, like the first one in Greece, will return to the world.\nIn what was to be the last year of his life\u20141822, Shelley was frustrated in his efforts to mediate between Byron and Claire over Allegra, irritated with the Olliers\u2019 delays, and depressed over what seemed to be Mary\u2019s increasing estrangement. He admired the apparently loving relationship between the Williamses, and not surprisingly developed at least a platonic love for the beautiful Jane Williams. Out of these feelings of despondency and admiration Shelley wrote some of his most musical lyrics, including \u201cLines: \u2018When the lamp is shattered,\u2019\u201d \u201cTo Jane: The Invitation,\u201d \u201cTo Jane: The Recollection,\u201d \u201cTo Jane (\u2018The keen stars were twinkling\u2019),\u201d and \u201cLines written in the Bay of Lerici.\u201d\nIn May 1822 the Shelleys and the Williamses left Pisa in order to rent Casa Magni on the Bay of San Terenzo, near Lerici. Here Shelley and Edward would be able to spend the summer sailing the\u00a0Don Juan, their new boat, in the Gulf of Spezia. Though Mary was disconsolate, Shelley was generally happy and set about writing his last long poem, the fragmentary\u00a0The Triumph of Life. Shelley uses\u00a0Petrarch\u2019s\u00a0Trionfi\u00a0and\u00a0Dante\u2019s\u00a0Divine Comedy\u00a0as models. The former provides the structure of a triumphal procession; the latter, the model of a guide leading the poet to a new understanding and the rhyme scheme, terza rima. In a vision the poet sees a chaotic procession of \u201clife\u201d in the midst of which is a chariot guided by a \u201cJanus-visaged Shadow,\u201d suggesting that this pageant has no goal or purpose. The poet is shocked to see Rousseau, the spiritual leader of Romanticism, his eyes now burned out. Other famous figures, such as Voltaire, Frederick the Great, and Immanuel Kant, appear in the procession, as Rousseau explains that they were all overcome by life and offers up an axiomatic dilemma: \u201cwhy God made irreconcilable / Good and the means of good\u201d? Only \u201cthe sacred few who could not tame / Their spirits to the Conqueror\u201d (Life) have held themselves out of the corrupted procession: those who died young (one thinks of Keats) and those who resisted life\u2019s corrupting influences, such as Socrates and Jesus.\nAt this point the poet\u2019s vision of the pageant of life gives way to Rousseau\u2019s vision of his own story. Rousseau relates seeing a form brighter than the sun, \u201cA Shape all light,\u201d a female form reminiscent of intellectual beauty and other ideal manifestations having to do with the poet\u2019s creative powers. In the hopes of quenching his thirst for knowledge, Rousseau accepts a drink from the cup offered by the Shape, but the effect is to eclipse his vision of the Shape with the vision of a \u201ccold bright car,\u201d the same chariot leading the pageant of life. In the error of attempting to realize the ideal, a pattern recurrent in many of Shelley\u2019s poems, Rousseau has lost the vision of the ideal. In one of those ironic twists of fate that seem to bring literature and life together, near the end of the poem the poet asks Rousseau, \u201cThen what is Life?\u201d Shelley, who believed that the complete answer to this question might lie in a realm beyond this life, died before he could write the answer. Though many, including\u00a0T.S. Eliot, not usually an admirer of Shelley, believe that in\u00a0The Triumph of Life\u00a0Shelley achieved a style and vision superior to all of his other writings, how the poem would end, whether optimistically or pessimistically, and what more Shelley might have achieved will be left to conjecture.\nIt is certainly tempting to speculate what additional literature might have been given the world had Keats, Hunt, Byron, and Shelley all been allowed to live in each other\u2019s company in Italy. At the time of Shelley\u2019s death a project had been hatched to bring Hunt to Italy, where he would begin a journal called\u00a0The Liberal, with Shelley and Byron as principal sponsors and contributors. After several delays the Hunts had finally arrived in Leghorn, so Shelley and Edward Williams sailed from Lerici to greet them, leaving Mary and Jane at Casa Magni. After getting the Hunts settled in, Shelley and Williams set sail in the\u00a0Don Juan\u00a0for the return trip to Lerici on July 8, but a squall enveloped and overcame the boat. After Mary, Jane, and their friends had undergone several days of anxious waiting with rapidly diminishing hopes, Shelley\u2019s and Williams\u2019s bodies were discovered washed ashore on July 18. One of the identifying objects on Shelley\u2019s body was an open copy of Keats\u2019s 1820 volume of poems. Italian quarantine laws required that bodies washed ashore be burned, so Shelley was cremated in the presence of Byron, Hunt, and Trelawny. Trelawny began one of the Shelley legends\u2014that Shelley\u2019s heart, too pure to burn, would be preserved\u2014when he plucked Shelley\u2019s unburned heart and part of his jawbone from the fire. He later arranged for Shelley\u2019s ashes to be buried near Keats\u2019s grave in the Protestant Cemetery in Rome and is responsible for one of the epitaphs that appear on Shelley\u2019s gravestone, three lines from\u00a0The Tempest: \u201cNothing of him that doth fade / But doth suffer a sea-change / Into something rich and strange.\u201d\u00a0The other epitaph on the stone was Leigh Hunt\u2019s idea: \u201cCor Cordium,\u201d or \u201cHeart of Hearts.\u201d\nThe Pisan circle broke up shortly afterward, with Mary and her son Percy Florence (born in November 1819), Jane and her children, and the Hunts returning to England and with Byron dying less than two years later in his efforts to help the Greeks in their struggle for independence. Mary had difficulties with Sir Timothy, Shelley\u2019s father, who would allow her a small pension only on the condition that nothing by or about Shelley be published during Sir Timothy\u2019s lifetime. She nonetheless edited the\u00a0Posthumous Poems\u00a0(1824) and a collected edition of\u00a0Poetical Works\u00a0with her own explanatory notes (1839), and she published a novel,\u00a0The Last Man\u00a0(1826), with a Shelleyan protagonist. Hunt continued to be a valiant defender of Shelley\u2019s works and reputation, and both Hogg, who, true to form, fell in love with another of Shelley\u2019s beloved women (Jane Williams), and Peacock published biographies. Percy Florence Shelley eventually inherited the Shelley estate and married Jane St. John, an admirer of both his parents, who did all she could to preserve and enshrine Shelley\u2019s reputation.\nShelley\u2019s reputation after his death was shaped by the same extremes of worship and hatred that he and his writings had elicited during his life. Among the Victorians,\u00a0Thomas Carlyle, Charles Kingsley, Walter Bagehot, and\u00a0Ralph Waldo Emerson\u00a0denigrated Shelley, and Samuel Clemens was never able to forgive Shelley for his treatment of Harriet.\u00a0Matthew Arnold\u00a0issued the most memorable and damaging statement on Shelley: \u201cbeautiful and ineffectual angel, beating in the void his luminous wings in vain.\u201d But the list of those who admired him or were influenced by him is longer and perhaps even more distinguished: Benjamin Disraeli, who created a Shelleyan protagonist in his novel\u00a0Venetia\u00a0(1837);\u00a0Robert Browning, who in his early poem\u00a0Pauline\u00a0(1833) paid tribute to Shelley as the \u201cSun-treader\u201d;\u00a0Alfred Tennyson, who along with other \u201cCambridge Apostles\u201d argued the merits of Shelley versus Byron with Oxford debaters; William Butler Yeats, whose poetry reveals the influence of Shelley\u2019s visionary poetics and his symbol making; H.S. Salt and Edward and Eleanor Marx Aveling (Marx\u2019s daughter), all of whom claimed Shelley as a prototypical Marxist; and Bernard Shaw, who admired Shelley\u2019s radicalism and emulated his vegetarianism. In addition,\u00a0Edgar Allan Poe,\u00a0Algernon Charles Swinburne,\u00a0George Eliot, George Lewes, and\u00a0Thomas Hardy\u00a0 admired Shelley and adopted some of his ideas.\nShelley worship reached its zenith in 1886 with the formation of the Shelley Society, the idea for which came from F.J. Furnivall, the son of Shelley\u2019s physician at Marlow. In addition to republishing several of Shelley\u2019s works, the society succeeded in, at long last, staging\u00a0The Cenci. Because licensing laws that forbade staging scenes of incest, the production was for members only, with Browning, Wilde, and Shaw among those in attendance. Through the efforts of American, British, and Roman committees, Keats\u2019s last residence, at 26 Piazza di Spagna in Rome, was purchased and on April 3, 1909 was formally dedicated as the Keats-Shelley Memorial House.\nIn the early 20th century, however, Shelley\u2019s literary reputation plunged to its nadir with the advent of the \u201cnew humanism\u201d and the \u201cnew criticism.\u201d Paul Elmer More and Irving Babbit attacked Romanticism in general and Shelley in particular for being simple, irrational, and dangerous. T.S. Eliot and F.R. Leavis criticized Shelley for being adolescent and for having \u201ca weak grasp upon the actual.\u201d But again Shelley\u2019s reputation has arisen from the ashes by the efforts of respected scholars and critics of the latter half of this century\u2014including Newman Ivey White, Carlos Baker and Harold Bloom\u2014who have found in Shelley\u2019s writings an inexhaustible fountainhead of social, political, and philosophical concerns, complexities and subtleties in his use of myth and language, including his skill in translating Greek, Italian, Spanish, and German literature, and rich relationships with his cultural milieu. His name forever linked with those of Byron and Keats, Shelley has come to symbolize the free and soaring spirit of humankind. Even in the popular imagination, he is associated with the idea that one should not content oneself with the mundane but aspire to ever-loftier ideals of perfecting the self, and above all, with the idea of hope. Though Shelley\u2019s works will never be read by the masses, at least the spirit of his wish in \u201cOde to the West Wind\u201d is perhaps closer to coming true today than he would have dared imagine:\nby the incantation of this verse,\r\nScatter, as from an unextinguished hearth\r\nAshes and sparks, my words among mankind!\nShelley\u2019s ideas, embodied in his verse, his prose, and his life, remain as a challenge to the servile acceptance of authority and as a challenge to us to achieve our highest potential\u2014to always aspire to higher goals for ourselves and for society.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Romantic"]}}
