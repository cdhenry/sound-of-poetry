He is renowned for the quiet beauty of his compact, meditative lyrics. He is the author of many poetry collections, including Angel Hill (2017); The Stairwell (2015), which received the 2015 International Griffin Poetry Prize; The Ghost Orchid (2012); The Weather in Japan (2000), which won the Irish Times Literature Prize for Poetry, the Hawthornden Prize, and the T.S. Eliot Prize; and Gorse Fires (1991), winner of the Whitbread Poetry Prize. In 2001 Longley was awarded the Queen\u2019s Gold Medal for Poetry. He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.\nKnown for using classical allusions to cast provocative light on contemporary concerns\u2014including Northern Ireland\u2019s \u201cTroubles\u201d\u2014Longley\u2019s poetry is also marked by sharp observation of the natural world, deft use of technique, and deeply felt emotion. His debut volume, No Continuing City (1969), heralded the arrival of a new voice from a region which had already produced recognized talents like Seamus Heaney and Derek Mahon. Longley\u2019s early influences were English poets like Philip Larkin, Louis MacNeice, World War I poets, as well as masters from the classical tradition. The critic Langdon Hammer has described Longley\u2019s poems as masterpieces of \u201clucidity, economy, sincerity \u2026 by means of meticulous, unpretentious technique.\u201d When asked in a 1998 interview about the formal discipline that helps him produce four- and two-line poems, Longley replied, \u201cWas it Tennyson who said that a perfect lyric inscribes the shape of an S? That sense of a gesture, you know, the way you use your hand if you\u2019re bowing, if you\u2019re reaching out to shake somebody\u2019s hand, if you\u2019re going to stroke a cat, if you\u2019re holding a woman\u2019s hand to take her on to the dance floor.\u201d\n\r\nLongley\u2019s work engages diverse subjects, including Homeric literature, the landscape of Carrigskeewaun, jazz, Walter Mitty, and the politics of Northern Ireland. On the public and political responsibilities of being a Northern Irish poet, he has commented, \u201cThough the poet\u2019s first duty must be to his imagination, he has other obligations\u2014and not just as a citizen. He would be inhuman if he did not respond to tragic events in his own community, and a poor artist if he did not seek to endorse that response imaginatively.\u201d Reviewing his Selected Poems (1993), critic Fran Brearton praised in particular Longley\u2019s more political poems, noting his \u201cuse of a compassionate yet unsentimental voice, and an attention to detail which restores specificity at a point in history when it is most in danger of being lost in abstraction\u2014numbers, dates, death-tolls counted beyond comprehension.\u201d\nLongley is married to the critic Edna Longley. They live in Belfast, Ireland.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Ireland & Northern Ireland"]}}
