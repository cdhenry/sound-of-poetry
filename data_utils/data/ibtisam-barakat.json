She grew up under Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank, received a BA in English literature from the West Bank\u2019s Birzeit University, and emigrated to the United States in 1986. She first settled in New York City, where she interned for The Nation, and later earned a dual master\u2019s degree\u2014in journalism, and in human development and family studies\u2014from the University of Missouri, Columbia.\n\u201cMy writing is a clear and spacious window,\u201d Barakat states in a feature on her life on the Institute for Middle East Understanding\u2019s website. \u201cI know whether it\u2019s morning or it\u2019s night, whether it\u2019s a rainy day or a summer day, and whether it\u2019s a season of freedom outside and inside or a season of fear, all through what I see reflected in my writing.\u201d Barakat\u2019s free-verse, short-lined poems often use metaphor as a point of entrance in their explorations of themes such as healing, peacemaking, and children\u2019s experiences of war.\nHer memoir, Tasting the Sky: A Palestinian Childhood (2007), received considerable critical acclaim, was chosen by Booklist as one of the Top Ten Biographies for Youth, received the 2008 International Reading Association\u2019s Best Nonfiction Book Award for Children and Young Adults as well as the Arab American National Museum Book Award for Children\u2019s Literature, and has been translated into several languages. Barakat\u2019s second memoir, Balcony on the Moon: Coming of Age in Palestine (2016) received praise in Booklist, Kirkus, Publishers Weekly, and many other publications.\nBarakat\u2019s stories and poems have been anthologized in Shattered (2002);\u00a0The Flag of Childhood (2002),\u00a0edited by Naomi Shihab Nye;\u00a0Teaching Powerful Writing: 25 Read-Aloud Stories (2001), and elsewhere. In 1994 Barakat won the National Library of Poetry\u2019s Outstanding Poetry Award.\nBarakat has taught at Stephens College and is the founder of the Write Your Life seminars.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
