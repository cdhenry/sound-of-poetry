Describing herself as \u201can intuitive and exploratory poet\u201d in a 2006 interview with Marisol Teresa Baca in 42opus, Hogue stated that particularly in her collection The Incognito Body (2006), \u201cI'm interested in social-economic power: how it is used; whether it is shared; what happens when one shifts the dynamic to power-sharing, for example, which listening, on a very deep level, can begin to do.\u201d  \u00a0 Her numerous collections of poetry include Revenance (2014), Or Consequence (2010), Flux (2002), and Touchwood (1979). Hogue is the author of the critical volume Scheming Women: Poetry, Privilege, and the Politics of Subjectivity (1995). She edited The Sword Went Out to Sea (Synthesis of a Dream) by Delia Alton, by H.D.

Hogue collaborated on the interview-based volume of poetry and photographs When the Water Came: Evacuees of Hurricane Katrina (2010) with photographer Rebecca Ross. She received the Academy of American Poets\u2019 Harold Morton Landon Translation Award for her co-translation of Virginie Lalucq and Jean-Luc Nancy\u2019s Fortino S\u00e1mano, or The Overflowing of the Poem (2012). \u00a0 Hogue\u2019s additional honors include a grant from the Arizona Commission on the Arts, fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Fulbright Foundation, and the H.D. Fellowship at Yale University\u2019s Beinecke Library and the Witter Bynner Translation Residency Fellowship at the Santa Fe Art Institute.
