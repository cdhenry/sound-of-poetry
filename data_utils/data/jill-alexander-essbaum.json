Speaking to this unusual combination of themes in an interview with Eratosphere, Essbaum observed, \u201cWhy the pairing of sexual and religious expression seems wrong to our post-modern American ears, I think, is because we\u2019re all (no matter what we believe or don\u2019t) direct inheritors of a Puritan heritage that disdains human physicality \u2026 in lieu of pursuits of the spirit alone.\u201d In a Coldfront review of Necropolis, critic Rick Marlatt noted, \u201cKnown for their remarkable mix of eroticism and religiosity, Jill Alexander Essbaum\u2019s poems vibrate with well-proportioned rhymes, unforgettable imagery and a unique\u00a0realization\u00a0of form.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nEssbaum\u2019s debut collection of poems, Heaven (2000), won the 1999 Bakeless Prize. Other collections include Harlot (2007), Necropolis (2008), and the long-poem chapbook The Devastation (2009). Her work has been included in the anthology Best American Erotic Poems (2008). Essbaum\u2019s novel Hausfrau (2015) was a New York Times Bestseller, named one of the best books of the year by the San Francisco Chronicle, the Huffington Post, and Shelf Awareness, and nominated for the PEN/Robert W. Bingham Prize for Debut Fiction.\nThe recipient of two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, Essbaum has served as an editor for the online journal ANTI- , the print journal The National Poetry Review, and has also edited for the Nanopress Project, whose aim is to \u201cpioneer a new poetry publishing model that brings together, on a one-time basis, an independent editor\u2019s judgment and gravitas and a poet\u2019s manuscript.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nEssbaum teaches in the University of California-Riverside Palm Desert\u2019s low-residency MFA program and lives in Austin, Texas.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
