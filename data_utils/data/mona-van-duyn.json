She earned a BA from Iowa State Teachers College and an MA from the University of Iowa. A distinguished writer whose honors included a Bollingen Prize, the Ruth Lilly Prize, the Loines Prize of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and the Shelley Memorial Prize, Van Duyn was the first woman to serve as poet laureate, from 1992 to 1993. With her husband, Jarvis Thurston, she co-founded\u00a0and co-edited the journal Perspective, a Quarterly of Literature.\u00a0She taught at the University of Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop in the 1940s, and she was a longtime lecturer in the University College adult education program at Washington University in St. Louis. Van Duyn\u2019s poetry collections include Selected Poems (2003); If It Be Not I: Collected Poems, 1959-1982 (1994); Firefall (1994); Near Changes (1990), for which she won the Pulitzer Prize; Bedtime Stories (1972); and To See, To Take (1970), which received the National Book Award in 1971.\nElizabeth Frank once described Van Duyn in the Nation as \u201ca poet who usually tries harder than any of her contemporaries to coax affirmation out of the waste and exhaustion of modern life.\u201d Known for its formal precision and exacting intelligence, Van Duyn\u2019s work has been described by the poet Alfred Corn as \u201cone of the most convincing bodies of work in our poetry.\u201d\n\r\nVan Duyn published her first poetry collection, Valentines to the Wide World, in 1958. The book heralded Van Duyn\u2019s enduring themes, including life in suburbia and domestic concerns. \u201cToward a Definition of Marriage,\u201d in which Van Duyn compares married love to a novel, a circus, and a collection of old papers, is an example of her witty appraisal of such subject matter. In her next book of poems, A Time of Bees (1964), Van Duyn addresses gardens, friendship, and life in a mental institution. \u201cUsing her characteristic half rhymes, sometimes in quatrains, sometimes in couplets, Van Duyn creates poems impressive for their intelligence and their determined attempts to find reason in an unreasonable world,\u201d noted Susan Ludvigson in the Dictionary of Literary Biography.\nVan Duyn\u2019s National Book Award-winning poetry collection\u00a0To See, To Take (1970) received much praise. William Logan once described Van Duyn\u2019s investment in the \u201cminor joys and partial surrenders\u201d of middle-class suburban life, and the collection confirmed her mastery of the terrain. Notable among the poems in this collection is \u201cMarriage, with Beasts,\u201d \u201cin which a couple\u2019s tour of a zoo prompts a consideration of love.\u201d David Kalstone, writing in the New York Times Book Review, contended that To See, To Take \u201chas a special rhythm, swinging out, exploring, detaching itself,\u201d and he hailed \u201cMarriage, with Beasts\u201d as \u201cfunniest and eeriest of all.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nVan Duyn\u2019s next collection was Bedtime Stories (1972), a series of recollections from the perspective of the author\u2019s grandmother, related in\u00a0Germanic dialect. Writing in Ploughshares, Lorrie Goldensohn observed that the poems in Bedtime Stories showcase Van Duyn\u2019s affinity for \u201cagrarian domesticity,\u201d and she noted \u201ca necessary event in the larger life of these poems: the subversion of their maturities and finish into new vitalities.\u201d Van Duyn\u2019s later volume Merciful Disguises: Poems Published and Unpublished (1973) includes verse from her earlier collections. Her book Letters from a Father, and Other Poems (1982) is a series of six poems structured as missives from father to daughter. In 1990, she published Near Changes, which features her poem celebrating her 50-year marriage to Thurston, \u201cLate Loving.\u201d In Poetry, Alfred Corn stated that, \u201c\u2018Late Loving\u2019 must be the most moving (and honest) poem ever written about marriage approaching the golden anniversary.\u201d Likewise enthused, Edward Hirsch wrote in the New York Times Book Review that Van Duyn \u201chas a gift for making the ordinary appear strange and for turning a common situation into a metaphysical exploration.\u201d He concluded that in Near Changes Van Duyn \u201chas \u2018fixed\u2019 her world with pathos and wit.\u201d\nDuring her term as poet laureate, Van Duyn published If It Be Not I: Collected Poems (1992), a formidable volume amassing her previously published verse, and Firefall (1992), a collection that included poems she described as \u201cminimalist sonnets.\u201d Rachel Hadas observed in the New York Times Book Review that Firefall \u201cvaries the pace \u2026 with skinny \u2018minimalist sonnets\u2019 that capture large themes \u2026 with aphoristic slimness.\u201d Ben Howard wrote in Poetry that this collection \u201cspeaks a human, forgiving spirit, rich in warmth and moral wisdom.\u201d\nVan Duyn\u2019s final publication was Selected Poems (2003). A Publishers Weekly critic summarized Van Duyn\u2019s art as \u201cacutely emotional poems about deceptively ordinary domestic experiences.\u201d In the Seattle Times,\u00a0Richard Wakefield\u00a0concluded\u00a0that Selected Poems \u201cilluminates many brave new worlds and shows us that they are beautiful not in spite of but, often, because of their imperfections.\u201d\nVan Duyn died\u00a0in University City, Missouri on December 2, 2004.\n", "attrs": {}}
