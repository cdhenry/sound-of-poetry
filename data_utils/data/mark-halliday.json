Halliday has published several collections of poetry, including Losers Dream On (2018);\u00a0 Keep This Forever (2008); Jab (2002); Tasker Street (1992), winner of the Juniper Prize; and\u00a0Little Star (1987), selected for the National Poetry Series.\nInfluenced by New York School poets Kenneth Koch and Frank O\u2019Hara, Halliday writes disarmingly accessible and humorous poems that use conversational markers to lead the reader on nuanced metaphysical, postmodern, and personal explorations. Using a term Halliday coined, critic David Graham describes Halliday\u2019s work as \u201cultra-talk.\u201d The New Yorker has also praised Halliday\u2019s poetry, noting, \u201cHe is prolix and quotidian, a Whitman in a supermarket, a confessional poet who does not take himself very seriously.\u201d\nHalliday\u2019s prose includes a study of Wallace Stevens, Stevens and the Interpersonal (1991), and a book on poetics, The Sighted Singer (1992), co-authored with Allen Grossman.\nHalliday has won the Rome Fellowship in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a Lila Wallace/Reader\u2019s Digest Foundation Writer\u2019s Award, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He has taught at Indiana University, Western Michigan University, and Ohio University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
