He is the author of the poetry collections Exile in Gayville (2009) and Heterophobia (2005), and the ethnographic study Gays in (Cyber)Space: Online Performances of Gay Identity (2007). Poet Patricia Smith praised Exile in Gayville for \u201cpoems unerring in their ferocity and their truths.\u201d\nFox\u2019s performance poetry uses autobiography as a lens to examine the interaction between identity politics and our ability to connect with others. In a 2007 panel on writing about race and identity, Fox observed, \u201cThe narratives of cultural others have been largely excluded from literary and historical canons. Writing about marginalized identity is something of an obligation when one considers the importance of archive. Many of us are, quite literally, writing our way into history.\u201d\nFox won third place in the 2005 National Poetry Slam, and has also been a team member of the Austin Poetry Slam. His poetry has been included in the anthologies\u00a0Freedom to Speak (2003) and\u00a0In Our Own Words Volume 3 (2000). His performances have been featured at the Nuyorican Poets Caf\u00e9 and the Bowery Poetry Club.\nFox\u2019s weekly podcast, Fox and the City, aired on Sirius Radio and won the 2006 Best Local Podcast award from the Phoenix New Times. His academic work on performance studies has been published in Text and Performance Quarterly, Journal of Homosexuality, and Qualitative Inquiry.\nFox is a professor of communication studies at California State University, Long Beach. He lives in Los Angeles.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
