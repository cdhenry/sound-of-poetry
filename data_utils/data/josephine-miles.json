Not only a skilled poet, Miles was also a brilliant scholar; she spent her career teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, and was the first woman to be awarded tenure in the English Department. She is remembered as the editor of anthologies and critical texts, as an author of books on poetic style and language, and as an award-winning poet who produced over a dozen books of poems. Her reputation rests primarily upon her accomplishments as a poet.\n\r\nThe publication of\u00a0Lines at Intersection\u00a0in 1939 introduced Josephine Miles to the general American public. She seemed set apart,\u00a0Books\u00a0reviewer Peter Craft proposed, because \u201cMiss Miles is aware of the world in which she lives and this is to her credit.\u201d However, Craft argued that her awareness is also the basis for her poetry\u2019s limitations. The New York Times\u00a0reviewer Herbert Gorman suggested a compromise as a possible remedy: \u201cIf Miss Miles will deepen her emotional center and shatter some of her composure she is very likely to achieve an eminence in American poetry that still lies some distance ahead. \u2026 That profounder utterance that is the secret of lasting poetry \u2026 has not yet been reached by her disciplined mind.\u201d\n\r\nSubsequent collections of Miles\u2019s poetry concentrated on the development of that disciplined mind and not the deepening of her emotional center. J.R. Caldwell found that\u00a0Local Measures \u201cindicates a sound maturing of her excellent and individual gift. The sharp refractions of her quietly incendiary mind \u2026 draw here to a still finer and more exact focus, and at times to needle points of white light.\u201d Dudley Fitts added his praise of the book in his\u00a0Nation\u00a0review. He wrote: \u201cMiles\u2019s talent is that of the virtuoso. Her way with words is brilliant: the control or rhythm, the arrangement of rhyme and assonance, the answering of stanza to stanza\u2014everything is elaborately and even intensely worked out.\u201d Unlike Craft, Fitts maintained that the majority of Miles\u2019s failures as a poet were not so much due to her awareness of the world as to her \u201cextraordinary preoccupation with technique.\u201d However,\u00a0Poetry\u00a0reviewer Barbara Gibbs did not necessarily see this as a problem. She viewed Miles\u2019s development as an evolution from \u201csomething that is little more than the enjoyment of vernacular speech \u2026 through a kind of sharp, humorous, and often resonant character-picture, by way of enigma, to the lyric proper.\u201d\n\u201cMiles specializes in the sly, dry, minimal observation,\u201d commented\u00a0Randall Jarrell\u00a0in\u00a0Poetry and the Age. \u201cThe poems [in\u00a0Local Measures] are full of the conversational elegance of understatement, Of a carefully awkward and mannered charm. Everything is just a little off; is, always, the precisely unexpected.\u201d Jarrell noted that while Miles\u2019s poems are easily recognized as different from those of other poets, they are hard to tell apart. \u201cTheir language, tone and mechanism of effect have a relishingly idiosyncratic and monotonous regularity.\u201d And yet, when reviewing\u00a0Poems: 1930-1960\u00a0for the\u00a0Chicago Sunday Tribune,\u00a0Gwendolyn Brooks\u00a0cautioned: \u201cThis is not poetry to be used for lullaby purposes. Eye and ear must stand awake, or much of the beauty and intellectual significance will remain on the page.\u201d\n\nHayden Carruth\u2018s 1968 review of\u00a0Kinds of Affection\u00a0took a similar view of Josephine Miles\u2019s work. He explained: \u201cHer mind is a scholar\u2019s mind in the best and broadest tradition, encyclopedically informed. Her poems\u2026 are glimpses into the drama of ideas and perceptions played by an agile intelligence.\u201d In spite of such a commendation,\u00a0Kinds of Affection\u00a0prompted Herbert Leibowitz to echo Gorman\u2019s 1939 ideas on the nature of Miles\u2019s chief failing. He placed the blame on her restraint, on \u201cthe very reasonableness and quiet civility\u201d of the poems. Leibowitz elaborated in the\u00a0Hudson Review: \u201cNot only is there no sense of protracted crisis, \u2026 but all unruly emotions are defused. \u2026 She is\u00a0too\u00a0moderate, giving the mistaken impression that she has heard of chaos second-hand.\u201d\n\nTo All Appearances\u00a0elicited more favorable reviews. Vernon Young of\u00a0Hudson Review\u00a0cited it as \u201ca noteworthy publication, especially for critics who may have taken Miss Miles too readily at her own word in the past: the empiricist prepared to eliminate from her verse all the felicities save those of the denotative voice. She had her tongue in her cheek.\u201d In the\u00a0New York Times Book Review,\u00a0Helen Vendler described Miles as having \u201cstrict expectations of the world, a comic sense of her own unrealistic hopes, a stern judgement of her own failings, and an observant, birdlike interest in classes of people unlike herself.\u201d Vendler acknowledged, \u201cShe lacks the sweeter side of verse \u2026 but her enterprise and sense of art are sure.\u201d Further praise came from\u00a0Times Literary Supplement\u00a0reviewer Denis Donoghue, who wrote: \u201cThere are twenty poems in\u00a0To All Appearances\u00a0which I would choose as evidence if challenged to show that contemporary poetry houses intelligence, magnanimity, humor, and excursive power. \u2026 Of these twenty, at least six go straight into my ideal anthology.\u201d\n\r\nMiles's Coming to Terms\u00a0won praised from prominent poet-critic Donald Davie in\u00a0Parnassus.\u00a0He believed that Miles\u2019s poems are accessible and rooted in the real world, since her \u201clandscapes \u2026 are naturally enough the narrowly defined foregrounds of her home in Berkeley. On the other hand her scenes are very thickly peopled.\u201d In crafting her poems this way, Davie explained, Miles avoided an abstract, elevated poetry in favor of poems sprung from the real world that \u201cdo not aspire to be \u2018sacred objects\u2019; \u2026 some of them might indeed be Scotch-taped for a while on to somebody\u2019s wall\u201d and thus be continuous with \u201cthe mutable traffic of daily life.\u201d\n\r\nThe final volume in Miles\u2019s poetic career was her\u00a0Collected Poems: 1930-1983,\u00a0which won the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize from\u00a0Nation\u00a0magazine and was one of three finalists for the 1983 Pulitzer Prize in poetry. The volume culls poems from her 10 books and also includes twenty-one previously uncollected poems. Jenny Penberthy in\u00a0Times Literary Supplement\u00a0characterized the poems variously as \u201cchatty,\u201d \u201cprosy,\u201d \u00a0and \u201cpolitical.\u201d Although it spans more than 50 years, the book shows, as Emily Leider pointed out in\u00a0San Francisco Review of Books, \u201ca remarkable unity of tone. Miles takes more liberties with open forms as she gets older, but the same Sane voice prevails.\u201d Alfred Corn, one of the judges who awarded\u00a0Collected Poems: 1930-1983\u00a0the Lenore Marshall award, commented in\u00a0Nation\u00a0that \u201cMiles\u2019s American dialect is recognizable as a variant of daily speech, but it\u2019s not Williams\u2019s nor Frost\u2019s nor Bishop\u2019s,\u201d and he cited\u00a0A.R. Ammons\u2019s comment that this collection is \u201cone of the finest and solidest bodies of poetry to be found in this country.\u201d\nMiles died at in 1985 at the age of 73. Confined to a wheelchair for much of her life due to rheumatoid arthritis, she died of pneumonia. \u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
