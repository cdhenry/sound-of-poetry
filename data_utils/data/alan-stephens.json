According to John Wilson, a colleague at Santa Barbara, Stephens lent \u201cdistinction to our place and the people in it. He has written of our creeks, streets, houses, beaches, mountains, schools, parks, trees, flowers, birds and beasts, and people. Not just Santa Barbara but the entire Western landscape has meant a great deal to him as a man and as a writer.\u201d \u00a0 Stephens published numerous collections of poetry in his lifetime, including The Sum (1958), In Plain Air: Poems 1958-1980 (1982), Tree Meditation and Others (1970), The White Boat and Some Other Poems (1995), and Away from the Road (1998).
