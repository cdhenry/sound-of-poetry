The poet John Kinsella wrote: \u201cJames Byrne is a phenomenon and Blood/Sugar is astonishing. Byrne has a razor-sharp wit, an acute intellect and a superb facility with language. The poetry he writes is both culturally and intellectually \u2018learned\u2019, but also rhetorically and lyrically confident. He is a complete original.\u201d Forrest Gander wrote of Everything Broken Up Dances that it is \u201clike gulping firewater shots of the world.\u201d\n\r\nByrne cotranslated and coedited Bones Will Crow (Arc, 2012), the first anthology of contemporary Burmese poetry to be published in English. He is the coeditor of Voice Recognition: 21 Poets for the 21st Century, (Bloodaxe, 2009) and editor of The Wolf: A Decade (2012).
