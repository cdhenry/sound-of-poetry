In his poetry, Lasdun explores the differences between his English roots and his adopted American home, often setting his poems in wild rural landscapes or barely tamed domestic interiors. Though written in free verse, his poetry can feel formal in its use of rhyme and cadence.\u00a0With the poet Michael Hofmann, Lasdun edited the anthology After Ovid: New Metamorphoses (1994). He has taught at many universities including Columbia University, Princeton University, and the New School. He currently lives with his family in upstate New York.\n", "attrs": {}}
