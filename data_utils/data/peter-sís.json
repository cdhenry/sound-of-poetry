After corresponding with children\u2019s author and illustrator Maurice Sendak, he moved to New York to begin a career in illustration. \u00a0 Hundreds of S\u00eds\u2019s drawings have been published in the New York Times Book Review, as well as in numerous other magazines.

Marcus notes, \u201cFor Sis as for so many others, the collapse of the Eastern bloc\u2019s oppressive governments was a dream come true. In \u201cThe Wall,\u201d the ecstatic energy and big-spirited inventiveness of the artist\u2019s drawings make the once all but unimaginable realization of that dream visible for all to see.\u201d S\u00eds has written and illustrated dozens of books for children, including The Wall: Growing Up Behind the Iron Curtain (2007), which won the Robert F.
