He was best known as guitarist, vocalist, and principal songwriter of the Velvet Underground and for his solo career, which spanned several decades. Mentored by poet Delmore Schwartz while a student at Syracuse University, Reed wrote the foreword to Schwartz's In Dreams Begin Responsibilities and Other Stories (2012).\nReed\u2019s collection of poetry and prose, Do Angels Need a Haircut, was published posthumously in 2018. The volume, comprising poems and short stories written in the early 1970s, also gathered photographs and other ephemera from Reed\u2019s early career, including audio from a 1971 St. Mark\u2019s Church reading. According to Will Hermes in Rolling Stone, the work situates Reed in the lineage of Beat and second-generation New York School poets and poetry. Poet Anne Waldman wrote the foreword and musician, performance artist, and Reed\u2019s widow, Laurie Anderson, contributed an afterword.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
