Described by Newsweek reviewer Annalyn Swan as \u201cAmerica\u2019s dean of letters,\u201d Warren was among the last surviving members of a major literary movement that emerged in the South shortly after World War I. He also achieved a measure of commercial success that eludes many other serious artists. In short, as Hilton Kramer once observed in the New York Times Book Review, Warren \u201chas enjoyed the best of both worlds. ... Few other writers in our history have labored with such consistent distinction and such unflagging energy in so many separate branches of the literary profession. He is a man of letters on the old-fashioned, outsize scale, and everything he writes is stamped with the passion and the embattled intelligence of a man for whom the art of literature is inseparable from the most fundamental imperatives of life.\u201d Warren was named first US poet laureate on February 26, 1986, and he served as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets from 1972 until 1988. He was selected as a MacArthur Fellow in 1981.\nLiterature did not always play a central role in Warren\u2019s life, however. As he recalled in an interview with John Baker published in Conversations with Writers: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to become a writer. My ambition was to be a naval officer and I got an appointment to Annapolis. ... Then I had an accident. I couldn\u2019t go\u2014an accident to my eyes\u2014and then I went to [Vanderbilt University] instead, and I started out in life there as a chemical engineer. That didn\u2019t last but three weeks or so, because I found the English courses so much more interesting. History courses were also interesting, but the chemistry was taught without imagination.\u201d\nThe freshman English teacher Warren found so fascinating was fellow Southerner John Crowe Ransom, \u201ca real, live poet, in pants and vest, who had published a book and also fought in the war. ... As a man, he made no effort to charm his students, but everything he said was interesting.\u201d Ransom, recognizing that Warren was no ordinary English student, encouraged the young man to enroll in one of his more advanced courses. He also invited Warren to join the \u201cFugitives,\u201d a group of Vanderbilt teachers and students as well as several local businessmen who had been meeting informally since around 1915 to discuss trends in American life and literature. By 1922, the year Warren joined, many of the Fugitives\u2019 discussions focused on poetry and critical theory, Warren\u2019s favorite subjects at the time. \u201cIn a very important way,\u201d says Warren in retrospect, \u201cthat group was my education.\u201d\nThe Fugitives drifted apart in the mid-1920s, about the same time Warren graduated from Vanderbilt and headed west to continue his education at the University of California, Berkeley. After earning his MA from Berkeley in 1927, Warren attended Yale University and then Oxford University, where he \u201cstumbled on\u201d writing fiction. Homesick and weary of devoting his days and nights to working on his dissertation, Warren, at the request of one of the editors of the literary annual American Caravan, agreed to compose a novelette based on the folk tales he had heard as a boy in Kentucky. As he later remarked to Baker, his contribution to the annual received \u201csome pleasant notices in the press,\u201d and soon publishers were asking him to write novels.\nThough Warren did indeed write several novels during the next decade\u2014only one of which, Night Rider (1939), was published\u2014most of his time and effort was spent trying to earn a living. Returning to Tennessee in 1930 after completing his studies at Oxford, he briefly served on the faculty of Southwestern Presbyterian University (now Southwestern at Memphis) before obtaining a teaching position at Vanderbilt. From there Warren went to Louisiana State University in 1934, teaming up with friend and fellow faculty member Cleanth Brooks to write a series of immensely successful and influential textbooks, including An Approach to Literature and Understanding Poetry. Based on the authors\u2019 class notes and conversations, these books have been largely responsible for disseminating the theories of the New Criticism to several generations of college students and teachers. According to Helen McNeil in the Times Literary Supplement, Warren and Brooks helped to establish the New Criticism as \u201can orthodoxy so powerful that contemporary American fiction and poetry are most easily defined by their rebellion against it.\u201d\nThe New Criticism\u2014a method of analyzing a work of art that focuses attention on the work\u2019s intrinsic value as an object in and of itself, more or less independent of outside influences (such as the circumstances of its composition, the reality it creates, the effect it has on readers, and the author\u2019s intention) grew out of discussions Warren had participated in first as a member of the Fugitives, then as an Agrarian. (The Agrarians were former Fugitives who banded together again in the late 1920s to extol the virtues of the rural South and to promote an agrarian as opposed to an industrial economy). Despite his close association with the Agrarians and his key role in publicizing their theories, Warren did not consider himself to be a professional critic. As he explained to Baker: \u201cI have only two roles, essentially: poetry and fiction\u2014and only a certain kind of fiction. ... A real critic, like Cleanth Brooks or I.A. Richards, has a system. ... He\u2019s concerned with that, primarily. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m interested in trying to understand this poem or that poem, but I\u2019m not interested in trying to create a system. I\u2019m interested in a different kind of understanding, you might say, a more limited kind of understanding. I\u2019m interested in my enjoyment, put it that way, more than anything else. I\u2019ve certainly written some criticism, but I usually take it from my class notes. I\u2019m just not a professional critic. That business is just something that happens. ... But writing fiction, poetry, that\u2019s serious\u2014that\u2019s for keeps.\u201d\nPoetry and fiction were thus Warren\u2019s main concerns throughout his long career, with poetry having edged out fiction as the author\u2019s preferred genre since the mid-1950s. He saw nothing unusual in the fact that he made notable contributions to both, remarking to Baker that \u201ca poem for me and a novel are not so different. They start much the same way, on the same emotional journey, and can go either way. ... At a certain level an idea takes hold. Now it doesn\u2019t necessarily come with a form; it comes as an idea or an impulse. ... I\u2019ve started many things in one form and shifted to another. ... The interesting topics, the basic ideas in the poems and the basic ideas in the novels are the same.\u201d\nFor the most part, these \u201cbasic ideas\u201d in Warren\u2019s poetry and fiction sprang from his Southern Agrarian heritage. Observes Marshall Walker in London Magazine: \u201cWarren began as an enlightened conservative Southerner. Like his close associates, John Crowe Ransom, Donald Davidson, Allen Tate, Andrew Lytle, he was acutely aware of the gulf widening between an America that moved further into slavery to material progress and a minority of artists and intellectuals, self-appointed custodians of traditional values. ... Agrarians, with Ransom in the lead, were determined to re-endow nature with an element of horror and inscrutability and to bring back a God who permitted evil as well as good\u2014in short, to give God back his thunder.\u201d\nIn Warren\u2019s work, especially his novels, there is a strong emphasis on what Walker refers to as \u201cthe vitality of Southern history.\u201d The critic continues, \u201c[Warren displays] a sense of ... history as a continuum in which he was himself involved. ... [He] has long since left Guthrie, Kentucky and the South, to live in the North. He has, nonetheless, remained a Southerner, and the eternal return has been as much a part of his own life as it is of the lives of his characters.\u201d Warren\u2019s subject matter, for example, is markedly regional; he drew much of his inspiration from personal reminiscences as well as from narratives, ballads, and folk legends he heard as a child in Kentucky and Tennessee.\nDespite his reliance on history for material, Warren balked at being labeled a \u201chistorical novelist.\u201d \u201cI just happened to encounter stories that had the right germ of an idea for a novel,\u201d he once stated in a Saturday Review article. \u201cI should hope that the historical novel would be a way of saying something about the present.\u201d To this end, he often changes the actual historical focus of a story to concentrate on peripheral characters whose behavior reveals more about the ethical or dramatic issues behind the facts. Therefore, maintain Everett Wilkie and Josephine Helterman in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Warren\u2019s \u201cmain obsession is knowledge,\u201d not history. Explain the critics: \u201cHis works reflect the many forms in which he himself has found knowledge. ... [His] wisdom is the wisdom of interpretation; his main question, \u2018How is one to look at life?\u2019 From an elaboration of the complex forces which shape both our lives and our perceptions, he shows us history as a living force which can yet tell us something about ourselves.\u201d\nFor Warren, this process of self-discovery was painful, yet the opposite state\u2014ignorance\u2014was brutish. In his book The Poetic Vision of Robert Penn Warren, Victor Strandberg declares that the contemplation of this passage from innocence to maturity is \u201cthe crucial center\u201d of Warren\u2019s career. With this theme in mind, writes Strandberg, Warren typically divides his characters into two groups: \u201cthose who refuse passage into a polluted and compromised adult environment\u201d (whom Strandberg refers to as the \u201cClean\u201d people) and \u201cthose who accept passage into the world\u2019s stew\u201d (the \u201cDirty\u201d people). The Clean people prefer to think of themselves as being separate from the filth and corruption of the world, while the Dirty people are willing to face life as it is in order \u201cto proceed to the subsequent stages of spiritual development.\u201d In Warren\u2019s view, the Clean people can either be relatively harmless, reclusive fundamentalist types, or they can be almost psychopathic in their determination to purify the world and punish sinners (i.e., the Dirty people). In all Warren\u2019s writing, the \u201cmost negative characters are those who reject the osmosis of being, while his spiritual guides are those who accept it,\u201d Strandberg observes.\nThe \u201caction\u201d in most of Warren\u2019s work thus consists primarily of an idealistic narrator\u2019s search for his or her identity in an atmosphere of confusion and/or corruption. This search eventually leads to recognition of the world\u2019s fallen state and, consequently, of the self\u2019s \u201cinnate depravity,\u201d to use Strandberg\u2019s phrase. In an attempt to overcome the sense of alienation caused by these \u201cwarring parts of the psyche,\u201d a typical Warren character undergoes a period of intense self-examination that ideally results in a near-religious experience of conversion, rebirth, and a mystical feeling of oneness with God. This in turn opens the door to further knowledge, not only about the self but about the world as well. Though the search for identity may not always end in success, notes Strandberg, \u201cthe craving to recreate that original felicity [that existed before the Fall] is one of mankind\u2019s deepest obsessions, in Warren\u2019s judgment.\u201d\nTherefore, as Wilkie interprets it, Warren\u2019s goal is \u201cto provide an overview of the human condition and to explicate, or mirror, the perplexities of existence in a world in which belief in God has faded. [He] characterizes himself as a \u2018yearner,\u2019 suggesting that although he does not believe in God, he does believe that man must work out his own code by which to interpret his life and the things around him. ... In his view, man must come face to face with a reality stripped of both God\u2019s benign or malevolent intentions and the Romantic\u2019s pathetic fallacy. Despite whatever difficulties man may face in his existence, Warren does not counsel despair or state that life is not worth living. ... It is essential, [he] asserts, to learn whatever answers one can. ... Though being alive may not always be easy and fun, Warren believes it is well worth the effort.\u201d\nMost observers find Warren\u2019s language, style, and tone to be perfectly suited to his subject matter. His language, for example, is a lyrical mixture of earthiness and elegance, of the folk speech of Kentucky and Tennessee and what James Dickey refers to in the Saturday Review as a \u201crather quaintly old-fangled scholastic vocabulary.\u201d Richard Jackson offers a similar description in the Michigan Quarterly Review: \u201c[Warren\u2019s] idiom ... is at once conversational and lyric, contemporary and historic, profane and sacred. It is a language in which he can slip easily from necessary precept to casual observation, cosmic vision to particular sighting.\u201d In a Sewanee Review article, Calvin Bedient notes that Warren\u2019s poetry is written \u201cin a genuinely expansive, passionate style. Look at its prose ease and rapidity oddly qualified by log-piling compounds, alliteration, successive stresses, and an occasional inversion something rough and serviceable as a horse-blanket yet fancy to\u2014and you wonder how he ever came up with it. It is excitingly massive and moulded and full of momentum. Echoes of Yeats and Auden still persist, but it is wonderfully peculiar, homemade.\u201d\nCharles H. Bohner is equally impressed by Warren\u2019s forceful and exuberant style. \u201cThere is about his art the prodigality of the writer who exercises his verbal gifts for the sheer magic of the effects he can produce,\u201d notes the critic in his book-length study of Warren. \u201c[His] language is robust and rhetorical. He likes his adjectives and nouns to go in pairs, reinforcing one another, begetting rhythm and resonance. When a comparison catches his fancy, his first metaphor is likely to suggest another, and he piles image on image as he warms to his task. ... About all of Warren\u2019s work there is a gusto and masculine force, a willingness to risk bathos and absurdity, reminiscent of the writer who, Warren has said, has had the greatest influence on his own work\u2014Shakespeare. ... He has always seemed driven to explore the boundaries of his art, to push the possibilities of his form to its outer limits.\u201d\nThough Warren drew extensively from his own past for the language, settings, and themes that appear in both his fiction and poetry, he approached all of this familiar material somewhat objectively and analytically, as if he were contemplating them from a distance, either far from home or, more frequently, much later in time. Warren\u2019s preoccupation with time and how the passage of years affects memory reveals itself in his extensive use of flashbacks to illustrate the often ironic nature of the relationship between the past and the present. Critics also find the abundance of background detail in his work to be evidence of his near-obsession with time. According to James H. Justus in the Sewanee Review, for instance, one of the hallmarks of Warren\u2019s prose is his practice of including \u201cperiods of closely observed details strung out in an evocative rhetoric which invites nostalgia for a specific time and place or which invokes awe for a mythic history that seems to explain national and even human urges.\u201d And as Paul West asserts in his book Robert Penn Warren, \u201c[No] writer has worked harder than Warren to substantiate narrative through close, doting observation of the physical, emotional world. He sees it, makes the page tremble with it. ... His \u2018texture of relations\u2019\u2014to his past, to his work, to familiars and strangers\u2014is something he fingers endlessly; and in the long run it is the feel, not the feel\u2019s meaning, that he communicates.\u201d\nDespite the fact that Warren is popularly known as the author of All the King\u2019s Men, a novel loosely based on the life of Louisianan politician Huey \u201cKingfish\u201d Long, he thought of himself primarily as a poet. \u201cI started as a poet and I will probably end as a poet,\u201d he once commented in the Sewanee Review. \u201cIf I had to choose between my novels and my Selected Poems, I would keep the Selected Poems as representing me more fully, my vision and my self.\u201d\nAfter emerging from a 10-year-long period of \u201cpoet\u2019s block\u201d in 1954, Warren devoted most of his creative energies to writing verse. Unlike his early (pre-1944) poetry, which sprang from either the contemplation of complex metaphysical concepts or the ballads and narratives native to his region, Warren\u2019s later poetry was inspired by a mood, a natural event, or a memory that often takes shape as \u201ca moralized anecdote,\u201d to use Warren\u2019s own words. It is a highly personal and often autobiographical (but by no means confessional) form of poetry. In fact, maintains Kramer, \u201c[Warren\u2019s] poetry is so unlike that of most other poets claiming our attention ... that it requires a certain adjustment of the eye and the ear, and of that other faculty\u2014call it the moral imagination\u2014to which Mr. Warren\u2019s verse speaks with so much urgency and that of so many other poets nowadays does not. We are a long way, in this poetry, from the verse snapshot and the campy valentine\u2014a long way, too, from the verse diaries, confessions and dirty laundry lists that have come to occupy such a large place in our poetic literature. ... [His] is a poetry haunted by the lusts and loves of the flesh, filled with dramatic incident, vivid landscapes and philosophical reflection\u2014a poetry of passion recollected in the tragic mode. It teems with experience, and with the lessons and losses of experience.\u201d\n\u201cWarren sees ... what few of us have seen,\u201d states David Bromwich in the Hudson Review. \u201cHis poems draw their sustenance from a world of buzzards and swamps and forests almost unscarred; of iron loyalties and sudden betrayals; of the aimless talk of old men, interrupted by a rifle shot, and followed by silence. It is a world in which everything may depend on a rattlesnake heard scuttling for its hole, or a hawk seen obliquely among the shadows.\u201d\nAs Bromwich and other critics make clear, the natural world plays a prominent role in Warren\u2019s poetry, providing him with much of his inspiration and imagery. But according to Wilkie in his Dictionary of Literary Biography essay, the poet\u2019s fascination with nature does not mean he believes man can turn to nature for answers to age-old questions about life and death. \u201cWarren argues repeatedly that the natural world is not a sympathetic or reliable guide to interpreting human life and that man\u2019s affairs are a matter of indifference to the rest of creation,\u201d asserts the critic. \u201cOnly man\u2019s pride or ignorance allows him to impute to the natural world any concern with his comings and goings.\u201d\nThough Warren did not deny that man is an integral part of nature, what he celebrated in his poetry was the trait that sets man apart from nature\u2014namely, his ability (and desire) to seek knowledge in his quest \u201cto make sense out of life.\u201d As a result, reports Peter Stitt in the Southern Review, \u201cWarren\u2019s poems are a resounding testament to man, to nature, and to poetry itself. ... Among contemporary poets, it has been Robert Penn Warren\u2019s task to discover how the void at man\u2019s heart may be filled. Though revolutionary for our age, Warren\u2019s answer places him at the heart of the great tradition in English and American poetry.\u201d\nIn a strictly artistic sense, too, Warren worked within this great tradition in English and American poetry. Strandberg explains, \u201cThrough a career that reaches back over a half century, encompassing schools of pre-Modern, Modern, and post-Modern aesthetics, [Warren] has displayed both growth and consistency in technical resources. With respect to the ageless elements of poetic technique\u2014command of metaphor, control of tone and diction, powers of organization, mastery of sound effects, and the like\u2014each phase of Warren\u2019s career has evinced a `morality of style\u2019 that is true to the classic standard.\u201d As Harold Bloom observes in the New Leader, \u201c[Warren] alone among living writers ranks with the foremost American poets of the century: Frost, Stevens, Hart Crane, Williams, Pound, Eliot. ... [He] is that rarest kind of major poet: he has never stopped developing from his origins up to his work-in-progress.\u201d Swan agrees, adding, \u201cThe progression is striking\u2014from the impersonal tone, inspired by Eliot, of the early poems ... to the more personal, more intense free-verse style that began with Promises: Poems, 1954\u20131956 ... to the majestic reverie of the late poems.\u201d\nWarren\u2019s later poetry is noted for its rambling conversational rhythm, due in part to what Edward L. Stewart refers to in the Washington Post Book World as its \u201cwide range of conventional but loose-limbed, free but masterfully controlled verse patterns.\u201d Warren favored very long and very short lines, the use of which creates an irregular meter and sentences that seem to wind down the page, \u201crun[ning] forward, as it were, into experience,\u201d says Bedient in Parnassus. The overall tone is one of reflection and meditation, though not in a passive sense, writes Alan Williamson, another Washington Post Book World critic. \u201cIn the whiplash of [Warren\u2019s] long line, the most ordinary syntax becomes tense, muscular, searching,\u201d comments Williamson. \u201cHis ear is formidable, though given to strong effects rather than graceful ones.\u201d The Times Literary Supplement\u2019s Jay Parini also finds that \u201cpower is the word that comes to mind\u201d when reading Warren\u2019s work\u2014power that is expressed in the \u201craw-boned, jagged quality\u201d of his verse.\nAccording to John Rees Moore of the Sewanee Review, these are the same features that make Warren\u2019s poetry stand out \u201cin sharp contrast to the jittery rhythms and fragmented images\u2014the reaching out for a style\u2014that are characteristic of much recent poetry. Not that wit, boldness, and even a certain nervous energy are missing but that Warren\u2019s poetic quest for identity has reached a stage where he is freer to disregard whatever is not of central interest to him and mull over with increased concentration whatever is.\u201d In short, notes Peter Clothier in the Los Angeles Times Book Review, \u201cin an age when the quick gratification of surface glitter often replaces slower pleasures of craft and care, Robert Penn Warren\u2019s poetry reminds us that the work of a master craftsman is literally irreplaceable. ... [His] is work of absolute formal and intellectual integrity.\u201d\nNot all reviewers agree that Warren\u2019s work deserves such unqualified praise. The focus of most of their criticism is on the author\u2019s attitude toward his material; though they acknowledge that Warren tackles unquestionably important themes, they believe his treatment of those themes borders on the bombastic. As Leslie Fiedler explains in a volume of his collected essays, a Warren poem can be \u201cbombastic in the technical sense of the word: [there is] a straining of language and tone toward a scream which can no longer be heard, the absolute cry of bafflement and pain. Such a tone becomes in Warren ... ridiculous on occasion, ridiculous whenever we lapse from total conviction.\u201d\nIn his book Contemporaries, Alfred Kazin points out that \u201call [of Warren\u2019s] work seems to deal with the Fall of Man. And if in reading [him] I have come to be more wary of his handling of this theme, it is because of the nostalgia it conveys, the strident impatient language with which it is expressed, the abstract use to which it is put. ... Warren tends to make rhetoric of his philosophy.\u201d Bedient expresses a similar thought in the Sewanee Review, commenting that Warren \u201cseems bitten by the Enormity of it all. He will have mystery.\u201d As a result, concludes Bedient, his philosophical musings are \u201csometimes truly awkward and sometimes pseudo-profound.\u201d\nA few reviewers attribute Warren\u2019s occasional awkwardness to the very quality that has made him such a noteworthy figure in American literature: his versatility. Eric Bentley, for one, speculates that Warren\u2019s dual role as both artist and critic hinders his ability to \u201csubmerge himself in the artist.\u201d Bentley continues in a Kenyon Review article: \u201cTrite as it is nowadays to stigmatize an author as a dual personality, I cannot help pointing to a duality in Warren that may well constitute his major problem: it is his combination of critical and creative power. I am far from suggesting that the critical and the creative are of their nature antithetic and I am fully ready to grant that what makes Warren remarkable among American writers is his double endowment. The problem lies precisely in his being so two-sidedly gifted; he evidently finds it endlessly difficult to combine his two sorts of awareness.\u201d\nNoting in the Virginia Quarterly Review that \u201cWarren has dedicated his career to proving the indivisibility of the critical and the creative imaginations,\u201d David M. Wyatt goes on to state that \u201cSuch a habit of mind stations Warren on the border between ... the artist who works from experience and the critic who works toward meaning. ... His works constantly talk about themselves. ... His characters are placed out of themselves, the bemused or obsessive spectators of their own wayward acts. ... [Warren] thus joins that central American tradition of speakers\u2014Emerson, Thoreau, Henry Adams, Norman Mailer\u2014who are not only the builders but the interpreters of their own designs.\u201d\nParnassus reviewer Rachel Hadas maintains that Warren\u2019s difficulties stem from \u201cnothing as simple as a lack of talent.\u201d Hadas explains, \u201cPart of the problem seems to be an inordinate ambition for grandeur; part is what feels to me like haste. If Warren were in less of a hurry to chronicle each dawn dream, birdsong, and memory as it occurred, a process of distillation just might be allowed to take place. Mostly, though, it\u2019s a matter of the poet\u2019s judgment of his own work. ... [Warren exhibits an] inability or unwillingness to recognize and settle for the nature of his particular genius. ... [He], has an imagination of generous proportions. It embraces history, human drama, perhaps above all the beauty of the natural world; it is capable at times of both beauty of form and splendor of color. ... But Warren cannot do everything well. He is not an original thinker or a visionary poet; in his handling of condensed lyric, as well as of abstraction, he can be embarrassingly inept.\u201d In effect, Bedient declares, also writing in Parnassus, \u201c[Warren] has failed to be ruthless toward himself, and his weaknesses loom oppressively in the reflected brilliance of his accomplishments.\u201d\nMany critics, of course, disagree with these evaluations of Warren\u2019s poetry. In another Parnassus article, for instance, Paul Mariani writes: \u201cI could quarrel with certain things in Warren I find alien to my own sense of poetics: a sometimes loose, rambling line, a nostalgia verging on obsession, a veering towards philosophical attitudinizing, the mask of the redneck that out-rednecks the redneck. But I would rather leave such critical caveats for others. There is enough [in his poetry] to praise, and I am thankful to have been given to drink, if not out of those too rare `great depths,\u2019 then at least from a spring sufficiently deep, sufficiently clear.\u201d\nMonroe K. Spears reports in the Sewanee Review that Warren\u2019s failings \u201care hard for me to specify; I find his attitudes and themes\u2014moral, psychological, and religious\u2014so congenial that it is difficult for me to regard the poetry with proper detachment. Sometimes the themes are perhaps a little too explicit, not very fully dramatized; and there is a danger in the fact that they are basically few, though combined and varied in many ways.\u201d Nevertheless, continues Spears, \u201cWarren\u2019s later poetry seems to me to embody most of the special virtues of \u2018open\u2019 poetry\u2014accessibility, immediate emotional involvement, wide appeal\u2014and to resist the temptations to formlessness and to moral exhibitionism, self-absorption, and sentimentality that are the chief liabilities of that school.\u201d\nEven Bentley admits that Warren, despite his faults, \u201cis worth a dozen petty perfectionists.\u201d And as poet and critic James Dickey observes in his book Babel to Byzantium, \u201cOpening a book of poems by Robert Penn Warren is like putting out the light of the sun, or like plunging into the labyrinth and feeling the thread break after the first corner is passed. One will never come out in the same Self as that in which one entered. When he is good, and often even when he is bad, you had as soon read Warren as live. He gives you the sense of poetry as a thing of final importance to life: as a way or form of life. ... Warren\u2019s verse is so deeply and compellingly linked to man\u2019s ageless, age-old drive toward self-discovery, self-determination, that it makes all discussion of line endings, metrical variants, and the rest of poetry\u2019s paraphernalia appear hopelessly beside the point.\u201d\nOne point critics do agree on, however, is the extraordinary nature of Warren\u2019s contribution to literature. In his critical study of the author, Bohner declares that \u201cno other American literary figure of the twentieth century has exhibited greater versatility than Robert Penn Warren. ... While arguments about his preeminence in any one field would be ultimately inconclusive, his total accomplishment ... surpasses that of any other living writer.\u201d Marshall Walker has similar words of praise for Warren in the London Magazine, calling him \u201cAmerica\u2019s most distinguished man of letters in the European sense of a writer involved with books and human kind and at ease in a variety of genres. ... The range of his achievement testifies to the scope and commitment of Warren\u2019s human sympathies. Each intellectual act, whether formally poem, novel, or one of the interviews with black leaders in Who Speaks for the Negro? is of the nature of a poem, according to his own definition of the poem as \u2018a way of getting your reality shaped a little better\u2019. ... Underlying the energy, even the violence that is part of Warren\u2019s metaphor of the world as well as of the world itself, is a concern to visualize the meaning of common experience and, without artistic concessions, to make this meaning available in a body of work which, with astonishing success, unites metaphysical and social themes in a single vision.\u201d\nWriting in the Saturday Review, Dickey suggests Warren\u2019s depth rather than his range should be celebrated. \u201c[Warren] is direct, scathingly honest, and totally serious about what he feels,\u201d Dickey begins. \u201cHe plunges as though compulsively into the largest of subjects: those that seem to cry out for capitalization and afflatus and, more often than not in the work of many poets, achieve only the former. ... He is a poet of enormous courage, with a highly individual intelligence.\u201d But above all, concludes Dickey, Robert Penn Warren \u201clooks, and refuses to look away. ... [He] wounds deeply; he strikes in at blood-level and gut-level, with all the force and authority of time, darkness, and distance themselves, and of the Nothingness beyond nothingness, which may even be God.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"], "School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
