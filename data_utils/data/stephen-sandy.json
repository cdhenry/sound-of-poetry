Of Weathers Permitting (2005), John Hollander commented that \u201cthroughout this book rural matters are considered with a profound, rather than a light, urbanity\u2014an urbanity of intellect and diction and authoritative rhythmic control.\u201d\u00a0In his eight-part Surface Impressions, A Poem (2002), Sandy addresses the family, American history, faith, ecology, and technological change. In a review, poet and critic Peter Campion observed that \u201cwith concision and vivacity he portrays how emotions and thoughts collide with the sheer material of the world. ... Sandy has a unique gift for getting one image to segue into another with a fluid sharpness that any cinematographer would envy.\u201d\n\r\nSandy traveled to Japan on a Fulbright Visiting Lectureship and\u00a0was honored with fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Vermont Council on the Arts, and the Ingram Merrill Foundation. He translated ancient Greek poets,\u00a0taught at Harvard University, Brown University, and for many years at Bennington College, and\u00a0was the poet featured in the documentary The Biologist, the Poet and the Funeral Director (2007,\u00a0directed by Harvey Edwards). He died in 2016.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
