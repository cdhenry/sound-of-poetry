Her poems have appeared in The New Republic, Iowa Review, AGNI, Georgia Review, Indiana Review, and other journals. Her first collection of poetry is Zero at the Bone (2009). Her recent book is\u00a0Culinary Poetics and Edible Images in Twentieth-Century American Literature\u00a0(2018).\nThe voice in Cassarino\u2019s lyric poems is both familiar and solitary as it explores urban and natural landscapes as well as the complications of human entanglements. Poet Ron Slate, reviewing Zero at the Bone on his website, observed: \u201cOften her speaker observes herself in memory, moving through a landscape, carrying a dayload of uncertainty, testing the validity of her emotions.\u201d\u00a0\nZero at the Bone won the Lambda Literary Award in Poetry (2010) and the Audre Lorde Award. Cassarino received the 2007 Astraea Writers Fund Award in Poetry, and the \u201cDiscovery\u201d/The Nation Joan Leiman Jacobsen Poetry Prize in 2005. She has been nominated for the Rona Jaffe Writers\u2019 Award and twice for the Pushcart Prize.\nCassarino has taught at UCLA and Pratt, and currently teaches at Middlebury College.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
