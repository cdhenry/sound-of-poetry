The school of literary criticism known as New Criticism gained important support from Empson\u2019s\u00a0Seven Types of Ambiguity: A Study of Its Effects on English Verse.\u00a0This work, together with his other published essays, has become \u201cpart of the furniture of any good English or American critic\u2019s mind,\u201d G.S. Fraser remarks in\u00a0Great Writers of the English Language: Poets.\u00a0Empson will also be remembered for \u201cthe peculiar, utterly original and startling tenor of his works,\u201d says the\u00a0Times\u00a0writer. Radically different from the romantic poetry produced by\u00a0Dylan Thomas\u00a0and Empson\u2019s other peers, Empson\u2019s poetry employed a more objective, nonsentimental language that reflected his competence as a mathematician and his reverence for science. The\u00a0Times\u00a0article relates that his first collection,\u00a0Poems, \u201cmade an immediate deserved and explosive impact such as the literary scene in Britain knows only two or three times in a century.\u201d Empson was also a legendary professor of English literature at Sheffield University, where he taught for nearly 20 years.\n\r\nJohn Gross of the\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0relates, \u201cAn essentially positive critic, [Empson] had the gift of being able to show you qualities in a work you would never have seen without him, and the even more important gift of enlarging your imagination, encouraging you to go on looking for yourself.\u201d This new approach to poetry appreciation centered on the reader\u2019s close attention to the properties of poetic language opened up a new field of literary criticism\u2014a remarkable accomplishment, considering that Empson did so without proposing to alter previous methods of criticism; neither did he revise the standards by which literature is traditionally judged, nor did he invent new ways to reclassify well-known works of literature, Hugh Kenner points out in\u00a0Gnomon: Essays on Contemporary Literature.\u00a0Empson\u2019s explanations of how meaning is carried in poetic language have made poetry accessible to hundreds of readers, Kenner observes.\n\r\nPerhaps most helpful to erstwhile readers of poetry is Empson\u2019s first book-length work of criticism,\u00a0Seven Types of Ambiguity.\u00a0In general usage, a word or reference is deemed ambiguous if it has more than one possible meaning. In\u00a0Seven Types,\u00a0Empson wrote, \u201cI propose to use the word in an extended sense, and shall think relevant to my subject any verbal nuance, however slight, which gives room for alternative reactions to the same piece of language.\u201d Empson\u2019s seven types are briefly defined in the table of contents: \u201cFirst-type ambiguities arise when a detail is effective in several ways at once \u2026 In second-type ambiguities two or more alternative meanings are fully resolved into one . \u2026 The condition for the third type ambiguity is that two apparently unconnected meanings are given simultaneously. \u2026 In the fourth type the alternative meanings combine to make clear a complicated state of mind in the author. \u2026 The fifth type is a fortunate confusion, as when the author is discovering his idea in the act of writing \u2026 or not holding it in mind all at once. \u2026 In the sixth type what is said is contradictory or irrelevant and the reader is forced to invent interpretations. \u2026 The seventh type is that of full contradiction, marking a division in the author\u2019s mind.\u201d\n\r\nAmbiguity impedes communication when it results from the writer\u2019s indecision, Empson wrote in\u00a0Seven Types: \u201cIt is not to be respected in so far as it is due to weakness or thinness of thought, obscures the matter at hand unnecessarily\u2026 or when the interest of the passage is not focussed upon it, so that it is merely an opportunism in the handling of the material, if the reader will not understand the ideas which are being shuffled, and will be given a general impression of incoherence.\u201d However, the protean properties of words\u2014their ability to carry multiple meanings in a variety of ways\u2014are a major component of poetic language, and being aware of how this facet of language operates is one of the pleasures of poetry, said Empson. \u201cSeven Types\u00a0is primarily an exercise intended to help the reader who has already felt the pleasure understand the nature of his response,\u201d a\u00a0Contemporary Literary Critics\u00a0contributor suggests.\n\r\n\u201cSome of Empson\u2019s early critics felt that he had simply written himself a license to search for multiple meanings with no awareness of the controlling context in which the local ambiguity appears,\u201d reports the same contributor. On the contrary, Empson guides critics to consider \u201cpurpose, context and person\u201d in addition to \u201cthe critical principles of the author and of the public he is writing for\u201d when explicating meaning.\u00a0Hudson Review\u00a0contributor Roger Sale believes that the book has been too harshly judged in many reviews. He writes, \u201cMost discussions have picked on its least interesting aspects, its use of the word \u2018ambiguity\u2019 and its ranging of the \u2018types\u2019 along a scale of \u2018advancing logical disorder.\u2019 But these matters are really minor. \u2026 The book, [Empson] says, is not philosophical but literary, and its aim is to examine lines Empson finds beautiful and haunting. \u2026 But in at least fifteen places Empson shows that the aim of analysis is not so much understanding lines as uncovering whole tracts of the mind, and the book is studded with the right things said about a poet or an historical period.\u201d In fact, concludes Robert M. Adams in the\u00a0New York Review of Books, \u201cAlready certain passages of Empsonian exegesis.\u00a0 \u2026 have attained classic status, so that the text can't be intelligently considered without them.\u00a0 \u2026 I think he had, though in lesser measure, Dr. Johnson\u2019s extraordinary gift for laying his finger on crucial literary moments; and that alone is likely to ensure him a measure of permanence.\u201d\n\nSome Versions of Pastoral\u00a0addresses the modern propensity to express nostalgia for idyllic world views that belong to the past. According to Empson, pastoral literature implied \u201ca beautiful relation between rich and poor [and made] \u2026 simple people express strong feelings \u2026 in learned and fashionable language (so that you wrote about the best subject in the best way).\u201d Empson maintains that contemporary expressions of the pastoral are for the most part pretenses: \u201cin pastoral you take a limited life and pretend it is the full and normal one.\u201d Writing in\u00a0Modern Heroism: Essays on D.H. Lawrence, William Empson, and J.R.R. Tolkien,\u00a0Sale contends that by examining a series of leader/ heroes from the 16th century forward, Empson means to say that the moieties that used to bind leaders to their people no longer exist\u2014in Sales\u2019s words, \u201cthe people have become a mob and the hero painfully alienated\u201d\u2014and that, therefore, the role of hero or Christ-figure is not attainable.\n\r\nSale believes that\u00a0Some Versions of Pastoral\u00a0is Empson\u2019s best book, although it too has been misjudged as a literary work and misused as a critical tool. Sale notes that \u201cin [this book] he can move from the work at hand to his vision with almost no shoving of the evidence, so even though his prose and organization may seem difficult on first reading, he turns with almost indescribable grace from the smallest particular to the largest generalization and then back to various middle grounds. When one becomes used to the book and begins to hear the massive chords of its orchestrations supporting even the most irrelevant aside, the effect is one only the greatest books can produce\u2014it envelopes and controls such large areas of the imagination that for a while one is willing to admit it is the only book ever written. As a modern work of persuasion it is unrivaled.\u201d\n\nMilton\u2019s God\u00a0is \u201ca diatribe against Christianity which Empson feels has had a monopoly on torture-worship, sexual repression and hypocrisy,\u201d the\u00a0Contemporary Literary Critics\u00a0essayist writes. Milton\u2019s God, Empson maintains, seems to want to set aside the cruelty of his absolute rule, and \u201chas cut out of Christianity both the torture-horror and the sex-horror, and after that the monster seems almost decent.\u201d Questioning Milton\u2019s orthodoxy on these grounds, Empson presents Milton as a humanist\u2014a view that raised a \u201cfuror\u201d among the \u201centrenched Miltonic establishment,\u201d says Adams. It was, he says, the eccentric professor\u2019s \u201clast raid on the academic chicken coop\u201d before his retirement from the University of Sheffield in 1971.\n\r\nEmpson\u2019s own humanism accounts in part for his open-minded approach to the topic of meaning in literature. Kenner notes: \u201c'The object of life, after all,' [Empson] tells us late in\u00a0Ambiguity,\u00a0\u2018is not to understand things, but to maintain one\u2019s defenses and equilibrium and live as well as one can; it is not only maiden aunts who are placed like this.\u2019\u201d In\u00a0Milton\u2019s God,\u00a0he declared his agreement with philosopher Jeremy Bentham \u201cthat the satisfaction of any impulse is in itself an elementary good, and that the practical ethical question is how to satisfy the greatest number.\u201d Empson\u2019s poetry and criticism are the natural extensions of his views. Empson offers \u201cnot a theory of literature or a single method of analysis but a model of how to read with pleasure and knowledge,\u201d notes\u00a0New Statesman\u00a0reviewer Jon Cook. In\u00a0Using Biography,\u00a0for example, he demonstrates how familiarity with an author\u2019s life helps the critic to empathize with the author, allowing the critic to apply corresponding personal experiences to see into an author\u2019s intentions. The resulting insights on\u00a0Andrew Marvell\u00a0and\u00a0W.B. Yeats, says\u00a0James Fenton\u00a0in the London\u00a0Times,\u00a0owe more to Empson\u2019s speculations and free associations than to systematic analysis of biographical detail. According to Cook, Empson makes it clear that it is far worse to succumb to \u201cthe critical habit of pressing literary works into the service of authoritarian and repressive ideologies, all this, of course, under the comforting guise that to receive authority in this way does us good.\u201d\n\r\nEven after his death in 1984 Empson\u2019s ideas continued to impact the field of literary criticism, as several of his unfinished, uncollected, or unpublished writings were posthumously published. These include\u00a0Argufying: Essays on Literature and Culture,\u00a0Faustus and the Censor,\u00a0and the two-volume\u00a0Essays on Renaissance Literature.\u00a0A collection of previously published reviews and essays,\u00a0Argufying\u00a0is divided into five sections, covering such topics as poetry, fiction, and cultural perspectives. Much of the collection is taken up with Empson\u2019s verbal sparring with fellow critics, prompting Miller to comment on \u201cthe imminently polemical tone with which Empson pursues even the friendliest review or comment.\u201d Faustus and the Censor\u00a0is a critical study of\u00a0Christopher Marlowe\u2019s\u00a0Dr. Faustus.\n\r\nEmpson\u2019s two-volume\u00a0Essays on Renaissance Literature,\u00a0like\u00a0Argufying,\u00a0was edited by his authorized biographer, John Haffenden. Volume 1,\u00a0Donne and the New Philosophy,\u00a0is a collection of essays about the man whose poetry greatly influenced Empson. Volume 2 includes miscellaneous essays focusing on Shakespeare\u2019s\u00a0A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u00a0as well as a host of other Renaissance writers including Christopher Marlowe and\u00a0Ben Jonson. \u201cEmpson was a true miracle-worker in his criticism; he made the dead live again and gave the silenced speech. Fielding comes alive when Empson writes about him, as Donne\u2019s poems do under the critic\u2019s deftly charitable hands,\u201d notes Eric Griffiths in a\u00a0Times Literary Supplement\u00a0review of Volume 1. Stephen Greenblatt, however, reviewing Volume 2 in the\u00a0London Review of Books,\u00a0argues that \u201cNone of this is close to the level of Empson\u2019s major work.\u201d While Charles Rosen, writing in the\u00a0New York Review of Books,\u00a0admits that Empson was \u201cwrong \u2026 often enough\u201d as a critic, he contends that \u201cEmpson\u2019s achievement here as elsewhere comes from the generosity of spirit which made him consistently a great critic.\"\n\r\nAlthough Empson is best known for his criticism,\u00a0Preliminary Essays\u00a0author John Wain writes: \u201cIt may well be that criticism will be read and remembered while poetry is forgotten, for criticism breeds fresh criticism more easily than poetry breeds fresh poetry; but in Empson\u2019s case it would be a pity if he were known simply as the \u2018ambiguity\u2019 man, and not as a poet.\u201d A. Alvarez writes in\u00a0Stewards of Excellence, \u201cThe poetry of William Empson has been more used [as a model] than that of any other English poet of our time.\u201d As the upheavals of World War II threatened to render romanticism and pastoralism obsolete, poets were challenged to find language and forms equal to the age. \u201cEmpson\u2019s verse was read with an overwhelming sense of relief after the brash and embarrassed incoherence of wartime and post-war poetry,\u201d notes Alvarez, who elaborates, \u201cthere is something in his work which encourages other writers to use it for their own ends. It has, I think, an\u00a0essential\u00a0objectivity. \u2026 In the later poems what goes in as strong personal feeling comes out as something more general; whilst in the earlier work all the personal energy goes into a particularly impersonal business.\u201d\n\r\nIn addition, Empson\u2019s best verses \u201chave a quality of mystery and incantation which runs quite counter to his professed rationalism,\u201d notes Robert Nye in the London\u00a0Times.\u00a0The poems, says a writer for the London\u00a0Times,\u00a0were perceived by some critics to be like \u201cexercises: ingenious, resembling staggeringly clever crossword puzzles, abstruse, riddling\u2014in a word, over-intellectual. But as\u00a0Edwin Muir\u00a0and other shrewder readers noted, their real keynote was passion. They represent, as Empson put it in one of the most famous of them, a style learned from a despair. The subject matter of the great ones \u2026 is the nature of sexual passion and the nature of political passion.\u201d Writers found in Empson\u2019s verse the balance between intense emotion and detachment that seemed appropriate to describe life in the contemporary world.\n\r\nAlvarez believes that Empson\u2019s poetry depends on his control over a large range of ideas: \u201c[Empson] is less interested in saying his own say than in the agility and skill and variety with which he juggles his ideas. So it is a personal poem only at a remove: the subject is impersonal; the involvement is all his effort to make as much as he can out of the subject, and in the accomplishment with which he relates his manifold themes so elegantly together. Empson\u2019s, in short, is a poetry of wit in the most traditional sense. \u2026 And, like most wit, the pleasure it gives is largely in the immaculate performance, which is a rare pleasure but a limited one.\u201d\n\r\nIn tracing the development of Empson\u2019s poetry, Alvarez says of the early poems: \u201cIn his sardonic way, Empson made his polish and inventiveness seem like a personal claim for sanity, as though he saw everything in a fourth and horrifying dimension but was too well-mannered to say so. Hence the wry despair and vigorous stylishness seemed not at all contradictory.\u201d He notes that \u201cIt is as a stylist of poetry and ideas that, I think, Empson is most important. He took over all [T.S.] Eliot\u2019s hints about what was most significant in the English tradition, and he put them into practice without any of the techniques Eliot had derived from the French and Italians. And so his poetry shows powerfully and with great purity the perennial vitality of the English tradition; and in showing this it also expresses the vitality and excitement of the extraordinarily creative moment when Empson began writing.\u201d\n\r\nWhile Empson focused on poetry when he was not writing criticism, he did attempt several fictional works during his lifetime.\u00a0The Royal Beasts and Other Works,\u00a0edited by Haffenden, collects several of Empson\u2019s unpublished fictional works, and includes poems, a satirical fable, and the outline for a ballet. The title of the collection comes from Empson\u2019s fable,\u00a0The Royal Beasts,\u00a0written while Empson was teaching in China in 1937. This work \u201cexplores the possibility of a race of apelike creatures, the Wurroos, who by a quirk of evolution evolved rational capacities of thought,\u201d notes Tyrus Miller in\u00a0Modern Language Notes.\u00a0The ballet sketch, also inspired by Empson\u2019s stint in the Far East, examines both Eastern and Western religious myths.\n\r\nBefore his death, Empson was knighted by Queen Elizabeth. His most-lasting legacy will likely be as a critic. \u201cEmpson\u2019s critical achievement has nothing to do with paralysing theories,\u201d wrote Jim McCue in\u00a0Agenda. \u201cIt is an empirical investigation of how to read, think and perhaps live better.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
