He was born in Warsaw, Poland in or around 1891, but soon afterward his family moved to St. Petersburg, Russia. In St. Petersburg, the Jewish Mandelstams\u2014on the strength, according to some critics, of the father\u2019s fine standing as a leather merchant\u2014managed to live relatively free of the anti-Semitic hostilities which were then pervasive. Mandelstam eventually studied at the city\u2019s prestigious Tenishev School, but he failed to distinguish himself. Continuing his education abroad, he attended both the Sorbonne in Paris and the University of Heidelberg in Germany. After returning home Mandelstam\u2014despite his Jewish ancestry and his somewhat unimpressive record at Tenishev\u2014gained acceptance to the University of St. Petersburg, a rather exclusive, and exclusively Christian, institution.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBy this time, the early 1910s, Mandelstam had already forsaken his actual studies in favor of writing, and he had begun contributing verse to\u00a0Apollon,\u00a0St. Petersburg\u2019s leading literary journal. In 1913 he published his first verse collection,\u00a0Kamen\u2014translated as\u00a0Stone,\u00a0which immediately established him in the upper echelon of Russian poets. During the era when\u00a0Stone\u00a0was first published, symbolism was the dominant form of poetic expression among Russian poets. Mandelstam, however, renounced the symbolist style and its metaphysical, even occult aspects. His own poems were direct expressions of thoughts, feelings, and observations. As such, Mandelstam ranked as an Acmeist, which is to say that his poems were acknowledged to be rooted in intuition and a humanist perspective. Appropriately enough, Mandelstam himself described his Acmeist style as \u201corganic.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nUnfortunately for Mandelstam, the 1910s were hardly a prosperous decade for establishing one\u2019s self as a poet in Russia. World War I was no sooner at an end than Russia erupted into revolution. The Bolsheviks, who were themselves divided, assumed control of the country and soon began bending art\u2014and, thus, artists\u2014to propagandist ends. For Mandelstam, who had supported the Bolsheviks, the appropriation of his poetry to a political cause, even one that presumed to advocate the greater good of the common people, proved untenable. Far from applying his poetry to the political ends recommended by Russia\u2019s governing body, Mandelstam persisted in writing poetry that promoted his own humanism, which was at once profound yet personal. Consequently, he soon become the subject of reproach from those artists and intellectuals who had willingly compromised themselves.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn the 1920s, as the Bolsheviks established their communist state of the Soviet Union, it became increasingly difficult for the nonconformist Mandelstam to maintain himself as a poet. He unabashedly refused to yield his art to political aims. Indeed, Mandelstam chose instead to emphasize his autonomy as an artist. In 1922, as the Bolsheviks began to exert increasing control over Russian artists, Mandelstam published\u00a0Tristia,\u00a0a collection that implicitly celebrates the individual over the masses and love over comradeship. These poems, far from affirming the ideals of the state, revel in the personal, even the painful. \u201cCome back to me,\u201d writes Mandelstam in an untitled poem (as translated by Clarence Brown and W.S. Merwin in\u00a0Selected Poems), \u201cI\u2019m frightened without you. / Never had you such power / over me as now. /Everything I desire / appears to me. / I\u2019m not jealous any more. / I\u2019m calling you.\u201d It is clear from the poems in\u00a0Tristia\u00a0that in this period of apocalyptic upheaval [Mandelstam\u2019s] main concern is with art, poetry, the word,\u201d observed Nils Ake Nilsson in\u00a0Scando-Slavica.\u00a0\u201cThe question he puts to himself is: will poetry survive?\u201d\nTristia\u00a0contributed to Mandelstam\u2019s further alienation from his country\u2019s pro-state artists and intellectuals. Among peers who had willingly compromised their art for the communists, Mandelstam was reviled as a subversive and, thus, a threat to the well-being of the new communist state, which ostensibly emphasized the collective over the individual. Other artists who had adopted the same defiant stance as Mandelstam had already fallen victim to the vindictive communists. Notable among these figures is Nikolay Gumilev, who was generally recognized as the leader of the Acmeist poets. Gumilev\u2014who had been married to Anna Akhmatova, considered by some scholars Russia\u2019s greatest poet of the times\u2014had already been executed by 1921, the year before\u00a0Tristia\u00a0first appeared in print.\nMandelstam likewise became the victim of recriminations from the newly empowered communists. He found it increasingly difficult to publish his poems in literary journals and eventually resorted to writing children\u2019s books as a means of supporting himself. But in 1925, despite considerable adversity, Mandelstam published\u00a0The Noise of Time,\u00a0a collection of autobiographical accounts. Donald Rayfield, in his introduction to\u00a0The Eyesight of Wasps: Poems,\u00a0a collection of Mandelstam\u2019s poems translated by James Greene, described\u00a0The Noise of Time\u00a0as \u201ca haunting evocation of the cultural influences ... on the adolescent [Mandelstam].\u201d Such personal writings, however, probably did little to endear Mandelstam to authorities eager to promote more political works explicitly supportive of the Soviet leadership\u2019s\u2014 that is, dictator Joseph Stalin\u2019s\u2014own aims.\nIn 1928 Mandelstam, despite continued antagonism from state officials, managed to produce three more volumes:\u00a0The Egyptian Stamp,\u00a0a surreal novella about the sufferings of a Russian Jew;\u00a0Poems,\u00a0another verse collection, one that marked Mandelstam\u2019s continued maturation as a poet; and\u00a0On Poetry,\u00a0a collection of critical essays.\u00a0The Egyptian Stamp,\u00a0commented Clarence Brown in\u00a0Slavic and East European Journal,\u00a0is \u201cthe single example of Mandelstam\u2019s narrative prose and one of the few examples of surrealist fiction to be found in all of Russian literature.\u201d\nThat Mandelstam managed to publish the three works of 1928 has been attributed, at least in part, to the political maneuverings of Nikolay Bukharin, a poetry enthusiast prominent in communist dictator Joseph Stalin\u2019s ruling circle. That same year, Mandelstam was accused of stealing credit after a publication mistakenly listed him as a translator instead of as an editor. With considerable guidance from the state, the press mounted a campaign against Mandelstam. Fearing that such allegations would result in his being banned from publishing, Mandelstam vehemently denied the charges. His actions, however, only served to fuel the press\u2019s activities and the public\u2019s interest. Finally, Bukharin interceded and managed to have Mandelstam and Nadezhda Khazina, Mandelstam\u2019s wife of seven years, sent to Armenia as journalists.\nBukharin\u2019s ploy proved effective in that it removed Mandelstam from the center of controversy. But when Mandelstam returned in 1930, he again became the target of persecution from the communists. The state\u2019s repressive ways with nonconformist poets continued to exact a heavy price: Akhmatova, for instance, chose to withdraw her work from consideration for publication. Another poet, Vladimir Mayakovsky, made a more extreme choice: suicide.\nLike fellow poet Boris Pasternak, Mandelstam eventually withdrew from poetry and began expressing himself in prose. He published\u00a0Journey to Armenia,\u00a0an account of his experiences there. D.M. Thomas noted in the\u00a0Times Literary Supplement\u00a0that\u00a0Journey to Armenia\u00a0is \u201cas allusive and charged with daring metaphor as [Mandelstam\u2019s] poetry.\u201d The volume failed to find favor with the Soviet authorities, who removed its editor from the work force.\nAfter publishing\u00a0Journey to Armenia,\u00a0Mandelstam found life at home to be even more trying than before. Although banned from publishing, he continued to write. He returned to poetry, and in his work from this period, the early 1930s, he began to acknowledge the sense that he was, in effect, doomed. In\u00a0Selected Poems,\u00a0translators Brown and Merwin provide this translation from \u201cTo Anna Akhmatova\u201d: \u201cO ancient headsman\u2019s blocks, keep on loving me! / Players in the garden seem to aim at death, and hit nine-pins. / I walk through my life aiming like that, in my iron shirt / (why not?) and I\u2019ll find an old beheading axe in the woods.\u201d\nMandelstam exacerbated his own demise when he wrote, in 1933, a poem characterizing Stalin as a gleeful killer. Brown and Merwin, in\u00a0Selected Poems,\u00a0present a translation of this poem, which concludes: \u201cHe rolls the executions on his tongue like berries. / He wishes he could hug them like big friends from home.\u201d After news of this poem reached the Soviet leadership, Mandelstam was arrested. He was tortured both psychologically and physically, and it was assumed that he would eventually be executed. But once again Bukharin managed to intercede, this time having Mandelstam spared and consigned to a village in the Ural Mountains. During this period, Stalin undertook a series of murderous purges that rid the Soviet Union of countless citizens. No one, it seems, was safe. Even prominent party officials were executed.\nIn exile, Mandelstam lived fearing that the Soviets were not yet done with him. He grew mad from the horrific tortures he had already endured, and he eventually attempted suicide. Through the ministrations of his wife, Mandelstam stabilized sufficiently to continue with his poetry. By this time he was fearless in depicting his hardships and writing of the crazed Stalin. An untitled poem from 1937, as translated by James Greene in\u00a0The Eyesight of Wasps,\u00a0reads: \u201cThe eyes of the unskilled earth shall shine / And like a ripe thunderstorm Lenin shall burst out, / But on this earth (which shall escape decay) / There to murder life and reason\u2014Stalin.\u201d\nAfter Mandelstam\u2019s exile ended in 1937, he traveled to Moscow, where he had presumed that he still owned a home. The state, however, had seized Mandelstam\u2019s quarters. Throughout the next year, Mandelstam and his wife lived a threadbare existence, and his health deteriorated to the extent that he suffered two heart attacks. During this period, Stalin undertook another series of purges to rid the Soviet Union of what he considered to be undesirable elements. While recuperating at a sanatorium, Mandelstam was once again arrested. This time he disappeared into the maze of Soviet work camps and prisons. In late 1938, the government reported that he had died of heart failure.\n\r\nIn the years since his death, Mandelstam has come to be recognized\u2014particularly in the West\u2014as one of the Russian language\u2019s greatest and most inspiring poets, the equal to Akhmatova, Pasternak, and Marina Tsvetaeva. While Mandelstam\u2019s work received little attention in the Soviet Union, particularly during the Cold War, it gained widespread attention in the West, and has been published in many translated collections. These volumes serve to affirm the integrity of Mandelstam\u2019s artistry and his spirit. As Ervin C. Brody wrote in his introduction to\u00a0Poems from Mandelstam,\u00a0a collection translated by R.H. Morrison: \u201cNo Soviet poet of modern sensibility reflected so intensively as Mandelstam the loss of historical and philosophical self-assurance and the emerging discrepancies between state order and the isolation of individual consciousness. ... He was chiefly concerned with the preservation of Russia\u2019s cultural and moral heritage, and his best poetry attests to the survival of art and consciousness ... at a time and place when both seemed to have the flimsiest of chances to stay alive.\u201d\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Russia"]}}
