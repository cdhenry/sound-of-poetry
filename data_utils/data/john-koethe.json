Koethe began writing poetry as an undergraduate at Princeton University and earned his PhD from Harvard University.\n\r\nCritic Andrew Yaphe calls Koethe \u201cone of our foremost Romantic poets, an inheritor of the tradition of Stevens and Ashbery.\u201d Koethe\u2019s longer poems, occasionally formal or metered, show the influence of Elizabeth Bishop, William Wordsworth, Marcel Proust, Mark Strand, and Kenneth Koch. He regards his poetry \u201cas music and I think of it in terms of movements and sounds and the way it flows rather than content.\u201d As critic Robert Hahn notes, \u201cKoethe\u2019s poetry is ultimately lyrical, and its claim on us comes not from philosophy\u2019s dream of precision but from the common human dream that our lives make some kind of sense. What Koethe offers is not ideas but a weave of reflection, emotion, and music; what he creates is art\u2014a bleak, harrowing art in all it chooses to confront, but one whose rituals and repetitions contain the hope of renewal.\u201d\n\r\nKoethe received the Kingsley Tufts Award for Falling Water (1997), the Frank O\u2019Hara Award for Domes (1973), and the Bernard F. Connors Award. His poetry has been included in several anthologies, including Best American Poetry. He has been granted fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also received a lifetime achievement award from the Council for Wisconsin Writers. He is professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
