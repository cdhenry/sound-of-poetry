He contracted polio when he was six years old; the disease left him paralyzed from the neck down, and he used an iron lung to breathe. He earned a BA and an MA from the University of California\u2013Berkeley. An advocate of independent living for disabled people, O\u2019Brien was a frequent contributor to newspapers, writing columns on such topics as sports, religion, and disability issues. In 1997, he cofounded Lemonade Factory, a press that publishes work by people who have disabilities. His books include the memoir How I Became a Human Being: A Disabled Man\u2019s Quest for Independence (2003) and the poetry collections The Man in the Iron Lung (1997) and Breathing (1998), among others. \u00a0 A documentary about O\u2019Brien\u2019s life, Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark O\u2019Brien (1996), won an Academy Award. His column \u201cOn Seeing a Sex Surrogate\u201d inspired another movie about his life, The Sessions (2012), starring John Hawkes and Helen Hunt. O\u2019Brien died in 1999 of complications from bronchitis.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
