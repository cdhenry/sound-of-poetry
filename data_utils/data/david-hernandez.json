He is the author of several collections of poetry, including Dear Sincerely (2016),\u00a0Hoodwinked (2011), Always Danger (2006), and A House Waiting for Music (2003), as well as the young adult novels No More Us for You (2009) and Suckerpunch (2007). With humor and precision, Hernandez\u2019s poems investigate the ordinary as it reckons with loss. In her review of Hoodwinked, Debrah Lechner noted that \u201cThe vast majority of images in the poems of Hoodwinked are of everyday life, an ordinary, common life filled with ordinary beauty and common events; but the repeated theme of death and decay draw these images into magnified, sharp focus.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nHernandez\u2019s honors include a 2011 Literary Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts and a grant from the Ludwig Vogelstein Foundation. He has taught at the University of California-Irvine, Antioch University, and California State University-Long Beach. He and his wife, writer Lisa Glatt, live in Long Beach, California.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
