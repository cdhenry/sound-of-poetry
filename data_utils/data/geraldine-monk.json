Over this period her poetry has constantly evolved but her\u00a0preoccupation with what she calls \u201cthe emotional geography of place\u201d\u00a0has remained a central concern, especially in relation to historical events and narratives such as the trial of the Pendle Witches and the imprisonment of Mary Queen of Scots. \u00a0\nMonk's poetry collections include\u00a0Interregnum (Creation Books, 1994),\u00a0Escafeld Hangings\u00a0(West House Books, 2005),\u00a0Ghost &\u00a0Other Sonnets\u00a0(Salt Publishing, 2008),\u00a0Lobe Scarps & Finials\u00a0(Leafe Press, 2011), and\u00a0They Who Saw the\u00a0Deep\u00a0(Free Verse Editions/Parlor Press,\u00a02016). She edited\u00a0Cusp: Recollections\u00a0of Poetry in Transition\u00a0(Shearsman Books, 2012).\u00a0Monk has been the recipient of many grants and awards as well as commissions.\u00a0\u201cHidden Cities,\u201d\u00a0a poetic text for bus tours of English cities\u00a0commissioned by Ruskin School of Fine Art, Oxford University, has become one of her most quoted and widely discussed pieces. \u201cThe Three Stepping Stones of Dawn\u201d\u00a0was her most recent commission for the BBC\u2019s Dawn Chorus events\u00a0broadcast in May 2016.\nCritical studies of Monk's poetry have been conducted in several books,\u00a0including Linda A. Kinnahan\u2019s Lyric Interventions, Zo\u0451 Skoulding\u2019s Experimental Cities, and David and Christine Kennedy\u2019s Body, Time & Locale, and The Salt Companion to Geraldine Monk (edited by Scott Thurston), and Adam Piette's article\u00a0\u201cPolaroidy: The Revels of Geraldine Monk.\u201d\nMonk runs West House Books with her husband, the poet Alan Halsey. They are frequent visitors to the U.S. where they have read extensively over the last 20 years and are regular visiting poets at SUNY Buffalo and Boise State University.\u00a0She is an affiliated poet at the Centre for Poetry and Poetics, Sheffield University.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
