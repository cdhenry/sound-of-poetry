He dropped out of high school while still a teenager and joined the army to serve in the Korea war. Wounded by shrapnel during the conflict, he returned to civilian life with an injury that led to drug addiction. Knight was convicted of robbery in 1960 and served eight years in the Indiana State Prison. According to Terrance Hayes, Knight\u2019s \u201cbiography is a story of restless Americanness, African Americanness, and poetry. It has some Faulknerian family saga in it, some midcentury migration story, lots of masculine tragedy, lots of soul-of-the-artist lore.\u201d While in prison, Knight began to write poetry, and he corresponded with, and received visits from, Black literary luminaries such as Dudley Randall and Gwendolyn Brooks. His first collection, Poems from Prison (1968) included the following text on its back cover: \u201cI died in Korea from a shrapnel wound, and narcotics resurrected me. I died in 1960 from a prison sentence and poetry brought me back to life.\u201d Knight\u2019s work was immediately lauded as \u201canother excellent example of the powerful truth of blackness in art,\u201d wrote Shirley Lumpkin in the Dictionary of Literary Biography. \u201cHis work became important in Afro-American poetry and poetics and in the strain of Anglo-American poetry descended from Walt Whitman.\u201d\nKnight was married to poet Sonia Sanchez, and both were important members of the poets and artists connected to the Black Arts Movement. His work should be read in the context of that movement\u2019s goals to inspire collective action and develop Black cultural identities distinct from dominant white power structures. As Craig Werner observes in Obsidian: Black Literature in Review: \u201cTechnically, Knight merges musical rhythms with traditional metrical devices, reflecting the assertion of an Afro-American cultural identity within a Euro-American context. Thematically, he denies that the figures of the singer\u2026 and the warrior\u2026 are or can be separate.\u201d Knight went on to attain recognition as a major poet, earning both Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award nominations for Belly Song and Other Poems (1973). Knights honors and awards included fellowships and prizes from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Poetry Society of America. In 1990 he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in American poetry and criminal justice from Martin Center University in Indianapolis.\nWhen Knight entered prison, he was already an accomplished reciter of \u201ctoasts\u201d\u2014long, memorized, narrative poems, often in rhymed couplets, in which \u201csexual exploits, drug activities, and violent aggressive conflicts involving a cast of familiar folk\u2026 are related\u2026 using street slang, drug and other specialized argot, and often obscenities,\u201d explains Lumpkin. Toast-reciting at Indiana State Prison not only refined Knight\u2019s expertise in this traditional Black art form but also, according to Lumpkin, gave him a sense of identity and an understanding of the possibilities of poetry. \u201cSince toast-telling brought him into genuine communion with others, he felt that poetry could simultaneously show him who he was and connect him with other people.\u201d In an article for the Detroit Free Press about Dudley Randall, the founder of Broadside Press, Suzanne Dolezal, indicates that Randall was impressed with Knight and visited him frequently at the prison: \u201cIn a small room reserved for consultations with death row inmates, with iron doors slamming and prisoners shouting in the background, Randall convinced a hesitant Knight of his talent.\u201d\n\r\nMuch of Knight\u2019s prison poetry, according to Patricia Liggins Hill in Black American Literature Forum focuses on imprisonment as a form of contemporary enslavement and looks for ways in which one can be free despite incarceration. Time and space are significant in the concept of imprisonment, and Hill indicates that \u201cspecifically, what Knight relies on for his prison poetry are various temporal/spatial elements which allow him to merge his personal consciousness with the consciousness of Black people.\u201d Hill believes that this merging of consciousness \u201csets him apart from the other new Black poets\u2026 [who] see themselves as poets/ priests\u2026 Knight sees himself as being one with Black people.\u201d Randall observes in Broadside Memories: Poets I Have Known that \u201cKnight does not objure rime like many contemporary poets. He says the average Black man in the streets defines poetry as something that rimes, and Knight appeals to the folk by riming.\u201d Randall notes that while Knight\u2019s poetry is \u201cinfluenced by the folk,\u201d it is also \u201cprized by other poets.\u201d\n\r\nKnight\u2019s Born of a Woman: New and Selected Poems (1980) includes work from Poems from Prison, Black Voices from Prison (1970), a collection of prison poetry from Black inmates that Knight edited, and Belly Song and Other Poems. Reviewing Born of a Woman for Black American Literature Forum, Hill described Knight as a \u201cmasterful blues singer, a singer whose life has been \u2018full of trouble\u2019 and thus whose songs resound a variety of blues moods, feelings, and experiences and later take on the specific form of a blues musical composition.\u201d Lumpkin suggested that an \u201cawareness of the significance of form governed Knight\u2019s arrangement of the poems in the volume as well as his revisions\u2026 He put them in clusters or groupings under titles which are musical variations on the book\u2019s essential theme\u2014life inside and outside prison.\u201d Calling this structure a \u201cjazz composition mode,\u201d Lumpkin also notes that it was once used by Langston Hughes in an arrangement of his poetry.\nIn the Los Angeles Times Book Review Peter Clothier considered Knight\u2019s poems to be \u201ctools for self-discovery and discovery of the world\u2014a loud announcement of the truths they pry loose.\u201d And Knight himself once told CA he believed a definition of art and aesthetics assumes that \u201cevery man is the master of his own destiny and comes to grips with the society by his own efforts. The \u2018true\u2019 artist is supposed to examine his own experience of this process as a reflection of his self, his ego.\u201d Knight felt \u201cwhite society denies art, because art unifies rather than separates; it brings people together instead of alienating them.\u201d The western/European aesthetic dictates that \u201cthe artist speak only of the beautiful (himself and what he sees); his task is to edify the listener, to make him see beauty of the world.\u201d Black artists must stay away from this because \u201cthe red of this aesthetic rose got its color from the blood of black slaves, exterminated Indians, napalmed Vietnamese children.\u201d According to Knight, the black artist must \u201cperceive and conceptualize the collective aspirations, the collective vision of black people, and through his art form give back to the people the truth that he has gotten from them. He must sing to them of their own deeds, and misdeeds.\u201d\nEtheridge Knight died in 1991.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"], "School/Period:": ["Black Arts Movement"]}}
