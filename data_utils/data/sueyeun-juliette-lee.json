She earned a BA from the University of Virginia and an MFA from the University of Massachusetts\u2013Amherst and studied for a PhD at Temple University. Lee is the author of That Gorgeous Feeling (2008), Underground National (2010), Solar Maximum (2015), and No Comet, That Serpent in the Sky Means Noise (2017) among other books. Her writing focuses on birthright, homeland, and identity. In an interview for Entropy magazine, Lee said, \u201cTo write and read a poem is to potentially shake loose the drapes over the machinery, to assist in sensitizing new reading and mindfulness habits that can allow us to see otherwise or through. \u2026 Those who take on poetry as their primary means for engaging the world are choosing to take on this central conundrum of sign, affect, and perception that shapes the consensual reality we inhabit.\u201d\nLee has held fellowships with the Pew Center for Arts & Heritage, Kunstnarhuset Messen, Hafnarborg, and the UCross Foundation. In 2006, she founded Corollary Press, which publishes chapbooks of multi-ethnic writing. Her work has appeared in the Constant Critic, Jacket2, EOAGH, and elsewhere. She lives in Denver, Colorado.\n", "attrs": {}}
