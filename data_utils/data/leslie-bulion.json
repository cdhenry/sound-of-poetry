Originally a social worker, she began writing for children after a family trip to East Africa in 1998. The experience inspired her to write the picture book Fatuma\u2019s New Cloth (2002), winner of the Children\u2019s Africana Book Award. \u00a0 A review of Hey There, Stink Bug! in Booklist describes Bulion\u2019s multilayered approach: she uses both \u201csophisticated allusions and wordplay\u201d and \u201cthe words\u2019 frank, gross-out drama.\u201d In interviews Bulion has discussed her writing process, noting that she composes her poems as parts of \u201ccollections with a central theme, so it all feels connected into a longer work. I research each poem as I go, so each day brings a different kind of work and new ideas to explore.\u201d \u00a0 Bulion\u2019s collections of poems for children include Hey There, Stink Bug! (2006), which was selected as one of the Best Books of 2006 by the Association of Booksellers for Children, and At the Sea Floor Caf\u00e9: Odd Ocean Critter Poems (2011). She has also published several young adult novels, including Missing Pieces (2002), Bank Street Best Book Uncharted Waters (2006), and The Trouble with Rules (2008). \u00a0 She lives in Durham, Connecticut. \ufeff\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
