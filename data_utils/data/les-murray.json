He grew up in poverty on his grandparents\u2019 farm in Bunyah, New South Wales, a district he moved back to with his own family in 1985. The recipient of numerous honors for his poetry, and often referred to as Australia's \u201cBush-bard,\u201d Murray's many poetry collections included The Ilex Tree (with Geoff Lehmann, 1965) and Dog Fox Field (1990), both winners of the Grace Levin Prize for poetry; Subhuman Redneck Poems (1996), winner of the T.S. Eliot Prize for poetry and a UK Poetry Society Choice; Learning Human (2000); Conscious and Verbal (2001); Poems the Size of Photographs (2004); Taller When Prone (2011); New Selected Poems (2014); and Collected Poems (2018). He was also the author of Killing the Black Dog: A Memoir of Depression (2011). The National Trust of Australia named him one of the 100 Australian Living Treasures.\n\r\nRecurrent subjects in Murray\u2019s work are the history and landscape of Australia, white settlers, indigenous life, family, and the rural landscape. The Poetry Book Society said of The Biplane Houses (2006), \u201cHis concerns ... are addressed in poems that range from the polemical and punning to the lyrical and mythic.\u201d His works are replete with imagery of the Australian landscape, but Dan Chiasson has observed that \u201cthe key to Murray ... is not landscape but rage. \u2018How naturally random recording edges into contempt,\u2019 Murray writes, identifying the poles for his combustible temperament.\u201d\n\r\nIn a 1998 BBC interview, Murray explained that his composition of poems takes place in a trance: \u201cIt\u2019s an integration of the body-mind and the dreaming-mind and the daylight-conscious-mind.\u201d\n\r\nMurray\u2019s work has been translated into 10 languages, and he was awarded the Australian Literature Society\u2019s Gold Medal and the Queen\u2019s Gold Medal for Poetry. In 1996 Murray suffered from a liver infection; when he woke after three weeks in a coma, the press reported that he was again \u201cconscious and verbal,\u201d a condition that inspired the title of his 2001 collection of poems.\nMurray died in 2019 at the age of 80.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Australia"]}}
