He moved to New York City when he was 18 after seeing an Andy Warhol painting. Ricard told Interview magazine, \u201cI completely planned out my life looking at that painting.\u201d In New York, Ricard became part of the Warhol Factory scene, appearing in Warhol\u2019s films Kitchen (1965), Chelsea Girls (1966), and, as Warhol himself, in The Andy Warhol Story (1967). He later acted in the neo-punk film Underground U.S.A. (1980).  \u00a0 Ricard began publishing poetry in the late 1960s in journals such as the Paris Review. His collections include Rene Ricard 1979-1980 (1979), which was published by the DIA Foundation to look like the Tiffany Christmas catalog; God with Revolver (1990); Sarcophagus Co. (1990); and Love Poems (1999). In the 1980s, Ricard began to paint poems, sometimes directly onto antique prints or other found works. A monograph of these works, Paintings and Drawings, was published in 2003. Poet Kevin Killian described Ricard\u2019s poem paintings: \u201cWords twist across the surfaces of Ricard\u2019s painting like clotheslines woven from military ribbons, striking attitudes, deft and sassy. Or like folded tubes of toothpaste squeezed into angles and bends. There must be two sorts of people, one who sees the image first, the other who postpones \u2018seeing\u2019 the image until the words are deciphered.\u201d Ricard\u2019s use of text and phrases recalls artists such as Jean-Michel Basquiat. Ricard\u2019s art writings of the early 1980s, especially his essay \u201cThe Radiant Child\u201d in Artforum, are generally thought to have launched the careers of Basquiat and Keith Haring.  \u00a0 A long-time resident of the Chelsea Hotel, \u201cRicard was both a commenter on and participant in some of the most seminal artistic moments of New York City\u2019s vibrant scene,\u201d according to his Rolling Stone obituary. His last show, New Paintings and Not So New, was exhibited by Vito Schnabel\u2019s gallery in 2012. Ricard died in 2014.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
