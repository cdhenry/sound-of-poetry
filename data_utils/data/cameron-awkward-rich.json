Awkward-Rich\u2019s poetry and essays explore artists\u2019 ability to reimagine the politics of social worlds; in an interview with THEthe, he maintains that \u201cwhile I want to say that the most important thing for me in my work and the work of others is this political dimension\u2014does this object help me to imagine other worlds?/give me respite from this one?/expose or rework its harms rather than perpetuate them?\u2014I also think that everything I write and most things other people write fail at this in one way or another. Still, in the attempt to not fail, new possibilities open.\u201d\nA Cave Canem fellow, Awkward-Rich earned a PhD from Stanford University. He teaches women, gender, and sexuality studies at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst\u00a0and\u00a0is an editor at Muzzle Magazine and HEArt. \n", "attrs": {}}
