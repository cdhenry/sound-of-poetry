His collections of poetry include The Great Wave (2009)\u00a0and The Incentive of the Maggot (2005), chosen by poet Robert Pinsky for the Bakeless Poetry Prize and winner of the Larry Levis Reading Prize from Virginia Commonwealth University.\nSusan Barba, reviewing The Incentive of the Maggot in the Boston Review, wrote of Slate\u2019s style,\u00a0\u201che chooses words less for their surprise than their precision. And yet Slate is in command of a varied tonal repertoire.\u201d A successful businessman for over two decades, Slate creates work that is often praised for its maturity and depth. According to the poet Gail Mazur, Slate is \u201cat once a realist uneasily inhabiting a staggeringly surreal universe and a sophisticated surrealist moving easily inside the ordinary life of family, corporate work and international travel, and interpreting his disjointed surroundings with gravity and clarity.\u201d\nSlate and his daughter Jenny Slate co-wrote and published a memoir,\u00a0About The House (2016), helping to raise over $250,000 for nonprofit organizations in the USA and abroad.\nSlate is a board member of the Massachusetts Foundation for the Humanities and a member of the National Book Critics Circle. He\u00a0was a judge for the 2019 PEN America Translation Prize. He has worked as a corporate speechwriter and as vice president of global communications for EMC Corporation.\u00a0He lives in Aquinnah, Massachusetts.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
