Gilliam is the recipient of the 2013 Gift of Freedom Award from A Room of Her Own Foundation.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\r\nGilliam\u2019s first book\u00a0One of Everything\u00a0(2003) tells the stories of four generations of women in her family, beginning on Stepp Mountain in eastern Kentucky and ending in a shopping mall in Akron. Her second book,\u00a0Kettle Bottom (2004), showcases the voices of people living in the coal camps at the time of the 1920-21 West Virginia Mine Wars.\u00a0Kettle Bottom\u00a0has won several prizes, including a Pushcart Prize and the Ohioana Library Association Book of the Year in Poetry. Gilliam also won the the 2008 Chaffin Award for Appalachian Writing.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\nEleanor Wilner has said of\u00a0Kettle\u00a0Bottom, \u201cLike the Michelangelo of her poem who \u2018cuts away everything from the stone that is not David,\u2019 Diane Fisher makes the stone of the West Virginia mountains yield up its human past, and gives a second enduring life through her art to the people of her home place, who would otherwise be \u2018all gone under the hill.\u2019 Her community is fortunate to have harbored such a poet, and American poetry is the larger for this extraordinary book.\u201d\u00a0In her review of\u00a0Kettle Bottom,\u00a0Catherine MacDonald has said, \u201cSet in 1920\u201321, a period of violent unrest known as the West Virginia Mine Wars, the poems in Kettle Bottom combine compelling narratives with the charged, heightened language of lyric poetry. It is an nforgettable combination, one that characterizes the very best contemporary verse.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nGilliam is at work on two projects, supported by her two-year, $50,000 Gift of Freedom Award:\u00a0a collection of poems titled\u00a0The Blackbirds Too, and a\u00a0Young Adult novel in poems that continues the voices of female characters from\u00a0Kettle Bottom.\n\r\nShe lives in Akron, Ohio, where she works as a poet and quilter.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
