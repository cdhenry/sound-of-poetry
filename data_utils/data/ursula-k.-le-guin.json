Le Guin was the author of over 20 novels, a dozen books of poetry, over 100 short stories, and several books of essays. Born in Berkeley, California, she earned a BA from Radcliffe College, an MA in Romance Literature from Columbia University, and then studied in Paris on a Fulbright fellowship. Her fiction gravitated toward the genre of science fiction, with many of her most famous books and stories examining our own world though stories combining fantasy with philosophical inquiry. Le Guin's poetry collections include Late in the Day: Poems 2010-2014, Finding My Elegy: New and Selected Poems (2012), Incredible Good Fortune (2006), and Sixty Odd (1999). She also wrote many books for children and translated writers including Lao Tsu and Gabriela Mistral. She died in early 2018.\n", "attrs": {}}
