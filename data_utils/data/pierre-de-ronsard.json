He served as a page to the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans and to James V, the king of Scotland. After nearly losing all his hearing in 1541, he studied Greek at the Coll\u00e8ge de Coqueret with the esteemed scholar Daurat. He later became the official poet of King Charles IX\u2019s court. Ronsard led a generation of poets, known first as the Brigade and later as Le Pl\u00e9iade, who sought to bring the values of humanism to French verse. \u00a0 Ronsard used a variety of received forms and meters to explore themes of romantic love and portraits of royal life. His numerous collections of poetry include Odes (1550), Les Amours (1552), Le Bocage (1554), and La Franciade (1572).\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"], "School/Period:": ["Renaissance"]}}
