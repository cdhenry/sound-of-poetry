Ferry\u2019s translations, which include some of the world's major works of poetry are known for their fluency and grace. In addition to his lauded translations of The Odes of Horace and Virgil\u2019s The Eclogues, Georgics, and The Aeneid, among other works, Ferry is a prize-winning poet in his own right. His poetic works include\u00a0Dwelling Places\u00a0(1993) and\u00a0Of No Country I Know: New and Selected Poems and Translations\u00a0(1999), which won the Lenore Marshall Prize, the Bingham Poetry Prize, the Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry from the Library of Congress, and was a finalist for the L.L. Winship/PEN New England Award and the\u00a0New Yorker\u00a0Book Award.\u00a0Bewilderment: New Poems and Translations (2012), won the National Book Award for Poetry.\u00a0\n\r\nDavid Ferry was born in 1924 in Orange, New Jersey. He entered the Air Force after his freshman year at Amherst College, returning to complete his degree in 1948. Ferry credits his professors at Amherst with making him \u201cbookish\u201d and admits he \u201cread spottily\u201d as a child. Ferry earned a graduate degree at Harvard University, where he began writing poems and had his first work published in the\u00a0Kenyon Review. In the\u00a0New York Times Book Review,\u00a0Carmeal Ciruaru described Ferry\u2019s poems in\u00a0Of No Country I Know\u00a0as \u201ccontemplative, humble and keenly perceptive. Above all, they are questioning.\u201d Though known for his translations, the collection, which includes work from six previous books, proves the depth and craft of Ferry\u2019s own poetic vision. As Ciruaru notes, \u201chis speakers are not at home in life; they are always on the outside looking in\u2014to their own minds, their bodies, the places they call home.\u201d Ferry\u2019s careful attention to psychological and emotional states led poet W.S. Merwin to proclaim that Ferry deals with \u201ccomplexities of feeling with unfailing proportion and grace.\"\n\r\nThough he did not study Latin or Greek in school, Ferry began translating\u2014or \u201crendering\u201d\u2014ancient poets like Horace in the early 1980s, including three Odes in his book\u00a0Strangers\u00a0(1983). In an interview with Judith Moore, Ferry described the almost accidental path he took to becoming one of American poetry\u2019s great poet-translators: \u201c[A] friend at Harvard who liked my poems and some other translations of mine that he\u2019d seen, began to give me assignments in\u00a0Gilgamesh. I don\u2019t know any Babylonian but I worked from the word-for-word scholarly text, including my friend\u2019s translation of several passages in that poem. He guided me to the other good word-for-word translations and I did this rendering of\u00a0Gilgamesh\u00a0and my friend\u00a0Frank Bidart\u00a0showed it to\u00a0Jonathan Galassi\u00a0at Farrar, Strauss, and he published it.\u201d\n\r\nFerry\u2019s translations since\u00a0Gilgamesh\u00a0have been widely acclaimed. The\u00a0New Criterion\u00a0critic D.S. Carne-Ross declared, \u201cFerry\u2019s governance is so fine that he has made it seem easy to translate Horace.\u201d The\u00a0New York Sun\u00a0praised Ferry\u2019s translation of the\u00a0Georgics\u00a0as \u201ceither tender or grand,\u201d adding that \u201cMr. Ferry's individual pentameters \u2026 are always euphonious, often singable, and sometimes magnificent\u2014truly worthy of the best poet\u2019s best poem.\u201d\u00a0\n\r\nFerry\u2019s many awards include the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award, the Teasdale Prize for Poetry, the Ingram Merrill Award, the William Arrowsmith Translation Prize from\u00a0AGNI\u00a0magazine, and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the Academy of American Poets. In 1998 he was elected a fellow to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received the 2011\u00a0Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize from the Poetry Foundation.\u00a0The Sophie Chantal Hart Professor Emeritus of English at Wellesley College, he is a visiting lecturer in creative writing at Boston University. He was married to the literary critic Anne Ferry until her death in 2006.\n", "attrs": {}}
