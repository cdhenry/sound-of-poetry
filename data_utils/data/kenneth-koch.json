Associated with the New York School of poetry for most of his career, Koch used surrealism, satire, irony, and an element of surprise in many of his poems. Koch explored an assortment of emotions in his poetry, but in an era seemingly dedicated to deep seriousness he refused to relinquish lightness or a sense of humor. According to Phoebe Pettingell in the\u00a0New Leader,\u00a0Koch\u2019s works \u201cconvey his perennial freshness in at least two senses of that word: novelty and cheekiness. He has a subtle grasp of the nuances of language as well as a gift for hilarious parody, and behind his casual, friendly manner there is formidable technique and learning.\u201d The winner of many awards, Koch was a vibrant part of the literary social scene of New York City and an influential voice of his generation.\n\r\nKoch was called \u201cthe funniest serious poet we have,\u201d by David Lehman in\u00a0Newsweek.\u00a0Although Peter Stitt maintained in the\u00a0Georgia Review\u00a0that the author\u2019s \u201cgreatest commitment as a poet is to not making very much sense, to not taking things very seriously,\u201d other critics argue that Koch\u2019s poetry has an underlying seriousness and have praised his imagination and originality. Koch\u2019s \u201cplayfulness, in tone and technique, has often caused him to be underrated,\u201d wrote Salmagundi\u00a0contributor Paul Zweig. \u201cBut it is just his great capacity for humor, based on so much more than mere irony, that makes him important. He has reclaimed the humorous for serious writers of poetry and for that we are in his debt.\u201d Lehman, in his book\u00a0The Last Avant-Garde,\u00a0commented that Koch \u201chad the misfortune to be a protean comic genius at the moment when the lyric poem [was] the be-all and end-all of verse and [was] mistakenly held to be incompatible with the spirit of comedy.\u201d\n\r\nKoch\u00a0addressed the idea of comic poetry in an interview with\u00a0Jordan Davis\u00a0that was published in Koch\u2019s\u00a0The Art of Poetry. \u201cSome readers think of a poem as a sort of ceremony\u2014a funeral, a wedding\u2014where anything comic is out of order. They expect certain feelings to be touched on in certain conventional ways. Dissociation, even obscurity, may be tolerated, but only as long as the tone remains solemn or sad enough.\u201d Koch continued, \u201cThere may be a perfectly serious poem, a good poem \u2026 and some other person writes a parody of it and one line of the parody may have more truth than the whole original poem, or at least be freer to reach the intoxicating heights that sometimes seem where truth is from.\u201d\n\r\nKoch is credited as of the founders of the New York School of poetry, which came into existence in the 1950s. At the time, the poets who were working within the \u201cschool\"\u2014including\u00a0John Ashbery,\u00a0Frank O'Hara, and Koch, among others\u2014hardly considered themselves trendsetters. The name \u201cNew York School\u201d was coined for them by Donald Allen for an anthology he was editing in the late 1950s, and it suggested a spirit of novelty and experimentation that well-suited its young practitioners. \u201cThe so-called New York School assembled its own outsider identity from some of the same sources as the Beats: an urban male savvy, sometimes inflected with Jewish and gay sensibilities, and an openness to avant-garde work in other media,\u201d explained Christopher Benfey in the\u00a0New Republic.\u00a0According to Benfey, Koch was \u201ca conspicuous member of the New York School, often chronicling its exploits and mourning its losses.\u201d Dictionary of Literary Biography\u00a0contributor Michael Adams observed that Koch \u201ccharacterized the New York School style as \u2018antitraditional, opposed to certain heavy uses of irony and symbolism.\u2019\u201d Adams also quoted Koch as saying, \u201cI think we may have been more conscious than many poets of the surface of the poem, and what was going on while we were writing and how we were using words.\u201d\n\r\nLike other poets of the New York School, Koch used stream-of-consciousness in his writing and stressed the importance of the present moment and the ordinary. Pettingell, concluded that pop references and personal asides notwithstanding, Koch\u2019s work continues to stand the test of time quite well. \u201cThe joke is that those bards of the passing scene, Ashbery and Koch, continue to flourish. Indeed, today they appear to exemplify the tenets of postmodernism.\u201d\n\r\nKoch\u2019s first book of poetry, titled simply\u00a0Poems, was\u00a0wide-ranging. In the New York Review of Books, F.W. Dupee wrote that \u201cKoch is fond of making poetry out of poetry-resistant stuff. Locks, lipsticks, business letterheads, walnuts, lunch and fudge attract him; so do examples of inept slang, silly sentiment, brutal behavior and stereotyped exotica and erotica.\u201d Employing the bizarre humor of surrealism and the techniques of abstract expressionism, Koch crafted poems that emphasize form and sound. The words Koch selects to present his subjects surge together \u201clike an express train of exuberant sounds,\u201d observed\u00a0Poetry\u00a0contributor\u00a0David Lehman, adding that \u201cthe poet takes a great deal of delight in the sounds of words and his consciousness of them; he splashes them like paint on a page with enthusiastic puns, internal rhymes, titles of books, names of friends \u2026 and seems surprised as we are at the often witty outcome.\u201d\u00a0\nThe publication of Poems\u00a0sparked the critical debate over the seriousness of Koch\u2019s\u00a0work. Finding the book \u201ctasteless, futile, noisy and\u00a0dull,\u201d Harry Roskolenko argued that \u201cKoch writes lazy verse and is precious and puerile\u201d in\u00a0Poetry\u00a0magazine. This negative review prompted a rebuttal from writer Frank O'Hara, who asserted that Koch \u201chas the other poetic gift: vivacity and go, originality of perception and intoxication with life. Most important of all, he is not\u00a0dull.\u201d\n\r\nKoch seemed to thrive on the intensity in writing a new poem, and many of his verses deal with the poetic imagination and the act of creation.\u00a0Poetry\u00a0contributor Paul Carroll explained: \u201cKoch celebrates that splendid faculty with which men make poetry. His poems embody the poetic imagination as it rejoices in the ebullience of its health and freedom, its fecundity, its capacity for endless invention, its dear, outlandish ability to transform everyday, pragmatic reality into an Oz or a tea-party at the March Hare\u2019s house, its potency in, possibly, achieving a bit of immortality as a result of having brought forth some children of the soul.\u201d\n\r\nIn his next book,\u00a0The Art of Love,\u00a0Koch\u2019s \u201cvoice is unperturbed, offering serene and careless advice on the arts of love and poetry for those who have ears and can hear,\u201d explained Paul Wilner in the\u00a0Village Voice.\u00a0Writing in\u00a0Poetry,\u00a0J.D. McClatchy\u00a0referred to the book as an \u201cerotic romp\u201d; Wilner described it as \u201cupdating Ovid by reinventing the alphabet of emotion.\u201d Zweig added that Koch\u2019s \u201chumor has an edge of satire; his ebullient absurdity slides into an original form of social and cultural criticism, as in \u2018The Artist\u2019 and \u2018Fresh Air,\u2019 both enormously funny epics about the impossibility of art.\u201d In the poem \u201cThe Art of Love,\u201d Koch parodies several advice-giving documents and tries to \u201cenable both poet and reader to distance feelings, ideas, experiences, so as to perceive them strangely, freshly, as if they were rare or even alien curiosities,\u00a0objets d'art,\u00a0perhaps, in some great Bloomingdale\u2019s of the imagination,\u201d asserted\u00a0Sandra M. Gilbert\u00a0in\u00a0Poetry.\u00a0The drawbackto this form of presentation is that detachment can filter in. Shenandoah contributor Conrad Hilberry\u00a0found\u00a0that Koch\u2019s verse, \u201clike pop art, present great simplicity but maintain so much ironic distance that they make the ordinary reader uneasy.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cEvery book of poems by \u2026 Koch seems to be a new beginning, a starting over, a trying-out of new voices, styles and idioms,\u201d observed John Boening in review of\u00a0Days and Nights in\u00a0World Literature Today.\u00a0The poems in the collection are concerned with love, aging, loneliness, the past, and the future; they demonstrate, wrote Mark Hillringhouse in the\u00a0American Book Review, that \u201cKoch has paid more attention to physical detail and places his emotions directly and concretely into the poem.\u201d And the title poem, \u201cDays and Nights,\u201d is phrased in such a way so as to evoke \u201ca whole spectrum of emotions; from lost time to old friends, to travels and defeats to fears of writing itself,\u201d Hillringhouse said. \u201cKoch sets out to explore a new landscape that is honest to the act of writing and to the process of the imagination.\u201d\nOn the Edge,\u00a0explained Mark Hillringhouse in the\u00a0American Book Review, \u201cconsists of two lengthy poems, \u2018Impressions of Africa\u2019 and \u2018On the Edge.\u2019\u00a0 The second was \u201cmore ambitious, ranging widely over the facts and fiction of \u2026 Koch\u2019s life,\u201d wrote\u00a0New York Times Book Review\u00a0correspondent John Ash. It\u00a0moves back and forth between past and present, with \u201cmemories and currencies of sentiment jostling one another,\u201d said Denis Donoghue in\u00a0Commonweal.\u00a0\u00a0Washington Post Book World\u00a0contributor\u00a0Peter Davison\u00a0viewed the allusions the poem relies on as \u201ccalculated to exclude outsiders, to make the non-belonger feel stupid, to make the reader ransack for a footnote.\u201d Ash, however, viewed the book as taking \u201cgreat risks,\u201d and claimed that \u201cwe cannot do better\u201d than appraise the work according to Koch\u2019s \u201cown demanding criteria, set out in his\u00a0Art of Poetry.\u00a0Does it astonish? Is it sufficiently modern? Is it written in his own voice? Is it devoid of \u2018literary, \u201ckiss-me-I'm-poetical\u201d junk\u2019? Is it \u2018serious without being solemn, fresh without being cold\u2019? The answer, in all cases, must be affirmative.\u201d\n\r\nKoch\u2019s next collection, Seasons on Earth, is comprised of \u201cSeasons on Earth\u201d and two of Koch\u2019s previously published comic epics, \u201cKo; or, A Season on Earth\u201d and \u201cThe Duplications.\u201d\u00a0Adams described\u00a0Ko; or A Season on Earth\u00a0as \u201cmodeled partially after Byron\u2019s\u00a0Don Juan\u00a0and Ariosto\u2019s\u00a0Orlando Furioso\u201d that \u201cdetails the misadventures of a group of outlandish characters who flit about from continent to continent, reality to unreality.\u201d Among other things, the poem relates the story of Ko, a Japanese college student who comes to the United States to play baseball.\n\r\nIn the\u00a0Washington Post Book World,\u00a0Terence Winch\u00a0described \u201cThe Duplications\u201d as \u201csomething of a nonsense epic whose seriousness lies more in the demonstration of Koch\u2019s impressive technical skill than in the narrative itself.\u201d There are many \u201cduplications\u201d in the poem, maintained Winch, but the most important ones are the rhymes. And although the poem is a narrative, Winch also suggested that the way in which Koch\u2019s mind works and the language he uses deserve more attention than the actual story. His \u201cwork is important for its singularity as for its exuberant invention, inspired fluency, and histrionic imagination,\u201d concluded Lenhart.\n\r\nKoch\u2019s mature works increasingly demonstrated the poet\u2019s willingness to experiment in a variety of forms. In 1994 he released two poetry collections, following his 1993 volume of short-short stories. All three books earned significant critical response, with the poetry collections cited as factors in awarding Koch the Bollingen Prize. In a review of Koch\u2019s work in the Chicago Tribune,\u00a0Paul Hoover\u00a0hailed the poet as \u201can extravagant improviser, natural formalist and borscht-belt comedian. His poems have daring, ease and sprezzatura; they are formally accomplished without pomposity.\u201d Writing about his collection On the Great Atlantic Rainway, Hoover described Koch as \u201ca poet of intimacy and size, lyricism and intelligence. Because his work is lighthearted, it has been accused of triviality. Yet in poems like his hilarious polemic, \u2018Fresh Air,\u2019 Koch shows the fiercely moral nature of the true satirist.\u201d\n\r\nIn\u00a0Straights\u00a0Koch contributes not only poems but prose and even a fugue; still, the poems on themes of aging, seasonal change and \u201cthe loss of the sacred in everyday life\u201d most accurately characterize the volume.\u00a0Straits\u00a0was viewed as a somewhat mixed bag, according to\u00a0Poetry\u00a0reviewer Ben Howard, although Koch\u2019s most successful entries feature a \u201csophisticated wit and stylistic panache,\u201d both of which \u201cilluminate their subjects.\u201d Noting an autobiographical bent in the collection, a\u00a0Publishers Weekly\u00a0contributor remarked upon perceiving \u201cglimpses of the man behind the curtain\u201d in the collection.\n\r\nKoch reaches even deeper into his own life for the stuff of\u00a0New Addresses\u00a0and\u00a0A Possible World.\u00a0 The two autobiographical collections would prove to be Koch\u2019s last gift to readers; he was by now engaged in the battle against leukemia that would ultimately end his life in July 2002. A\u00a0Publishers Weekly\u00a0reviewer, praising\u00a0New Addresses\u00a0as the poet\u2019s finest work to date, discussed with Koch its autobiographical elements. Examining his life as it revealed itself in the poems of\u00a0New Addresses,\u00a0the poet also came to terms with a pivotal moment in his life: his military service during World War II. \u201cI'd never really been able to write [about the war] because it\u2019s like being psychotic to be in a war. You're walking around with a gun \u2026 and they shoot you!\u201d However, from a distanced perspective, the mature poet found that treating the war as a character, like any other person, \u201cenabled me to get some of the feelings back, like the crazy idea that I couldn\u2019t be killed because I had to write.\u201d Containing \u201cBel Canto,\u201d \u201cVariations on Home and Abroad,\u201d and \u201cA Memoir,\u201d as well as a number of short verses expressing the author\u2019s love of travel,\u00a0A Possible World \u201cdisplays Koch\u2019s verve and light touch,\u201d according to a\u00a0Publishers Weekly\u00a0contributor, although the overall mood of the collection \u201cis unmistakably colored by requiem.\u201d\n\r\nKoch also wrote many short plays that critics have praised for their equal measures of parody, satire, and irony. As Koch said in his interview with Davis, \u201cI like plays that are astounding in some way\u2014that make convincing what is unusual and even, seemingly, impossible.\u201d Denis Donoghue suggested in a\u00a0New York Review of Books\u00a0essay that in\u00a0Bertha and Other Plays, \u201cKoch implies in his smiling way that nothing is too silly to be said or sung, provided we know exactly how silly it is.\u201d In the\u00a0New York Review of Books,\u00a0Stephen Spender\u00a0described Koch\u2019s plays as inventive and having \u201cthe funniness which comes out of exuberant vitality.\u201d Koch\u2019s cast of characters in One Thousand Avant-garde Plays, wrote David Lehman in the Washington Post Book World, David Lehman, includes Lord Byron, Bozo, Olive Oyl, a Chinese cook, Little Red Riding Hood, Watteau, and hippopotami. The plays are, Lehman wrote, \u201ca pure act of poetic invention.\u201d\n\r\nAside from writing poetry, Koch also devoted his time to teaching poetry to children and the elderly. He was a member of the faculty at Columbia University for many years. In 1968 he began his experiment with children at P.S. 61, a New York City elementary school. His\u00a0Wishes, Lies, and Dreams: Teaching Children to Write Poetry\u00a0describes how writing became exciting for these students and includes some of his students\u2019 poetry.\u00a0Saturday Review\u00a0contributor Herbert Kohl considered the work \u201cperhaps the best book I have read portraying the joy and excitement young people experience when writing in a happy place where people care about their work.\u201d\n\r\nAlthough the students in Koch\u2019s class wrote some exceptional poetry, Koch didn\u2019t stop there. As John Gardner explained in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review, \u201cThe children themselves felt a need for something more. Koch\u2019s response was to shift the experiment to \u2018teaching great poetry to children,\u2019 thus broadening the tradition available to them.\u201d The record of this experiment and its tremendous results is\u00a0Rose, Where Did You Get That Red?: Teaching Great Poetry to Children.\u00a0Koch also worked with the residents of Manhattan\u2019s American Nursing Home. I Never Told Anybody: Teaching Poetry Writing in a Nursing Home\u00a0was the result.\u201d At first unresponsive, the elderly and infirm students learned \u201cto summon and repeat words joyfully, to exaggerate enthusiastically, to celebrate contrasts, to become immersed in nature, to imagine all sorts of places, to put themselves into many different kinds of shoes,\u201d wrote Robert Coles in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review.\n\r\n\u201cI seem to go on being influenced, and encouraged, by what I read,\u201d Koch said of his work as a poet. He also served as an influence to the writers who have followed in his wake. \u201cKoch\u2019s poetry remains an underrated treasure, arousing discipleship and high ardor wherever the spirit of the New York school is strong and ignored wherever not,\u201d Lehman noted in his book. In World Literature Today, Bernard F. Dick observed that the author\u2019s body of work depicts \u201ca poet\u2019s progress, beginning with self-conscious experimentation in the usual way of finding a voice and ending with a voice as distinctive and resonant as the ones that echo through the poetry.\u201d Koch\u2019s poems \u201cattest to a creative power and its gradual refinement, as life and art, the playful and the profound,\u201d wrote Dick.\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["New York School"]}}
