Donald Hall said of Edson\u2019s poetry, \u201cIt\u2019s fanciful, it\u2019s even funny\u2014but his humor carries discomfort with it, like all serious humor.\u201d And Peter Schejeldahl pointed out that his poems have \u201cthe sustained wackiness of old Warner Brothers cartoons.\u201d\n\r\nIn an interview with Mark Tursi, Edson once said of his writing process, \u201cMy job as a writer is mainly to edit the creative rush. The dream brain is the creative engine\u2026 I sit down to write with a blank page and a blank mind. Wherever the organ of reality (the brain) wants to go I follow with the blue-pencil of consciousness.\u201d\n\r\nEdson\u2019s father, Gus, was a cartoonist and the creator of the character Art Gump. Edson studied art as a teenager, attending the Art Students League when he was 16. In the 1960s he began publishing poetry and received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. His collections of poetry include The Brain Kitchen: Writings and Woodcuts (1965), The Clam Theatre (1973), The Wounded Breakfast: Ten Poems (1985), The Tormented Mirror (2001), The Rooster\u2019s Wife (2005), and See Jack (2009). He also wrote a book of plays, The Falling Sickness (1975), and the novels Gulping's Recital (1984) and The Song of Percival Peacock (1992). He lived for many years in Stamford and Darien, Connecticut. Russell Edson died in 2014.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
