Educated at Bennington College in Vermont, she moved to New York City after graduation. While submitting her poetry to magazines, Howes got a job editing Chimera: A Literary Magazine from 1944 to 1947. Although the job kept her from her own writing for several years, it would prove to be valuable, not only because it put her in contact with numerous other writers living in the city, but also because of the editorial skills Howes developed. These skills would be put to good use several years later when she edited several acclaimed short story anthologies: From the Green Antilles: Writings of the Caribbean (1966), The Eye of the Heart: Short Stories from Latin America (1973), and The Sea-Green Horse (1970) a young-adult short story anthology Howes compiled with her son, Gregory Jay Smith.\nDespite being nominated for the 1995 National Book Award for her The Collected Poems of Barbara Howes, 1945-1990, the work of poet Barbara Howes has received relatively little publicity; Robert Richman, writing in the New York Times, called Howes \u201cas obscure a worthy poet as I can think of.\u201d Usually alternating her backdrop between the gentle climate of the West Indies and the harsher landscape of her native New England, Howes\u2019s verses paint a world of family, natural surroundings, and the wisdom inherent in natural inclinations. \u201cI might say that my poems are about relationships,\u201d she wrote by way of explanation in an essay published in Contemporary Authors Autobiography Series (CAAS)\u2014\u201cthe relation of the poet\u2019s eye, mind, and heart to reality.\u201d\nHowes\u2019s first collection of verse, The Undersea Farmer, was published in 1948. While recognizing that hers was a young talent, reviewers were quick to see the book as the work of an accomplished poet. 1954\u2019s In the Cold Country further refined Howes\u2019s considerable abilities, drawing even more critical acclaim. Praising her as \u201cthe most accomplished women poet of the younger writing generation,\u201d Louise Bogan commented in New Yorker on Howes\u2019s \u201cstrong, positive emotions that continually resolve into a major key.\u201d \u201cWe sense the possibility of a new reconciliation in modern verse,\u201d concluded Bogan, \u201cfor so long filled with division and dissent.\u201d\nComparing Howes\u2019 verse to that of poet Wallace Stevens, Thom Gunn noted in Yale Review that \u201cat her best ... the very indirection of her style contributes to her meaning. Her most considerable power is in her control over language.\u201d This control was exhibited throughout Howes\u2019 work, in volumes that include Light and Dark (1959), Looking Up at Leaves (1966), and The Blue Garden (1972), which Robert B. Shaw termed remarkable \u201cfor the clarity of its descriptive passages\u201d in a review in Poetry. Her best work was anthologized in Collected Poems in 1990.\nAlthough she was acknowledged for her skill as a stylist, Howes was always quick to explain that her abilities are not the obvious outlet of \u201cGod-given\u201d talent. \u201cOne does not own one\u2019s talent ... and should not identify with it,\u201d she explained in her essay for CAAS; \u201crather, one works at it, is responsible for tending this blithe or gloomy spirit which can flash in and fade out in its own inexplicable way. ... [T]alent, and the artist who houses and labors over it, are not one.\u201d Although recognizing that the possession of talent is necessary to any poetic endeavor, Howes added that \u201cthe other base from which any art springs is simply real, steady work. If one sits around waiting for the lightning of inspiration to strike, it will surely descend over the way, where another poet is hard at it.\u201d\n", "attrs": {}}
