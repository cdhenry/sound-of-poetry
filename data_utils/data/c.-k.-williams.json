Williams created a highly respected body of work, including several collections of original poems, volumes of translations and criticism, and a memoir. Williams was especially known as an original stylist; his characteristic line is extraordinarily long, almost prose-like, and emphasizes characterization and dramatic development. His early work focused on overtly political issues such as the Vietnam War and social injustice. In his later work, Williams shifted from a documentary style toward a more introspective approach, writing descriptive poems that revealed the states of alienation, deception, and occasional enlightenment that exist between public and private lives in modern urban America.\n\r\nWilliams was born in Newark, New Jersey and educated at Bucknell College and the University of Pennsylvania. Though he was encouraged by his father to read and memorize poems, Williams didn\u2019t begin to write poetry until his late teens. He soon found success, however, and Williams\u2019s early poetry was often promoted by other poets. His first book, Lies (1969), was published upon the recommendation of Anne Sexton who, according to Allan M. Jalon in the Los Angeles Times, called Williams \u201cthe Fellini of the written word.\u201d The book was widely acclaimed: M.L. Rosenthal in Poetry described it as a collection of poems that portrays \u201cpsychic paralysis despite the need to make contact with someone.\u201d The book\u2019s final poem, \u201cA Day for Anne Frank,\u201d which had been published separately a year earlier, was praised by Alan Williamson in Shenandoah as \u201ca surprisingly moving poem, one of the best in the book.\u201d\n\r\nWilliams\u2019s next three books were also critical successes. I Am the Bitter Name (1972; reprinted 1992) is largely a collection of protest poems about the fear and hatred nurtured by America\u2019s involvement in the Vietnam War. It is Williams\u2019s next book, With Ignorance (1977; reprinted 1997), however, that first shows the development of the poet\u2019s trademark style; as James Atlas explained in the Nation, \u201cthe lines are so long that the book had to be published in a wide-page format, like an art catalogue,\u201d giving the poetry \u201can eerie incantatory power.\u201d Tar (1983) employs the same expansive line, which allows for philosophical investigation and qualification. The title poem circles the nuclear reactor disaster at Three Mile Island in characteristically Williams fashion, finding dangerous equivalences in as mundane an endeavor as roofing.\n\n\u00a0In Flesh and Blood (1987) Williams changed format, but not subject matter. The book is a collection of eight-line poems, each line of twenty or twenty-five syllables and printed two poems to a page. Michael Hofmann, in the Times Literary Supplement, pointed out the poems\u2019 subjects are \u201cthe by-now familiar gallery of hobos and winos, children and old people, lovers and invalids; the settings, typically, public places, on holidays, in parks, on pavements and metro-stations.\u201d Edward Hirsch, writing in the New York Times Book Review, described Williams\u2019s poetry as having a \u201cnotational, ethnographic quality\u201d that presents \u201csingle extended moments intently observed.\u201d Even though these poems sometimes read \u201clike miniature short stories, sudden fictions,\u201d Hirsch continued, they always present people in situations where they are \u201cvulnerable, exposed, on the edge.\u201d The book won Williams the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1987.\n\r\nWilliams\u2019s first volume of selected poems, Poems 1963-1983 (1988), collects selections from Lies and I Am the Bitter Name, and reproduces both With Ignorance and Tar in their entirety. Muldoon called it \u201cthe book of poems I most enjoyed this year,\u201d finding Williams to have \u201can enviable range of tone\u201d and to be \u201cby turns tender and troubling.\u201d Hofmann claimed that the book \u201chas as much scope and truthfulness as any American poet since Lowell and Berryman.\u201d Williams himself, in a Los Angeles Times interview with Allan Jalon, stated that he believes \u201cthe drama of American poetry is based very much on experience. It\u2019s coming out of all the different cultures. We\u2019re an enormous nation and we have an enormous poetry.\u201d The Vigil (1997) and Repair (1999) both feature the long, prose-like lines that were Williams\u2019s signature. Richard Howard, reviewing The Vigil for the Boston Review found that \u201cThe lines [in The Vigil] have to array some of the most garish and clunky language assayed in recent poetry,\u201d but he appreciated their suitability for narration and description. \u201cSo vivid are Williams\u2019s successes with immediacy of sensation and of narration, so overwhelming his virtuosity...in revving up his chosen, his imposed machine,\u201d Howard concluded, \u201cthat I am most of the time transfixed by his gift.\u201d\n\r\nWilliams\u2019s later work, particularly in Repair, developed an increasingly intimate tone. Repair, which won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and was a finalist for the National Book Award, is often personal and introspective. The poems consider such subjects as the birth of the poet\u2019s grandson, the death of a friend\u2019s child, love, and the flowered house dresses worn by his mother and the women of her generation. Yet Williams also includes reminders of his earlier, more socially aware material, including the title poem, which points a righteous finger at a tyrant whose \u201chenchmen had disposed of enemies ... by hammering nails into their skulls.\u201d Critic Brian Phillips, in the New Republic, acknowledged Willliams\u2019s skills at observation and description, concluding that \u201c[Williams\u2019s] work reflects the moral self-questioning of Herbert, the plain-spokenness and the yearning toward nature of Wordsworth, the foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart of the later Yeats.\u201d\nWilliams\u2019s collection The Singing (2003) won the National Book Award in 2003. Three years later, Williams\u2019s Collected Poems (2006) was published. Over 600 pages long, the book received major critical attention and provided an opportunity for readers to follow the arc of Williams\u2019s long career. In the International Herald Tribune, Dan Chiasson reviewed Williams\u2019s major achievement: his ability to get the \u201cratio of sympathy to detachment\u2026just right\u201d so that \u201cdocumentary precision and the wide-angle embellishments of \u2018art\u2019 find perfect balance.\u201d In 2012 Williams published his nineteenth book of poetry, Writers Writing Dying. A collection of his later poems, Selected Later Poems, was published posthumously in 2015.\r\nIn addition to his acclaimed memoir, Misgivings: My Mother, My Father, Myself (2000), Williams also wrote works of critical prose, including Poetry and Consciousness (1998), which included Williams\u2019s meditations on psychology, the relation of poetry to history and the novel, as well as reflections on his own creative process, and the book of essays, In Time: Poets, Poems, and the Rest (2012). Williams was also a noted translator. His translation of The Bacchae of Euripides (1990) received widespread praise for its plain, vigorous language and attention to the possibilities of the stage. He also translated the poetry of Adam Zagajewski and Francis Ponge.\n\r\nC.K. Williams received many honors and awards over his long career, including an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Lila Wallace-Reader\u2019s Digest Award, a Pushcart Prize, the PEN/Voelcker Award for Poetry and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Award. Averill Curdy, commenting on The Singing in a Poetry magazine round table discussion, noted that Williams \u201cis one of the poets of his generation who is still singing, who hasn\u2019t retreated into a pokey nostalgia or silence. His poems remain vital to me in their attempt to address the contemporary world, and I find the attempt itself moving.\u201d Williams taught at Princeton University from 1996 until just before his death, in fall 2015.\r\n\u00a0\r\n[Updated 2015]\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
