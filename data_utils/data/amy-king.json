Her writing, which shows elements of Language poetry, has been influenced by her work with Charles Bernstein and Susan Howe in Buffalo, although she is also drawn to confessional and New York School poets. She has cited C\u00e9sar Vallejo, Gertrude Stein, Laura (Riding) Jackson, and John Ashbery as her current influences. While applying pressure to the boundaries of \u201cqueer\u201d poetry, King also finds inspiration in pop culture, science,\u00a0social taxonomies, and other questions of gender, ontology, and culture.\r\n\u00a0\r\nKing's most recent collection, The Missing Museum, is a winner of the 2015 Tarpaulin Sky Book Prize.\u00a0John Ashbery described her poems in I Want to Make You Safe (Litmus Press, 2011) as bringing \u201cabstractions to brilliant, jagged life, emerging into rather than out of the busyness of living.\u201d\u00a0The book was named one of the\u00a0Boston Globe\u2019s Best Poetry Books of 2011. King\u00a0is also the author of the poetry collections\u00a0Slaves to do These Things (Blazevox, 2009),\u00a0I\u2019m the Man Who Loves You\u00a0(Blazevox, 2007), and\u00a0Antidotes for an Alibi (Blazevox, 2005). Her chapbooks include Kiss Me with the Mouth of Your Country (Dusie Press, 2007), The Good Campaign (2006), The Citizen\u2019s Dilemma\u00a0(2003), and The People Instruments (Pavement Saw Press, 2002). Her poems have been nominated for several Pushcart Prizes, and her essays have appeared in\u00a0Boston Review,\u00a0Poetry, and The\u00a0Rumpus.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn 2015, King received the WNBA Award from the Women\u2019s National Book Association, joining the ranks of Ann Patchett, Eleanor Roosevelt, Rachel Carson, and Pearl S. Buck.\u00a0She was also honored by the Feminist Press as one of the \u201c40 Under 40: The Future of Feminism\u201d awardees, and she received the\u00a02012 SUNY Chancellor\u2019s Award for Excellence in Scholarship and Creative Activities.\r\n\u00a0\r\nKing serves on the executive board of\u00a0VIDA: Woman in Literary Arts\u00a0and is.\u00a0She also moderates\u00a0the\u00a0Women\u2019s Poetry Listserv\u00a0(WOMPO) and for many years she moderated\u00a0the\u00a0Poetics List, sponsored by the Electronic Poetry Center.\u00a0She also founded and curated the Brooklyn-based reading series,\u00a0The Stain of Poetry,\u00a0from 2006 to 2010.\r\n\u00a0\r\nKing coedited\u00a0Poets for Living Waters\u00a0and\u00a0Big Energy Poets: Ecopoetry\u00a0Thinks Climate Change.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
