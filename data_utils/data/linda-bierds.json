She earned her BA and MA, with an emphasis in fiction, from the University of Washington. Bierds\u2019s many collections of poetry include Flights of the Harvest Mare (1985); Heart and Perimeter (1991); The Ghost Trio (1994), which was a Notable Book Selection by the American Library Association; The Seconds (2001); First Hand (2005);\u00a0Flight: New and Selected Poems (2008); and Roget\u2019s Illusion (2014) was a longlist nominee for the National Book Award.\u00a0In Blackbird Susan Settlemyre Williams praised the scope and persistence of Bierds\u2019s vision: \u201cFlight \u2026 with its thirty-four-year perspective on her career, strongly suggests that Bierds is writing, if not in, then at least out of the Northern Renaissance, that period and culture in which Dutch, Flemish, and German artists and scientists imposed their own sensibilities on the spirit of discovery and invention that began to the south. Like those old discoverers, Bierds\u2019s poetry explores the trajectory of human possibility.\u201d\nBierds credits her poetry\u2019s distinct style and interests to her early work as a fiction writer. She spoke to Contemporary Authors about life after receiving her degree:\u201cOnce on my own, writing each morning before going to a part-time job as a file clerk, it was poetry that attracted me. In fact, I have written only poetry since receiving the degree. My early training in fiction, however, informs all of my work and results in poems that have been described as \u2018lyrical narratives.\u2019\u201d\nBierds\u2019s \u201clyrical narratives\u201d deal primarily with history and science, and she frequently employs dramatic monologue\u2014using characters ranging from Philip I of Spain to Albrecht D\u00fcrer\u2014to render unique the historical circumstances of individual speakers. In part, working with personae allows Bierds to explore definitions of selfhood while escaping confession. In Octopus Jeff Encke noted that \u201cBierds\u2019 personae collectively strive to mend modern fragmentation, not to herald a return to a premodern state of absolute certainty\u2014hardly that!\u2014but to affirm the essentially human character of this striving.\u201d David Baker, writing in the Kenyon Review, observed that Bierds undertakes \u201ca fascinating investigation of historical characters in the midst of discovery, invention, travail, and\u2026 dramatic understanding.\u201d Baker, who described Bierds's verse as \u201clong, uneven lines and equally uneven stanzas\u2014creating a ragged, prose-like density,\u201d declared that \u201cBierds chooses to dramatize the more particular, critical moments in the lives of others so we might, for ourselves, determine how to invent, discover, create.\u201d Bierds herself told Contemporary Authors: \u201cI find no greater joy in the process of writing a poem than in those hours of research needed to create its world. It is during those hours that the borders of time slip away. If successful, the resulting poem will maintain that fusion of times and will create, for the moments it is read, a kind of eternity, the kind the imagination renders.\u201d\n\r\nKnown for their erudition, dense verbal surfaces, and scientific grounding, Bierds\u2019s poems navigate the boundaries of consciousness, poetry, history, and science. Encke described Bierds as writing a \u201chigh sentence,\u201d adding that she \u201capproaches each poem, as Fellini approached film, with an infinite capacity for wonder. The principal strengths of her poetry are its otherworldly detail and consistently sensuous music, subtly controlled.\u201d Bierds\u2019s poetry is often the product of sustained scholarship, and she has occasionally been charged with obscurity. However, Bierds has argued that poetry has no \u201cone answer,\u201d and \u201cart thrives on diversity, not conformity.\u201d\n\r\nBierds is the recipient of numerous honors and awards, including fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Ingram Merrill Foundation, the Poetry Society of America, and the MacArthur Foundation. She has received the PEN/West Poetry Prize, the Washington State Governor\u2019s Writers Award, the Consuelo Ford Award from the Poetry Society of America, and four Pushcart Prizes. Bierds is the Grace M. Pollock Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Washington. She lives on Bainbridge Island.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
