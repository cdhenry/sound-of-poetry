Blumenthal was born in 1949 in Vineland, New Jersey. A poet, essayist, novelist, and translator, Blumenthal began his career as a lawyer. He earned his JD from Cornell Law School, and later went on to study clinical psychology at Antioch.\u00a0Blumenthal once commented: \u201cLike many poets, I came to my vocation, one might say, through the back door, having struggled through years of seemingly desirable yet (to me) unsatisfying jobs, while \u2018stealing\u2019 the time for my true work. The original impetus for my writing, perhaps, was best reflected in a statement made by Robert Mezey\u2014\u2018I am a man, a Piscean, and unhappy, and therefore I make up poems\u2019\u2014but I feel, now, that my work derives from the healthier (and happier) desire to tap the sources of my own inner wisdom, and to make music of it.\u201d\n\r\nBlumenthal\u2019s poetry collections include Sympathetic Magic (1980), which won the Water Mark Poets of North America First Book Prize;\u00a0Laps (1984), winner of the Juniper Prize;\u00a0Dusty Angel (1999), winner of the Isabella Steward Gardner Prize;\u00a0And: Poems (2009);\u00a0No Hurry: Poems 2000-2012 (2012), and Breaking News: Poems Selected and New, 1980-2020\u00a0(forthcoming). Critic Helen Vendler described Blumenthal\u2019s second collection of poetry, Days We Would Rather Know (1982), as \u201ca buoyant and odd new presence to contemporary American poetry.\u201d Vendler pointed out that while Blumenthal\u2019s subjects, such as the Holocaust or mental doubt, might be termed \u201ctragic,\u201d the approach he takes in his poetry creates \u201cpoems exhilarating to read, full of lifts and turbulence.\u201d Blumenthal\u2019s later books have also been praised for their gentle wit and penetrating insight. David Yezzi, in Poetry, noted that Blumenthal \u201cwrites wonderful satire,\u201d and critic Jay Parini described the poems in Blumenthal\u2019s book And as \u201ctruth-giving,\u201d noting their \u201cradical innocence acquired the hard way, by passing through the crucible of experience.\u201d\n\r\nHis novel Weinstock Among the Dying (1993) casts a baleful eye at academia, using the psychoanalytic process as a framing device. The book won the Ribalow Prize for Best Work of Jewish Fiction. Blumenthal\u2019s nonfiction includes from When History Enters the House: Essays from Central Europe (1998), a collection of short essays he wrote during his years in central Europe,\u00a0 and a remembrance of his youth, All My Mothers and Fathers: A Memoir (2002).\n\r\nThe Briggs-Copeland lecturer in poetry at Harvard University from 1983-1992, Blumenthal ultimately became director of its Creative Writing program. From 1992 to 1996 he lived and worked in Budapest, Hungary as a senior Fulbright lecturer. Since then, he has been visiting professor at universities and colleges both in the United States and abroad. His many honors and awards include fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Ingram-Merrill Foundation. He received the Lavan Younger Poets Award in 1985, and the poetry prize of the Society for Contemporary Literature in German in 2009. He holds the Copenhaver Distinguished Visiting Chair at West Virginia University.\n\r\n\u201cI write poetry,\u201d Blumenthal once commented, \u201cquite unashamedly, because I believe, as Howard Nemerov has said, that \u2018the beautiful is still among the possible,\u2019 and that it redeems us, and as a screen against (and a reminder of) my own wickedness and complexity. As for my poems, it seems to me that only they can speak of themselves.\u201d\n", "attrs": {}}
