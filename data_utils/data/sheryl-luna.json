She earned her BA at Texas Tech University, an MFA from the University of Texas at El Paso, an MA in English from Texas Woman\u2019s University, and a PhD in Contemporary Literature from the University of North Texas. Poets & Writers Magazine\u00a0named Luna as one of the \u201c18 Debut Poets who Made their Mark in 2005.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nLuna's first collection of poetry, Pity the Drowned Horses (2004), won the first Andres Montoya Poetry Prize, sponsored by the Institute of Latino Studies and the Creative Writing program at the University of Notre Dame, and was a\u00a0finalist for the National Poetry Series and the Colorado Book Awards. Pity the Drowned Horses focuses on cultural identity, bridges, and barriers between the U.S. and Mexico border. Poet and final Montoya Prize judge Robert Vasquez commented on Luna\u2019s writing style: \u201cher syntax\u2014sometimes raw and edgy\u2014creates a tableau where everything rushes toward \u2018our wild need, all sweat, all shiver. The overall effect is simply mesmerizing.\u2019\u201d\u00a0Luna's second collection of poems,\u00a0Seven\u00a0(2013),\u00a0was runner up for the Ernest Sandeen Poetry Prize.\n\r\nLuna has been awarded fellowships from the Corporation of Yaddo, the Anderson Center, the Ragdale Foundation, and Canto Mundo.
