His early life was marked by loss: when the boy was two years old, his father died, and seven years later, his stepfather died. As a seminary student at T\u00fcbingen Stift, he studied Lutheran theology alongside future philosophers Georg Wilhelm Friedrich\u00a0Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. After leaving the church, H\u00f6lderlin worked as a tutor. With his seminary classmate Isaac von Sinclair, H\u00f6lderlin was arrested for treason in 1805, but he was declared mentally unfit and institutionalized in 1806. He was released in 1807 and spent the rest of his life in the care of a foster family in a tower in T\u00fcbingen overlooking the river Neckar.  \u00a0 In his poetry, he incorporated classical Greek syntax and mythology while engaging themes of exile, divinity, and the natural world. \u201cThe difficulty of translating Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin's poems into English is rooted in the way he forged the syntax and traditions of both the Greek and German languages into a language foreign to, yet complicit in both,\u201d observes Francisco Guevara in a 2009 review for Words Without Borders of two recent translations of H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s poetry: Odes and Elegies (2008, translated and edited by Nick Hoff) and Selected Poems of Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin (2008, translated by Maxine Chernoff and Paul Hoover), which won a PEN USA Award for Translation. H\u00f6lderlin is also the author of the two-volume epistolary novel Hyperion (1797 and 1799), translated by Ross Benjamin in 2008. H\u00f6lderlin translated into German Sophocles\u2019s Oedipus the King (1804) and Antigone (1804).  \u00a0 H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s work significantly influenced modern poetry and philosophy, including the writings of Nietzsche, Rilke, Heidegger, and Celan.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Germany"], "School/Period:": ["Romantic"]}}
