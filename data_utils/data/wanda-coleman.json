Her language jumps off the page,\u201d wrote Camille Paglia in More magazine. The author of 20 books of poetry and prose, Coleman\u2019s work is focused on racism and the outcast status of living below the poverty line in California, specifically her long-time home, Los Angeles. Her subjects are often controversial and her tone unapologetic. \u201cColeman frequently writes to illuminate the lives of the underclass and the disenfranchised, the invisible men and women who populate America\u2019s downtown streets after dark, the asylums and waystations, the inner city hospitals and clinics,\u201d Tony Magistrale wrote in\u00a0Black American Literature Forum. \u201cWanda Coleman, like\u00a0Gwendolyn Brooks\u00a0before her, has much to tell us about what it is like to be a poor black woman in America.\u201d\nBorn Wanda Evans in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1946, Coleman was encouraged to read by her parents and loved books. She began writing poetry as a child of 5 and published her first poems in a local newspaper at age 13. However, she didn\u2019t enjoy the public schools she attended in the 1950s and 1960s, and considered them \u201cdehumanizing,\u201d according to Kathleen K. O'Mara, who wrote about the poet in\u00a0American Short-Story Writers Since World War II. Coleman attended several colleges. While she never earned a degree, she often conducted workshops, and teaches at university level. Married and the mother of two children by age 20, she worked many different kinds of jobs during the 1970s and 1980s. She developed her craft at night and on weekends by attending writing workshops in and around Los Angeles, some springing up in the aftermath of the Watts Riots (August 1965) and encouraging what has become known as \u201cat risk youth\u201d; they included playwright Frank Greenwood\u2019s Saturday workshop, novelist Budd Schulberg\u2019s Watts Writers Workshop, Studio Watts, and Beyond Baroque. By 1969 she had divorced her first husband and planned to become a professional writer, but was forced to turn her energies to more pragmatic concerns. She supported her family by waiting tables and typing, among other jobs. In part, the difficulty of finding time to write while working led Coleman to concentrate on poetry.\n\r\nColeman published her first short story, \u201cWatching the Sunset,\u201d in\u00a0Negro Digest/Black World\u00a0in 1970. During the 1970s Coleman experimented in theater, dance, television, and journalism. She won an Emmy for her work as a writer for the television soap opera\u00a0Days of Our Lives\u00a0from 1975 to 76, but Coleman\u2019s passion for noncommercial writing was undiminished. Her interest in poetry was deepened by the opportunity to make dramatic public performances. As she participated in the Los Angeles poetry scene, Coleman was influenced by poets\u00a0Henri Coulette,\u00a0Diane Wakoski, John Thomas,\u00a0Clayton Eshleman, and\u00a0Charles Bukowski, and mentored by Black Sparrow Press publisher \u201cPapa\u201d John Martin. Her first poetry manuscript was published as the chapbook\u00a0Art in the Court of the Blue Fag\u00a0in 1977.\u00a0\n\r\nWithin a few years, Coleman\u2019s work gained her attention from outside of the local literary circle.\u00a0Mad Dog Black Lady\u00a0(1979) and\u00a0Imagoes\u00a0(1983) earned her a National Endowment for the Arts grant (1981-82) and a Guggenheim Fellowship for Poetry (1984). In 1987 the author published her first collection to include short stories as well as poetry,\u00a0Heavy Daughter Blues. An all-fiction volume published the next year,\u00a0A War of Eyes and Other Stories\u00a0(1988), strengthened a surge of critical attention and praise focused on Coleman during the 1980s. Her first novel,\u00a0Mambo Hips and Make Believe, described as \u201cambitious,\u201d appeared in 1999.\u00a0Jazz and Twelve O\u2019Clock Tales, a second volume of Coleman\u2019s short stories, was published in 2008 by Black Sparrow Books, which had become a new imprint of David R. Godine, following the retirement of Black Sparrow. University of Pittsburgh Press continued to publish her poetry, and a new volume,\u00a0Ostinato Vamps, appeared in 2003.\n\r\nThe collection of autobiographical stories and prose poems titled\u00a0African Sleeping Sickness\u00a0came out in 1990, including \u201cWhere the Sun Don't Shine\u201d which won the 1990 Harriette Simpson Arnow Prize for fiction. After the collection\u2019s publication, O\u2019Mara wrote, \u201cWhat little negative criticism she has drawn has focused on her fragmentary vignettes as sketches that leave the reader wanting more, or her violence-laden plots as sometimes too predictable. Her finest skill is making human pain poetically concrete and devising dialogue that allows the reader under the skin of \u2018the other.\u2019\u201d\n\nNative in a Strange Land (1996), a book of essays and articles offered readers a selection of non-fiction by Coleman including a 70s interview of reggae giant Bob Marley. First published over 30 years, they were edited for republication. \u201cShe gives us L.A. as a microcosm of what America is today and where it is heading,\u201d Publishers\u2019 Weekly wrote. \u201cThe picture is not always hopeful.\u201d The review also noted the author\u2019s \u201cwry sense of humor\u201d and called some of her ideas \u201cSwiftian\u201d for their gruesomely humorous bent. The book was described by Janice E. Braun in\u00a0Library Journal as a \u201cnonlinear memoir\u201d; Braun concluded \u201cWhether one identifies with Coleman or objects to her views, the writing is positively outstanding.\u201d The 1998 poetry collection\u00a0Bathwater Wine returned Coleman\u2019s readers to a more familiar form. It was described by\u00a0Publishers Weekly\u00a0as \u201can encyclopedic, moment-by-moment accounting of left coast rage, witness and transcendence \u2026 .\u201d It received the 1999 Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize, the first given to a work by an African American woman.\nHer collection\u00a0Mercurochrome\u00a0was a bronze-medal finalist in poetry for the 2001 National Book Awards. She has also received awards from the California Arts Council in fiction (1982) and poetry (2002), a proclamation from the city of Los Angeles, and received the first literary award from the its Department of Cultural Affairs (COLA) in 2003. She was a nominee for California state poet laureate, and was considered the unofficial poet laureate of Los Angeles.\nHer other creative interests not only included music, but the visual arts and a passion for theatre and public speaking. \u201cAs a poet,\u201d she once told\u00a0Contemporary Authors, \u201cI have gained a reputation, locally, as an electrifying performer/reader, and have appeared at local rock clubs, reading the same poetry that has taken me into classrooms and community centers for over five hundred public readings since 1973.\u201d Frequently invited to perform in prisons, campuses, rock clubs, and at institutions across the United States, and overseas (Amsterdam, Paris, Stockholm, Sydney), she has shared the stage with such legends as The Hollywood Ten,\u00a0Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary,\u00a0Gary Snyder, and Alice Coltrane. In the 80s, L.A.\u2019s music underground welcomed Coleman as she appeared with Henry Rollins, Lydia Lunch, and Exene Cervenka with whom she recorded\u00a0Twin Sisters.\nAfter some 40 years of writing Coleman remains devoted exploring racism, female experience, and Los Angeles. She summarized her complex love-hate relationship with her birthplace by stating that when she visited other places, she \u201cfinds Los Angeles has been there before I arrive.\u201d Coleman added: \u201cWords seem inadequate in expressing the anger and outrage I feel at the persistent racism that permeates every aspect of black American life. Since words are what I am best at, I concern myself with this as an urban actuality as best I can.\u201d The city has been a vital part of her writings and an important outlet for her poetry readings. Coleman, said poet Juan Felipe Herrera, was the \u201cword-caster of live coals of Watts & L.A.\u201d\u00a0\nColeman died in 2013 following a long illness.\nIn 2020, a newly relaunched Black Sparrow Press brought out Coleman's Wicked Enchantment: Selected Poems as their inaugural title. Edited and introduced by Terrance Hayes, the collection draws from four decades of Coleman's work and includes many pieces from her \"American Sonnet\" series. The book was widely praised by critics. Writing in The New Yorker, Dan Chiasson called Coleman\u00a0\u201cOne of the greatest poets ever to come out of L.A.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
