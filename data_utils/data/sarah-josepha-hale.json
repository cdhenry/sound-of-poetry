For nearly 50 years she edited an extremely popular women\u2019s magazine.Born in Newport, New Hampshire, Hale was schooled at home and later by her husband. Widowed with five children, she attempted a literary career to support her family. She published The Genius of Oblivion and Other Original Poems (1823) anonymously with financial support from friends. While her early poetry was warmly received, serious recognition came with the publication of her novel Northwood: A Tale of New England (1827).\nIn 1828 Hale moved to Boston, where she exerted enormous influence as editor of Ladies\u2019 Magazine, a ground-breaking journal of prose and poetry. In 1837 Louis A. Godey bought the magazine, renaming it Godey\u2019s Lady Book. As the publication\u2019s fame increased, Hale remained editor and moved to Philadelphia, where she promoted women\u2019s writing by soliciting and publishing female writers.\nA high-profile supporter in the early 1860s of Vassar College\u2019s efforts to provide an elite education to women, Hale believed in women\u2019s schooling and property rights. As the women\u2019s rights movement grew, however, she remained opposed to women\u2019s suffrage and involvement in business.Hale published dozens of books of poetry, fiction, nonfiction, drama, and recipes. Her titles include Poems for Our Children (1830); Three Hours; or, The Vigil of Love: and Other Poems (1848); Love; or, Woman\u2019s Destiny. A Poem in Two Parts: With Other Poems (1870); and Woman\u2019s Record; or, Sketches of All Distinguished Women, from \u201cThe Beginning\u201d till A.D. 1850 (1853), the first book to record women writers.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
