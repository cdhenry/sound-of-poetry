He earned a BA at Castleton State College.\nSwinburne has published more than 25 books for children, many of which are based on explorations of the natural environment, including Safe in a Storm (2016), Sea Turtle Scientist (2014), Guess Whose Shadow? (2002), and Unbeatable Beaks (1999). He is also the author of the young adult novel series Wiff and Dirty George.\nSwinburne\u2019s books of poetry for children, including Ocean Soup: Tide Pool Poems (2010) and Safe, Warm, and Snug (2002, illustrated by Jose Aruego and Ariane Dewey), mix humor with interesting facts about animal life. In a 2010 interview with Patricia Stohr-Hunt for her blog The Miss Rumphius Effect, Swinburne shares why he likes to use humor in his poems for children: \u201cIf a funny line or unusual image can turn kids onto critters such as sea urchins and Surinam toads and bowerbirds, I\u2019m happy. With awareness, comes an urgency to safeguard and protect. I want to encourage an army of wildlife safekeepers. But I also get a real kick from making kids laugh.\u201d\nSwinburne lives in South Londonderry, Vermont.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
