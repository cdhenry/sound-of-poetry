She attended UCLA and the University of California, Berkeley. Guest moved to New York City in the 1940s and rose to prominence in the late 1950s as a member of an informal group of writers known as the New York school of poets whose membership included Frank O\u2019Hara, John Ashbery, and James Schuyler. Their innovative approach to poetry was influenced by modern art, especially surrealism and abstract expressionism. Guest drew on her own background in art (she worked for Art News magazine in the 1950s) to create poetry that Tyrus Miller in Contemporary Poets described as a tension-filled balance between \u201ca lyric, or purely musical, impulse; and a graphic or painterly impulse.\u201d Guest eventually moved away from these early influences; her later works are more in line with the language poets, whose primary interest is the actual word and not so much the image it evokes. \u201cMy poems tend more to language than to ideas,\u201d Guest told American Poetry Review\u2019s Mark Hillringhouse. Apart from her poetry collections, Guest\u2019s works include the novel Seeking Air (1978) and Herself Defined (1984), the biography of the Imagist poet H.D. (Hilda Doolittle). She also published collections of nonfiction writing and essays on poetics including the collection Forces of Imagination: Writing on Writing (2003). Some of Guest\u2019s works were collaborations with other artists, including Richard Tuttle and June Felter, in which words and drawings combine to form a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Anthony Manousos in Dictionary of Literary Biography summarized Guest\u2019s poetry as \u201curbane, cosmopolitan, and refined\u201d and suggestive of \u201cthe psychological dislocations and restless imagination of the perpetual traveler.\u201d\n\r\nGuest\u2019s interest in poetry developed while she was a college student in California, but flourished only after she had relocated to New York, which she told Hillringhouse \u201cseemed like civilization [after] coming from the West Coast.\u201d Guest found acceptance in the thriving New York City art scene of the 1950s, and as she told Hillringhouse, \u201cI began to believe in my poetry, in its future.\u201d Her influences ranged from the artists Jackson Pollock and Tony Smith to the writers Henry Miller (an acquaintance from California who suggested she move to New York) and Dorothy Richardson. Though she acknowledged the influence of the \u201cgestural freedom\u201d of abstract expressionism on her early work, she told Hillringhouse that she does not see this as a prominent motivation in later work. Poets, not artists, tended to be Guest\u2019s influences; she named the French poet Anne Marie Albiach as \u201cone of the finest writing poetry today,\u201d and she once admitted to Contemporary Authors, \u201cI drag my coattails in the dust of the Russian poets Akamatova and Mandelstam.\u201d Criticizing the current prominence of \u201cpostmodern\u201d art and lamenting the \u201cdecline of painting today\u201d in the interview with Hillringhouse, Guest claimed that poetry \u201cis the most interesting art form right now\u201d because of its mission to expand the \u201cmodern tradition.\u201d\n\r\nGuest\u2019s interest in the history of Imagism prompted her to write Herself Defined: The Poet H. D. and Her World, the biography of the original Imagist poet. Imagism developed in the years following World War I and is much less structured than poetry of the previous generation. Marked by a free-verse prose and succinct, vivid images, Imagism was popularized in Europe primarily through H. D., her husband Richard Aldington, and Ezra Pound. Through her access to unpublished documents, Guest painted a portrait of Hilda Doolittle, the woman that Pound\u2014Doolittle\u2019s childhood sweetheart\u2014called \u201ca tree-born spirit of the wood.\u201d Guest related to Hillringhouse the significance of undertaking such an ambitious project: \u201cIt was an event in my life to enter another life, a dangerous event.\u201d Not only was writing a detailed biography an informative experience, but it also forced Guest to be more disciplined writer. \u201cI learned to keep writing,\u201d she told Hillringhouse. The book took Guest five years to complete; she collected her reflections of the experience in a group of poems entitled Biography (1981)\n\r\nIn Herself Defined, Guest explored H. D.\u2019s reputation as a muse-like character amid a prolific literary circle that included such notables as D. H. Lawrence, Sigmund Freud, and William Carlos Williams. Of special interest to Guest was H. D.\u2019s unconventional forty-year relationship with the charismatic heiress, benefactor, and writer who called herself Bryher. Herself Defined attracted attention from critics who sought an interpretation of H. D.\u2019s writings as well as those interested in H. D.\u2019s reputation as one of the more flamboyant figures of her generation. Noting the influential circle of poets in which H. D. moved, Michiko Katutani of the New York Times wrote that \u201cGuest weaves these relationships and others into a shimmering, delicately patterned narrative that is never less than absorbing.\u201d\n\r\nGabriel Pearson in Times Literary Supplement praised the biography as an \u201cengaging and fluent study\u2026 of [H. D.\u2019s] movements, milieux and relationships.\u201d H. D. \u201cemerges not as an idealized figure,\u201d wrote Kay Larrieu in Best Sellers of Guest\u2019s portrait, \u201cbut as a more believable paradox\u201d; a woman who was dependent on others but desired to be alone to write and who relied on men to protect her, but had sexual relationships with women. Reviewing the book for Ms., Marion Meade said that Guest \u201chas done an impressive job of collecting and sorting the facts, year by year, neurosis by neurosis.\u201d\n\r\nGuest\u2019s first novel, Seeking Air, is an experimental \u201ccollage novel, written in journal form\u201d according to Manousos. In Seeking Air, the hero, Morgan Flew, fails to bring the events of his life and the actions of those around him (mainly his lover, Miriam) under his control. Guest cited her primary influence for the work as Dorothy Richardson\u2019s The Pilgrimage; she adopted Richardson\u2019s use of stream of consciousness writing, and named her heroine \u201cMiriam\u201d after Richardson\u2019s dental assistant protagonist. Time, place, and voice are elusive in the novel, and traditional narrative boundaries are disregarded. Kathleen Fraser in Breaking the Sequence: Women\u2019s Experimental Fiction called the novel \u201cantinarrative,\u201d noting that its frame is \u201cstructural/Cubist\u201d with language that is \u201ca contrast of almost nineteenth-century formality and limpidity.\u201d Guest explained to Hillringhouse that the novel is \u201can account of what happens every day in New York City, and about Paris, and what somebody is thinking while looking out a window, and about memory, about the collusion of ideas, about coincidence, the brevity of ideas, about time, disorder, flux, etc.\u201d\n\r\nThe volume of poetry Fair Realism (1988) reveals Guest\u2019s painterly nature, according to American Poetry Review contributor David Shapiro, who noted Guest\u2019s \u201cacute sense of landscape and landscape painting.\u201d These are poems \u201csuffused with a classical sense of history, literature, and mystical import,\u201d commented Jessica Grim in Library Journal. Robert Long in his Southampton Press review of the Fair Realism praised Guest\u2019s \u201cstunning lyricism, her ability to leave everything out of a poem but the essential\u2026 The silences in Guest\u2019s poems are as important as the sound.\u201d Commenting on the twenty-two page poem \u201cTuerler Losses\u201d in which a poet laments the loss of two valuable wristwatches, Long summarized that \u201cthere is not other contemporary poet who has assembled this wide a range of effects, these different kind of \u2018musicality\u2019 and this visual variety into a single poem of such length and has made it hang together.\u201d\n\r\nReinforcing Guest\u2019s association with the language poets, Manousos claimed that Guest\u2019s poetry is for \u201cthose who are moved by the play of language for its own sake.\u201d Guest once told Contemporary Authors that she considers \u201cAmerican poets in their forties and fifties and in particular women poets (without being a feminist in literature)\u2026 to be writing the finest poetry today.\u201d Shapiro lauded Guest as a poet distinguished in both \u201clyric and critical prose,\u201d as well \u201cas an important precursor of the \u2018Language\u2019 poets.\u201d Shapiro continued, \u201cWhen one looks at work Barbara Guest accomplished in the late 1950s and early 1960s, one finds pieces that often seem to have been written yesterday, if not tomorrow.\u201d\nBarbara Guest lived in Berkeley and died in 2006.\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["New York School"]}}
