He attended Eton and Balliol College, Oxford where he excelled academically and was elected a Fellow of All Souls College. Associated with the socialite and aristocrat Lady Diana Cooper, Shaw-Stewart was part of her \u201ccorrupt coterie\u201d and wrote her many intimate letters full of erotic allusions to Greek and Latin literature. Shaw-Stewart joined the army in 1914 and served with Rupert Brooke; he was even present at Brooke\u2019s burial in Skyros. While known as a \u201cwar poet,\u201d Shaw-Stewart wrote only one poem, \u201cI saw a man this morning,\u201d which was penned in a period of rest before fighting at Gallipoli and published after his death. The poem contains allusions to Greek literature, notably Homer\u2019s Iliad. Shaw-Stewart was killed in France in 1917 and buried at Metz-en-Couture.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Wales"]}}
