He earned his BA from Alfred University, his MA from the University of Chicago, and then entered the University of Iowa for an MFA. A decorated teacher at the University of Iowa from 1965 to 2005, he taught such writers as Rita Dove, John Irving, and Joy Harjo. He won numerous honors for his work and was named Iowa\u2019s first poet laureate in 2000. William M. Robins has written that Bell \u201cis a poet of the family. He writes of his father, his wives, his sons, and himself in a dynamic interaction of love and loss, accomplishment, and fear of alienation. These are subjects that demand maturity and constant evaluation. A complete reading of Bell\u2019s canon shows his ability to understand the durability of the human heart. Equally impressive is his accompanying technical sophistication.\u201d Bell died at the age of 83 on December 14, 2020.\n\r\nBell was the author of over 20 volumes of poetry, including\u00a0Incarnate: The Collected Dead Man Poems (2019), Vertigo: The Living Dead Man Poems (2011), A Primer about the Flag (2011), Days, 1 Book (2009), Mars Being Red (2007), and Rampant (2004). His second collection, A Probable Volume of Dreams (1969), opens with a poem addressed to the poet\u2019s father, initiating a dialogue that continues throughout Bell\u2019s works. \u201cAlthough Bell is never narrowly confessional, it is important to note just how much the death of the father\u2014his profound absence and presence\u2014helps shape Bell\u2019s poetry and create possible worlds.\u00a0The\u00a0father: Bell\u2019s own dead father, and his growing sense of himself as a father who has sons and who, like him, will someday die,\u201d wrote Arthur Oberg in\u00a0American Poetry Review.\u00a0In addition to this motif, the poems \u201ctell how unlinear life and art are, how \u2018progress\u2019 is a deception of the nineteenth century, how increasingly distant the finishing line for the poet-runner proves to be,\u201d Oberg observed.\u00a0A Probable Volume of Dreams\u00a0won the Lamont Award from the Academy of American Poets.\nBell\u2019s concern with the self and its relationships, a focus of his earlier poetry, gradually gave way to reflections on the self in relation to nature in books such as\u00a0Stars Which See, Stars Which Do Not See. Speaking of this development to Wayne Dodd and\u00a0Stanley Plumly\u00a0in an\u00a0Ohio Review\u00a0interview, Bell noted that attention to nature has always been an integral part of his life. He grew up among farmers; his inspiration was not the 1960s back-to-nature movement. His first work came from his interest \u201cin what language could make all by itself. \u2026 And I was interested in relationships between people. I wrote one whole book of poems-in-series about the relationships between a couple of people, or among several people. But now, for whatever good reasons, I\u00a0am\u00a0interested in allowing nature to have the place in my poems that it always had in my life.\u201d\n\r\nFor Bell, the change in subject matter signaled a change in attitude, both personal and cultural. He once explained, \u201cContemporary American poetry has been tiresome in its discovery of the individual self, over and over and over, and its discovery of emotions that, indeed, we all have: loneliness, fear, despair, ennui, etcetera. I think it can get tiresome when the discovery of such emotions is more or less all the content there is to a poem. We know these things. \u2026 So I sort of write poetry nowadays from some other attitudes, I think, that came upon me without my ever really thinking about them. I think, for example, that it\u2019s ultimately pleasanter and healthier and better for everyone if one thinks of the self as being very small and very unimportant. \u2026 And I think, as I may not always have thought, that the only way out of the self is to concentrate on others and on things outside the self.\u201d\n\r\nBell sometimes referred to this development as an achievement of poetic modesty. He told Dodd and Plumly, \u201cThere is a kind of physical reality that we all share a sense of. I mean, we might argue about what reality is, but we all know how to walk across a bridge\u2014instead of walking across the water, for instance. And it seems to me that one definition of modesty in poetry would be a refusal to compromise the physical facts of what it is that is showing up in one\u2019s poems,\u201d Bell explained.\n\r\nSpeaking of his personal aesthetic, he told the interviewers, \u201cI would like to write poetry which finds salvation in the physical world and the here and now and which defines the soul, if you will, in terms of emotional depth, and that emotional depth in terms of the physical world and the world of human relationships.\u201d Regarding style, he added, \u201cI\u2019d like to write a poetry which has little if any insistence about it, as little as possible. I would like to write a poetry which doesn\u2019t seem either to button-hole the reader, or demand too much allegiance, or demand that too much of the world be given up for the special world of the poem.\u201d\n\r\nReviewers have argued that Bell\u2019s more recent poems fulfill these aspirations.\u00a0G.E. Murray, writing in the\u00a0Georgia Review,\u00a0remarked, \u201cI am impressed by this poet\u2019s increasing ability to perceive and praise small wonders. There is life and health in \u2026 [his verse], and if sometimes Bell\u2019s expression is quiet and reserved, his talent is not. Altogether,\u00a0Stars Which See, Stars Which Do Not See\u00a0demonstrates an important transitional phase for the poet\u2014a subdued, graceful vein that enables him to \u2018speak of eyes and seasons\u2019 with an intimacy and surehandedness that informs and gratifies. \u2026 I believe Marvin Bell is on a track of the future\u2014a mature, accessible and personalized venture into the mainstream of contemporary American verse.\u201d Of the same book,\u00a0David St. John\u00a0wrote in\u00a0Parnassus, \u201cMany poets have tried to appropriate into their poems a gritty, tough-talking American character, and to thereby earn for themselves some \u2026 \u2018authenticity\u2019. \u2026 In\u00a0Stars Which See, Stars Which Do Not See,\u00a0Bell has found within his\u00a0own\u00a0voice that American voice, and with it the ability to write convincingly about the smallest details of a personal history.\u201d\n\r\nCritics have admired Bell\u2019s blending of precise descriptive powers with deceptively simple grammar and syntax in his later works. In reviewing\u00a0These Green-Going-to-Yellow,\u00a0Richard Jackson wrote in the\u00a0American Book Review\u00a0that Bell\u2019s strategy of deploying words and phrases in unusual contexts has resulted in \u201can increasingly expansive and colloquial language that is willing to gather in larger fragments of the world without the \u2018new critical\u2019 necessity of neatly tying each bit together on the surface of the text.\u201d The poet\u2019s linguistic maturity has also been singled out in discussions of the 1987 anthology,\u00a0New and Selected Poems.\u00a0For several critics, the less private and self-referential later poetry contained in this volume has made Bell one of the most arresting of contemporary writers. A Poetry reviewer noted that Bell \u201cis a discreet master of withheld information. His writing has a distinctive enough flavor to make us feel we know him well after turning the last page of this book; but \u2026 of the events and circumstances of his life the poems say very little directly.\u201d And a contributor to\u00a0American Poetry Review\u00a0related: \u201cIt is Bell\u2019s later poetry, far less private and solipsistic, and far more abundantly intelligent and astonishing [than his earlier poetry,] that has made him one of the best poets now working.\u201d\n\r\nThe subsequent collection,\u00a0Nightworks: Poems 1962-2000,\u00a0further allows readers to trace Bell\u2019s growth, remarked a\u00a0Publishers Weekly\u00a0reviewer. \u00a0\u201cThis selection shows a poet progressing to the peak of his powers,\u201d they wrote. The text, which contains selections from\u00a0A Probable Volume of Dreams,\u00a0The Escape into You,\u00a0and\u00a0Stars Which See, Stars Which Do Not See,\u00a0among others, highlights subjects consistent throughout Bell\u2019s body of work. Poems included in this collection touch on the death of Bell\u2019s father, his Jewish identity, his experiences in the military, and his relationships with his wives and children. In an article for the\u00a0North Stone Review,\u00a0James Naiden noted that\u00a0Nightworks places Bell within a poetic tradition. \u201cWhile the \u2018father poems\u2019 and poems otherwise exhuming the past, as it were, illustrate the incantatory ghosts in Bell\u2019s oeuvre,\u201d wrote Naiden, \u201cthere are also acknowledgments to his prolific forebears, such as\u00a0William Stafford\u00a0\u2026 and, of course,\u00a0Emily Dickinson.\u201d These and other \u201ckindred poets \u2026 provide clarity to [Bell\u2019s] voice by their own leave-taking, the offering of a poet to give voice where otherwise there is silence.\u201d In addition, the poems in the collection strike a balance between what Naiden termed \u201ccommon experience\u201d and Bell\u2019s personal history, as well as his connections to others. In her\u00a0North Stone Review\u00a0assessment of Bell\u2019s\u00a0The Book of the Dead Man,\u00a0Carol Ellis similarly remarked that in the interplay between Bell\u2019s \u201cOdysseus,\u201d the dead man, and nature, \u201ccommunion creates community,\u201d emphasizing that \u201cthe dead man is in a state of constant knowing because he is never out of touch with the world.\u201d\n\r\nBell\u2019s use of humor developed over time. \u201cHumor in the fifteen new poems contained in\u00a0New and Selected Poems\u00a0is of the sort that deflates our facile reductions of experience,\u201d observed an essayist for\u00a0Contemporary Poets. \u201cMarvin Bell\u2019s work satisfies a need for every kind of laugh and reminds us that comedy is at least as tough as tragedy. From the outset, however, he has been modulating the balance of amusement and profundity in his poetry. Early on his wit was, by turns, clever and probing, tending at one moment to trivialize his work, at another to deepen it. But over the long haul he has exerted mature control.\u201d\n\r\nIn 1994 Bell published what some reviewers regard as his most radical work,\u00a0The Book of the Dead Man,\u00a0which consists of a sequence of 33 poems on various facets of life, narrated by the anonymous title character. Stan Sanvel Rubin wrote in\u00a0Prairie Schooner\u00a0that Bell has fashioned in this work \u201ca dazzling linguistic Chinese box, at once alluring and elusive, which shows up for once and for all (maybe) the emptiness of \u2018Language Poetry\u2019 and, in fact, much recent experimental and postmodern writing.\u201d Bruce Murphy\u00a0averred in\u00a0Poetry\u00a0that \u201cBell is really out there\u2014trying to invent a new kind of poetry, something like an epic with only one character.\u201d Richard Jackson, in an appraisal for the\u00a0North American Review,\u00a0termed\u00a0The Book of the Dead Man \u201cone of the most complex, most original books in a long time.\u201d Jackson added that Bell deals with both internal and external forces but does not see them as necessarily separate: \u201cThe counterpointed vision also means that to talk about the cosmos is to talk about the self and its tiniest sensations, to talk about government is to talk about the self\u2019s needs\u2014one thing is always seen in contrast to several other things.\u201d The critic concluded, \u201cWhat\u00a0The Book of the Dead Man\u00a0does, by its verbal pyrotechnics, is redefine sensibility, and this is the most essential thing any poetry can do. \u2026 This is an astounding feat. There\u2019s not a greater gift any poet or poetry can bring.\u201d In\u00a0Ardor: The Book of the Dead Man, Volume Two,\u00a0Bell continues in a similar mode, darkly rendering what a\u00a0Publishers Weekly contributor described as \u201cthe thin line that separates the real from the unreal, the illuminated from the dim, the living from the dead.\u201d Bell\u2019s recent collections include Vertigo: The Living Dead Man Poems (2011), the collaboratively-written 7\u00a0Poets, 4 Days, 1 Book (2009), and Mars Being Red (2007).\n\r\nBell\u2019s volume of essays,\u00a0Old Snow Just Melting: Essays and Interviews,\u00a0is concerned with themes typical of the author\u2019s poetic works, particularly mutability and decay.\u00a0Virginia Quarterly Review\u00a0contributor Thomas Swiss commended Bell\u2019s prose, saying Bell \u201cwrites with style: clean, metaphoric prose that\u2019s readable and instructive. He writes simply without condescending and without ignoring the complexity of the issues he examines.\u201d The volume also presents valuable insights into the author\u2019s poetic process. Bell writes, as quoted by Swiss, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you right now the secrets of writing poetry. \u2026 First, one learns to write by reading. \u2026 Number two, I believe that language, compared to the materials of other art forms, has only one thing going for it: the ability to be precise. \u2026 And the third and most important secret is that, if you do anything seriously for a long time, you get better at it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
