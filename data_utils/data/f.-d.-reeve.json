Reeve authored more than 30 books, including 11 collections of poems, a half-dozen novels, multiple critical works, Russian translations, and plays. He abandoned an early acting career, afraid that he \u201cas a person who wanted to write poetry, would have to give up too much of my inner self for a stage career.\u201d After earning his doctorate in Russian from Columbia University, he went on to teach Slavic languages and English literature at Wesleyan University for 40 years, occasionally taking up visiting professorships at Oxford, Columbia, and Yale. \u00a0 Reeve was an officer of the Poetry Society of America, and a secretary of Poets House. He was the recipient of the New England Poetry Club\u2019s Golden Rose Award, an Award in Literature from the American Academy National Institute of Arts and Letters, and a D.Lit from New England College. Reeve served as Robert Frost\u2019s translator and cultural ambassador on a 1962 trip to the USSR during the Cold War, documenting the experience in Robert Frost in Russia (1964, 2001). \u00a0 A firm believer that poetry can bestow truth, Reeve argued in an interview that poetry transcends other information-relaying media, such as advertisements and news broadcasts. He contended that poetry maintains the purity of language. Reeve\u2019s intimate relationship to translation is apparent in his ideas of how poems work. Of the difficulty in preserving truth across languages and eras, he said, \u201cThere are important forms in languages that don\u2019t readily adapt to expression in our language, but there are ways around such \u2018obstacles.\u2019 It all depends on how honest we want to be with what our thoughts are, how skilled we can be at extending our contemporary language. The ancient world was as much a combination of peoples as the world is now.\u201d \u00a0 Reeve died in 2013 at the age of 84.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
