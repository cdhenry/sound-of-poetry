Jones\u2019s poems are spare yet meditative; the\u00a0Village Voice, reviewing\u00a0Apropos of Nothing, observed, \u201cJones can be stunning, effortlessly finding the right tone. This is instinctive poetry, combining bluntness with reserve.\u201d\n\r\nJones\u2019s poetry appears in many anthologies, including\u00a0Poetry 180\u00a0and Good Poems, as well as in journals such as Poetry magazine, AGNI, Image, American Poetry Review, Literature and Belief, Narrative, and Escape into Life.

He is also the curator of \u201cThe Poet\u2019s Almanac,\u201d a free, world-wide app that analyzes the weather report and couples it with\u00a0Poetry East\u2019s\u00a0customized archive to create a new way for users to discover and engage with poetry every day. \u00a0In recent years, the journal has balanced contemporary art and poetry alongside enduring works by masters in a series devoted to the world\u2019s great cities\u2014London, Paris, Kyoto, Rome, Barcelona, and the forthcoming Dublin. Having edited Poetry East for nearly 40 years, in 2020 he will publish the journal\u2019s 100th volume.\nJones teaches at DePaul University in Chicago and lives north of the city with his family.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
