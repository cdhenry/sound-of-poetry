Nemerov was born in New York, New York to an artistically inclined family: his younger sister was photographer Diane Arbus. He earned his BA from Harvard and served in World War II as a pilot and first lieutenant in the U.S. Army Air Force\u2019s Royal Canadian unit. Returning to the United States, Nemerov embarked on a long and distinguished teaching career, first at Hamilton College and then at institutions including Bennington College, Brandeis University, and Washington University in St. Louis, where he was professor and poet-in-residence from 1969 to 1990. Nemerov\u2019s many collections of poetry, fiction, and prose, as well as his work as an editor made him a major figure in mid-century American poetry. Though his works showed a consistent emphasis on thought\u2014the process of thinking and ideas themselves\u2014his poems related a broad spectrum of emotion and a variety of concerns. As Joyce Carol Oates remarked in the New Republic, \u201cRomantic, realist, comedian, satirist, relentless and indefatigable brooder upon the most ancient mysteries\u2014Nemerov is not to be classified.\u201d Writing in the study Howard Nemerov, Peter Meinke pointed out that Nemerov spoke of a duality in his nature in Journal of the Fictive Life in which he said that \u201cit has seemed to me that I must attempt to bring together the opposed elements of my character represented by poetry and fiction.\u201d Commented Meinke, \u201cThese \u2018opposed elements\u2019 in Howard Nemerov\u2019s character are reflected in his life and work: in the tensions between his romantic and realistic visions, his belief and unbelief, his heart and mind.\u201d\n\r\nIf Nemerov harbored impulses toward both poetry and fiction, he expressed them as opposites suspended in balanced co-existence rather than dissonance. His many works of poetry included Guide to Ruins (1950); The Salt Garden (1955); The Winter Lightning; Selected Poems (1968); The Collected Poems of Howard Nemerov (1977), winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the Bollingen Priz; Sentences (1980); and Trying Conclusions: New and Selected Poems 1961-1991 (1991), among others. Writing in the American modernist tradition of poets such as T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden, W. B. Yeats, and Wallace Stevens, Nemerov\u2019s early work was sometimes described as derivative. Randall Jarrell found that \u201cyou can see where he found out how to do some of the things he does\u2014he isn\u2019t, as yet, a very individual poet.\u201d Years later, when asked if his work had changed in character or style, Nemerov replied in Poets on Poetry, \u201cIn style\u2026 for I began and for a long time remained imitative, and poems in my first books\u2026 show more than traces of admired modern masters\u2014Eliot, Auden, Stevens, [E. E.] Cummings, Yeats.\u201d Meinke, too, maintained that Nemerov in his early work was \u201cwriting Eliot, Yeats, and Stevens out of his system.\u201d Yet even Jarrell commented that \u201cas you read The Salt Garden you are impressed with how much the poet has learned, how well he has developed,\u201d while Hayden Carruth remarked, \u201cNemerov\u2019s new book is his third\u2026 and his best; steady improvement, I take it, is one sign of formidable ability.\u201d\nThe Salt Garden marked other changes in Nemerov\u2019s work as he increasingly opened his poetry to consideration of the natural world. In 1966, Nemerov wrote in Poets on Poetry of the impact of the natural world on his work: \u201cDuring the war and since, I have lived in the country, chiefly in Vermont, and while my relation to the landscape has been contemplative rather than practical, the landscape nevertheless has in large part taken over my poetry.\u201d Frequently compared to Robert Frost, Nemerov likewise brought philosophical issues into his poetry. As he said in Poets on Poetry, he was not so much an observer of nature as its medium, bringing into speech \u201can unknowably large part of a material world whose independent existence might be likened to that of the human unconscious, a sleep of causes, a chaos of the possible-impossible.\u201d\nA feature of the poems more frequently pointed out by critics is a witty, ironic manner and a serious, perhaps pessimistic, philosophy. James Dickey observed the seriousness that underlies Nemerov\u2019s wit. Nemerov, Dickey maintained, \u201cis one of the wittiest and funniest poets we have\u2026 But the enveloping emotion that arises from his writing is helplessness: the helplessness we all feel in the face of the events of our time, and of life itself\u2026 And beneath even this feeling is a sort of hopelessly involved acceptance and resignation which has in it more of the truly tragic than most poetry which deliberately sets out in quest of tragedy.\u201d Not all critics applauded the tragic irony which Dickey and many others have found in Nemerov\u2019s poetry. Carruth, for example, commented: \u201cNo one would deny that famous and marvelous poems have been written in the manner of poetic irony\u2026 But today this manner is an exceedingly tired poetic attitude\u2026 And Nemerov\u2019s tired attitude is revealed in tired poetry: spent meters, predictable rhymes, and metaphors haggard with use.\u201d However strong his ironic voice, Nemerov mellowed with age, according to many reviewers. Helen Vendler discerned in a critique of Collected Poems that as \u201cthe echoes of the grand maitres fade, the poems get steadily better. The severity of attitude is itself chastened by a growing humanity, and the forms of the earth grow ever more distinct.\u201d\nThe Collected Poems of Howard Nemerov presented verse from all of the earlier volumes and its publication in 1977 spurred a re-evaluation of Nemerov\u2019s work. Phoebe Pettingell noted in the New Leader that the book showed \u201ca gradual intensifying of a unified perspective,\u201d the poet\u2019s obsession with the theme of \u201cman\u2019s sometimes tragic, sometimes ludicrous relation to history, death and the universe.\u201d Robert B. Shaw, writing in the Nation, related, \u201cTo what extent, he repeatedly wonders, is the world we see our own creation?... Is the poem a mirror reflecting the appearances of the world in responsible detail, or is it a window, a transparent medium through which we may see\u2026? Or might it begin in one and with care and luck become the other? Nemerov never fully unravels these aesthetic and metaphysical knots. They provide him the material for endless reflection.\u201d Tom Johnson offered this assessment in the Sewanee Review: \u201cNemerov has written more incisively of science and its place in our imaginations than anyone else has yet managed to do in good (or even readable) poems\u2026 The breadth of accomplishment and depth of insight are one\u2019s most striking impressions from first readings of the Collected Poems, enriched later by the humor, in intricacy, the grace.\u201d Shaw recommended Collected Poems to readers whose interest in poetry stems more from curiosity than from experience with the genre. \u201cSuch readers,\u201d Shaw said, \u201ccan expect to be charmed by the easy flow of Nemerov\u2019s reasoned discourse, and moved by those fine moments in his poems in which reason is overcome by awe.\u201d\n\r\nSeveral reviewers also found much of value in Trying Conclusions: New and Selected Poems, 1961-1991, published the year of Nemerov\u2019s death. Sidney Burris, writing in the Southern Review, found the collection significant because, in addition to containing a dozen new poems, it provided an excellent selection of Nemerov\u2019s work beginning with The Next Room of the Dream, with Collected Poems containing much of the poet\u2019s earlier output and therefore functioning as a \u201ccompanion volume.\u201d Burris went on, \u201cThe poetry selected for Trying Conclusions issues from what Nemerov continually described as a simple respect for an audience who has\u2014or at least ought to have, he always added\u2014more pressing things to do than read his poems\u2026The deepest wish of Nemerov\u2019s poetry, particularly of the poems gathered together in Trying Conclusions, is that his poems aim ultimately to dignify the world of our recognizably common experience.\u201d Several reviewers also saw in the collection the humor and versatility frequently associated with Nemerov.\nNemerov\u2019s prose has also been commended, especially for displaying an irony and wit similar to that of his poems. His novels, as Meinke remarked, \u201clike his poems\u2026 are basically pessimistic. The condition of man is not an enviable one: we act foolishly and understand imperfectly. Nemerov\u2019s dark viewpoint, which in his poetry is redeemed by beauty\u2026 in his fiction is redeemed by humor.\u201d Through the characters in these novels, Nemerov explored \u201cthe consequences of the overactive imagination,\u201d wrote Carl Rapp in the Dictionary of Literary Biography: Novelists since World War II. Characters with romantic expectations of finding meaningful action and self-realization amid the social pressures of their times instead realize that they are the victims of their own fantasies. Thus, the novels, like the poetry, comment on the relationship between imagination and reality.\n\r\nNemerov published his last novel, The Homecoming Game (about a professor who discovers his limits when faced with opposing groups on campus), in 1957. Though through with the novel form, Nemerov continued to work with prose in short stories and literary criticism. Like his poetry and fiction, Nemerov\u2019s essays won him the respect of many well-known writers and critics. \u201cIt is the texture of [Nemerov\u2019s] thinking that is exhilarating, and not the Grand Propositions\u2014though one of the latter (his favorite) is sturdy indeed: \u2018Poetry is getting something right in language\u2019\u2026 The theoretical essays and the studies of particular writers are the ones most wealthy in serviceable lore,\u201d wrote Richard Wertime of Nemerov\u2019s New and Selected Essays in the Yale Review. Deborah S. Murphy and Gloria Young stated in the Contemporary Authors Bibliography Series that since \u201cNemerov is a poet who is continually changing and growing, becoming more complex in subject matter and apparently simpler in style,\u201d the body of his work has only begun to receive the serious critical attention it merits.\n\r\nSeveral of Nemerov\u2019s essays and works of fiction, along with a smattering of poems, were collected in 1991 into A Howard Nemerov Reader. Doug Anderson, writing in the New York Times Book Review, said the book would be valuable to those who know Nemerov only as a poet, as \u201chis fiction\u2026 allows him a much wider emotional and imaginative range than do his poems, and his essays\u2026 reveal Mr. Nemerov as brilliantly incisive, if occasionally curmudgeonly.\u201d And in Poetry, Robert B. Shaw pronounced, \u201cThis volume amply serves its purpose as an introduction to the spectrum of Nemerov\u2019s writing in its several forms.\u201d\n\r\nNemerov\u2019s books brought him many major awards for poetry, including the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1978, and the Bollingen Prize in 1981, all for The Collected Poems of Howard Nemerov. Regarding his fame, he told Jake Thompson of the Chicago Tribune, \u201cYou do the best you can and really don\u2019t worry about immortality all that much, especially as you have to be dead to achieve it\u2026 Oh, you want praise and recognition and above all money. But if that was your true motive, you would have done something else. All this fame and honor is a very nice thing, as long as you don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n", "attrs": {}}
