He then studied at the University of Wisconsin, where he earned a BA in 1924. Although he worked for a Chicago newspaper for a time, after 1924 he lived mostly in New York City, where he associated with other poets in Greenwich Village. His poetry collections include Stranger at Coney Island and Other Poems (1948), Collected Poems of Kenneth Fearing (1940), Dead Reckoning (1938), and Angel Arms (1929). He won a Guggenheim Fellowship for creative writing in 1936, and it was renewed in 1939.\nA well-known proletarian poet of the 1930s, a pulp magazine writer with several pseudonyms, and a Chicago and New York City publicity and editorial writer, Fearing turned to writing \u201cpsycho-thrillers\u201d in the 1940s and 1950s. His fourth novel The Big Clock (1946) achieved much popularity and was released as a film by Paramount in 1947. Although some scholars now consider Fearing\u2019s main contribution to be in the genre of poetry, the 1980 paperback republication of The Big Clock represents mystery buffs\u2019 recognition of the novel as a classic. Some contemporary critics found that Fearing\u2019s multiple first-person narrators detracted from the plots of his novels, but this technique allowed Fearing to probe the minds of both the pursued and the pursuers. His depiction of the atmosphere and vernacular of the city, which he first captured in his poetry, is in the style of the hard-boiled school of detective fiction, which Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, among others, had developed in the 1920s and 1930s.\nAlthough both his novels and his poetry depict the disintegration of middle-class life-styles in an urban mechanized society, Fearing described the conditions that led to the formulation of revolutionary ideas rather than advocating the ideas themselves. He developed in his poetry a persona of the reluctant private investigator who asked rather than answered questions, a persona who became one narrator in Fearing\u2019s novels.\nFearing considered Carl Sandburg and Walt Whitman the main models for his poetry; his poems also resemble those of E.E. Cummings. His short lines, internal rhymes, coined words, and street jargon make his lines abrupt and staccato, a style he later adapted for his novels, along with the city setting of such poems as \u201cManhattan.\u201d In this setting, violence is commonplace, and his many characters pathetic types. Although some contemporary critics called Fearing leftist and communist, Fearing stated that political convictions were a \u201cmystery\u201d to him. He is praised today for his presentation of the desperate lot of the urban middle and lower class, expressed in their own respective vernaculars.\nIn Fearing\u2019s first novel, The Hospital (1939), he introduced the narrative technique that he used in all of his subsequent novels: each chapter is narrated from the first-person point of view of one of the many characters. In The Hospital, all the chapters take place around three o\u2019clock in the afternoon and are narrated by the doctors, nurses, patients, and maintenance men in a huge metropolitan hospital. Fearing\u2019s first wife was a nurse, and Fearing visited city hospitals to research his novel. The reader sees what each character is doing and feeling in a few minutes after a drunken janitor turns the power off. Steve, an unemployed ship\u2019s radio operator is married to the faithless Freya, who is undergoing a biopsy for breast cancer at three o\u2019clock. At the same time, Steve\u2019s mistress Helen is being tested for tuberculosis. If her lump proves malignant, Freya has resolved to stay with Steve; if Helen has tuberculosis, Helen will free him. Other characters who undergo crises at three o\u2019clock are Dr. Gavin, a once brilliant, now terminally ill, surgeon who is mercifully killed by a colleague; Dr. Kane, who commits suicide because of a financial scandal; Dr. Cavanaugh, whose past surgical failures panic him while he operates on Freya; Dr. Clayborn, who tests Helen; and Pop Jarneck, who turns off all the switches in the hospital generator room at the moment Cavanaugh discovers that Freya does have cancer.\nReviewers charged that Fearing included too many narrators for readers to care for any of them, a criticism that would plague most of Fearing\u2019s novels. Switching narrators slowed down the action and gave the novel breadth without depth. However, the reviewers found Fearing\u2019s setting accurate and absorbing, and his \u201cbasement\u201d characters like Pop Jarneck sympathetic. The setting was enhanced by Fearing\u2019s concise, rhythmic style, so much so that one reviewer called the novel a \u201cstaccato prose poem.\u201d This crisp style along with the realistic treatment that Fearing gave his oppressed \u201cbasement\u201d characters earned this first novel a cautious but positive reception.\nAlthough in The Hospital Fearing used suspense to create interest in his characters, Dagger of the Mind (1941) is his first attempt to write a thriller. Following one trend in mystery writing that has continued to the present, Dagger in the Mind is a psychological thriller. \u201cNot so much a mystery story as a study in abnormal psychology,\u201d one reviewer called the novel. Fearing\u2019s techniques of switching first-person points of view allowed him to follow the pursuer, Captain Wessex of the New York State Police, and the pursued all the way to the solution of the crime and even to the electric chair. The setting is an artists\u2019 colony where all the residents have shady pasts and a murder occurs but not as the murderer originally planned. The narrators range from the murderer to the person about to be murdered to the investigator to the residents. The main narrator, Christopher Bartel, an alcoholic painter who is also the murderer, is an unreliable source of information because he lies to the reader. The many narrators sometimes interfere with the flow of action, and the ending is a disappointment because the solution is hidden from readers not by the cleverness of the puzzle but by the deception of the main narrator; however, the psychological suspense is an achievement. Although Fearing\u2019s chase scenes are presented through interior monologues that focus on states of mind rather than external events, they were exciting and unusual at a time when most thrillers depended on physical violence. The success and failures of Fearing\u2019s first thriller anticipated those of The Big Clock.\nClark Gifford\u2019s Body (1942), the story of a modern-day John Brown, confused readers and reviewers. 30 narrators tell about a revolution in a mythical country, which is initiated by Clark Gifford\u2019s attack on the radio station WLEX in Bonnfield. Gifford heads the Committee for Action, a group dissatisfied with the provisional government in power for the last five years. Although Gifford is captured during the attack and later is executed, the revolution succeeds. Gifford\u2019s bravery spurs his followers to overcome the government and establish an uneasy peace, but years later many consider him a madman. In a letter to his son, Gifford has warned that \u201cA man must value something, his beliefs, his country and its people, his personal honor, something, whatever it may be, so much that he is prepared to die for it if that should be necessary,\u201d but the chaos during the 30 years before the revolution is matched by that 15 years after Gifford\u2019s death. Fearing suggests the deterioration of Gifford\u2019s influence and the resulting chaos by the story of Tony, a child who, separated from his mother by war, lives with five or six different armies, speaks a language understood by no one, and can only imitate the actions of others. Tony\u2019s story is one of the few cases in which philosophical or historical commentary is embodied in the presentation of character. Fearing also uses contradictory newspaper and radio accounts of the attack on WLEX to represent the characters\u2019 confusion, a technique he returns to in The Crozart Story (1960). Fearing not only switches narrators with every chapter, but he also skips back and forth in time. Although some reviewers praised the novel as a warning of what might occur in the United States after World War II, Fearing\u2019s experimental narrative techniques not only confused and irritated readers but also made the novel too unreal and abstract to be frightening.\nThe title of The Big Clock refers to its main character\u2019s philosophy of life. The big clock, more powerful than man\u2019s watches and calendars, is the clock \u201cto which one automatically adjusts his entire life.\u201d Man runs like a mouse into all \u201cits false exits and dangerous blind alleys and steep runways, natural traps and artificial baits,\u201d looking for the \u201creal prize\u201d in life. That prize is an illusion, for the big clock \u201chas never changed, it will never change, or be changed.\u201d This lack of control pervades George Stroud\u2019s life; he is one step ahead of his lies to his wife and, by the end of the novel, one step from death. The suspense comes not from whether George will beat the big clock or fate (for no one can), but whether it is time for George or another to lose the race.\nGeorge is the editor of Crimeways magazine, a periodical that reports on, investigates, and even fabricates crimes. George has been successful as an investigator, and his life with his wife Georgette and daughter Georgia is stable despite his infidelities. Fearing portrays George\u2019s affair with his boss\u2019s mistress, Pauline Delos, as fated, and their first encounter is reminiscent of those sexual encounters in Chandler\u2019s and Hammett\u2019s novels: \u201cAll at once a whole lot of things were moving and mixing as though they had always been there.\u201d Although their relationship is charged with sexual tension, George tries to deny his romantic nature, as does Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe. \u201cThese moments [with women] move fast, if they are going to move at all, and with no superfluous nonsense. If they don\u2019t move, they die.\u201d The novel is far better than Fearing\u2019s previous books; not only does the brittle style support the characters\u2019 attitudes but also the psychological chase scene, in which George strives to elude his pursuers, is suspenseful until the end.\nWhen Earl Janoth kills Pauline Delos, George is the only witness. Janoth heads the organization that owns Crimeways as well as many other periodicals, but his life is \u201cashes,\u201d \u201ccold, and spent, and not quite worth the effort.\u201d He is part of the world that Fearing depicted in his early poetry, and the city itself is symbolized by the Janoth Building, which \u201cprefer[s] human sacrifices of the flesh and of the spirit.\u201d Both Janoth and Pauline are bisexual, a trait that Fearing used later in The Crozart Story to symbolize the degeneration of the rising middle class. Because Fearing again uses multiple first-person narrators, the reader sees the murder of Pauline through Janoth\u2019s eyes. Janoth knows someone saw him leave the murder scene but does not know it was George, and he assigns George, a skillful investigator, to find that witness\u2014George himself.\nThe reader knows that George cannot escape his own pursuit; the suspense comes from wondering how long he can avoid the investigators he has assigned to help in the search. Coincidence and minute details trap him. Janoth knows that his witness outbid the painter Louise Patterson for her own painting on the day Pauline died. Another Patterson painting hangs conspicuously in George\u2019s office. Investigators find George\u2019s handkerchief in a bar where \u201cthe witness\u201d had a drink with Pauline, and George must find an excuse to handle the handkerchief before they test it for fingerprints. The circle of evidence slowly builds around George, the pursuer and the pursued. George cannot tell the truth to the police without jeopardizing his marriage; Janoth must either kill the witness or pin the murder on him.\nAlthough Fearing has Janoth, George, Pauline, Georgette, Louise, and the investigators narrate chapters, he avoids the problems he had with this technique in the early novels. Because he uses George to tell the greater part of the story and because the plot proceeds in chronological order, the story is not obscured by shifting time sequences and changing points of view. Fearing also develops George\u2019s personality, making the reader care about George\u2019s predicament while showing his strengths and weaknesses. For example, he depicts George as a loving father by having him tell the story of the \u201clonely cornflake\u201d to his daughter so she will eat her cereal. However, although George says he has learned from his infidelities (\u201cIt was enough, to be scorched by one serious, near-disaster\u201d), the reader distrusts George\u2019s resolution to reform after he saves Louise Patterson\u2019s phone number.\nThe ending of the novel comes too easily for the suspense Fearing has created; George\u2019s own closing trap for \u201cthe witness,\u201d however, remains a master stroke. Contemporary reviewers found the chase scene \u201cgripping\u201d and \u201cunique,\u201d \u201cthe most unusual chase ever come across\u201d in the genre. Although the symbol of the big clock ties the novel together thematically\u2014fate misses George this time but will get him someday\u2014it does not support the action. The popularity of The Big Clock stems from its plot, the essence of all thrillers, and it drew more readers than Fearing\u2019s poetry or any of his other prose works.\nFearing next teamed up with Donald Friede and Henry Bedford-Jones to write the historical novel John Barry (1947) under the joint pseudonym Donald F. Bedford. Bedford-Jones, a prolific pulp magazine writer, wrote over 100 novels and numerous short stories before his death in 1949. John Barry was Bedford-Jones\u2019s last novel, and his talent for careful historical research earned what little critical acclaim the novel drew from reviewers, who credited the authors of John Barry with \u201cundefatigable research.\u201d Typical of Fearing\u2019s narrative techniques were the 70 points of view depicted in this novel about the development of San Francisco from 1846 to 1850. The title character, John Barry, is a young man from Maine who in 1847 helps rescue the Donner party when it is trapped in deep snow and some of its members are surviving by eating the flesh of those who have died; he also mines for gold and plays a part in the settling of San Francisco. However, as with Clark Gifford\u2019s Body, the novel has no sense of immediacy, and only John Barry\u2019s presence in most episodes gives the novel a slight continuity.\nIn Loneliest Girl in the World (1951), Fearing recaptured some of the success of The Big Clock. Although again using multiple narrators, Fearing concentrates on the title character, Ellen Vaughn, the daughter of the late Adrian Vaughn, who invented Mikki, a sound recorder and library system. Ellen becomes an investigator of the past when she discovers that within Mikki\u2019s 463,635 hours of recorded speeches, music, and business transactions is the key to her father\u2019s death. She also realizes how naive and sheltered she has been when by accident she hears a recording of her lover Tom Crandell\u2019s plan to use her to gain control of Mikki and her father\u2019s business. In taking control of her life, Ellen comments, \u201cA woman\u2019s identity is a simple equation; it is the sum of the men she has loved, minus the ones she has hated. Multiplied by, apparently, a great, great many enemies. Divided by the very few people who emerge from a cloudy chaos to form the illusion of a stable and trustworthy world.\u201d Fearing\u2019s style is humorous, and his full characterization of Ellen encourages the reader to care about her fate. Ellen uses her skill as an audio engineer to find the tape that contains the last argument between her father and her brother Oliver, during which the two fought over how to exploit Mikki and fell to their deaths from the balcony of the Vaughn penthouse. When Ellen exposes the stock scandal her father created, the Vaughn fortune is lost, and to free herself finally of the past, Ellen \u201criddles\u201d Mikki with an automatic. Since Ellen\u2019s investigation, however, depends more on information retrieval than on real detection, ultimately the novel suffers in comparison with The Big Clock. Again the final solution comes too easily to merit the long \u201cchase,\u201d and reviewers objected to Fearing\u2019s dated message that machines were a threat to human relations. The novel, however, is really, as one character says, about \u201cthe children of the strong. Simply gone to seed. ... Not a foot of solid earth to stand on.\u201d Ellen\u2019s final liaison with James Kell, a cartoonist who never knew his parents and has made and lost a fortune, shows her desire to find her own solid, if common, ground free of all links to the past. The story of how Ellen overcomes the \u201cadvantages\u201d of her past is more absorbing than her search for the truth.\nFearing\u2019s last two novels failed to interest either reviewers or readers. In both The Generous Heart (1954) and The Crozart Story (1960) Fearing continues to tell a suspenseful story from various points of view, but he exchanges the crisp and witty style of The Big Clock and Loneliest Girl in the World for a more complicated one. One reviewer commented that in The Generous Heart, the \u201ctalk\u201d was complex enough \u201cto require the services of a dozen Philadelphia lawyers.\u201d The novel concerns two charity fund-raising organizations, one honest and one crooked. The members of the crooked Generous Heart organization stage a hit-and-run accident to force the honest organization to join forces with them. Fearing includes more violence in this novel, and while his urban setting is again realistic, the novel also lacks a unique \u201cchase.\u201d\nThe Crozart Story opens with a long, complex introduction to the public relations world. Fearing mocked overblown vocabulary in The Big Clock with George Stroud\u2019s explaining to Georgette that when Earl Janoth uses the obscure word geomancer, \u201cEarl got it out of the fattest dictionary ever printed, wrote it on his cuff, and now the rest of us know why he\u2019s the boss.\u201d While each sentence of Lee Hoyt\u2019s introduction in The Crozart Story is intricate and meaningful, more than 40 pages of this complexity along with the difficult style throughout the rest of the novel detract from the plot. For example, Hoyt explains how public relations influences public opinion: \u201cThe fantasies we were adroitly joining and fashioning into loaded rumors, those gossamer rumors we were transmuting into triggered press releases, those childlike releases we were everywhere implementing with public degradation, internal exile, imprisonment, those incandescent anxieties we were molding and hardening into death\u2019s-head taboos\u2014all these components of the commando raids we were mounting for the world\u2019s richest haul consisted of words, basically, only words.\u201d The reader feels that Fearing is committing as well as condemning an abuse of communication rather than telling a story. The title character, Steve Crozart, believes that each successful public relations stunt must have a victim. In an extreme maneuver, Crozart stages his own supposed death to provoke a merger between two public relations firms, and Lee Hoyt uses this event to attempt his own coup, but Crozart returns to a world in which he is expendable, and Hoyt almost loses control of his empire. As in Clark Gifford\u2019s Body, Fearing uses newspaper clippings, this time to help his narrators present the intricacies of business and the public mind, but in both of Fearing\u2019s last novels, the plots seem excuses for exposes of big business. Fearing died of cancer in 1961, a year after The Crozart Story appeared.\nFearing\u2019s The Big Clock has been placed on the list of American suspense classics. His use of multiple narrators allowed him to create unique chase scenes in which readers knew both the pursuers and the pursued. However, most detective novels are puzzles in which the identity of the criminal is revealed in the end. Fearing\u2019s narrative technique lent itself well to building suspense, but he often ended his thrillers too abruptly or chose an easy solution to the mystery. At times he portrayed the city and its inhuman organizations better than he did his main characters. Fearing\u2019s brittle style at its best matched that of Hammett and Chandler. While scholars continue to study Fearing\u2019s poetry, readers of popular fiction have rediscovered The Big Clock because Fearing is a master at psychological suspense.\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["Modern"]}}
