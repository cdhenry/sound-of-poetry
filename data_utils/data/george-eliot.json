Like so many of her contemporaries, Eliot tried to make significant literary contributions in more than one genre; her poems\u2014both narrative and lyric\u2014deal, however, with some of the same themes which inform her novels and short stories. Her poems are less accomplished than her prose fiction\u2014only one poem, \u201cO May I Join the Choir Invisible,\u201d has achieved any lasting fame\u2014but they do stand as an informative window on to her life as a writer.\n\r\nGeorge Eliot was born Mary Ann Evans in rural Warwickshire and was unusually well educated for a woman of her time. Her first publication, a poem published in the Christian Observer in January 1840, \u201c'Knowing That Shortly I Must Put Off This Tabernacle,'\u201c displays the influence of Eliot\u2019s Evangelical teachers.\u00a0 In 1841, Eliot came in contact with a group of philosophical thinkers, and her passionate commitment to Christianity began to find new directions. By early 1842 Eliot questioned the historical foundations of Christianity so much that she both abandoned her faith and stopped attending church services, a move that led to strenuous conflict with her father. Eliot eventually resumed church attendance but did not return to active faith. In forty-three lines of blank verse, Eliot claims in \u201cO May I Join the Choir Invisible\u201d that the only afterlife one can have comes from participation in the growing group of men and women who make the world a better place to live\u2014better in human terms, individually and collectively. The piece demonstrates Eliot\u2019s unconventional thinking in a highly orthodox Christian society.\n\r\nAt the encouragement of London publisher John Chapman, Eliot published a review for the Westminster Review and, excited by her entr\u00e9e to the London literary world, decided to try to earn her living by writing. In 1851, Eliot became assistant editor of the Westminster Review. During her time with the journal, she met many English and American literary figures\u2014most significantly, Herbert Spencer, the author of Social Statics (1851), and George Henry Lewes, the drama critic and founder of the Leader. The subsequent union of Lewes and Eliot was complicated by Lewes\u2019 thirteen-year marriage to Agnes Jervis, who, over time, bore four children by a married friend.\n\r\nA controversial figure during her time, Eliot published translations as well as prose and poetry, all but one under her adopted pseudonym. Among her themes are music; art as an activity of unfathomable human worth; the notion that the past shapes the present; and the conflict in a woman's life between great duty and the prospect of a happy marriage. Her prose masterpiece was the psychologically insightful Middlemarch: A Study of Provincial Life (1871).\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Victorian"]}}
