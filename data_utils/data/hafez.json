Very little is known about his life, but it is thought that he may have memorized the Qur\u2019an after hearing his father recite passages. When his father died, he left school to work at a bakery and as a copyist. Hafiz became a poet at the court of Abu Ishak and also taught at a religious college. He is one of the most celebrated of the Persian poets, and his influence can be felt to this day. As the author of numerous ghazals expressing love, spirituality, and protest, he and his work continue to be important to Iranians, and many of his poems are used as proverbs or sayings.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHafiz\u2019s tomb is in Musalla Gardens in Shiraz.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Asia, South", "Middle East"]}}
