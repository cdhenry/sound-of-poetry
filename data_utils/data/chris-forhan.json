Lawrence Raab commented that the poems in Black Leapt In \u201chave in them something of Theodore Roethke\u2019s excitement at being alive in the physical world\u2014how much there is to see!\u2014as well as Roethke\u2019s certainty of the darkness threaded all through that world.\u201d\nForhan\u2019s poems have appeared in The Best American Poetry 2008, AGNI online, and the Paris Review. He has received a fellowship from the National Endowment of the Arts and two Pushcart Prizes. He teaches in the MFA program at Butler University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
