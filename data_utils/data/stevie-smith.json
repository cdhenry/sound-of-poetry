She graduated from the North London Collegiate School and went on to work as a secretary. She published several collections of short prose and letters as well as nearly a dozen volumes of verse. Although the nursery-rhyme-like cadences of her poems and the whimsical drawings with which she illustrated them suggest a child\u2019s innocence, Stevie Smith was a sophisticated poet, whose work was much concerned with suffering and mortality. Her macabre sense of humor can shock, as in her most famous poem, \u201cNot Waving But Drowning.\u201d\nCalling Smith\u2019s Not Waving but Drowning \u201cthe best collection of new poems to appear in 1957,\u201d Poetry contributor David Wright observed that \u201cas one of the most original women poets now writing. [Stevie Smith] seems to have missed most of the public accolades bestowed by critics and anthologists. One reason may be that not only does she belong to no \u2018school\u2019\u2014whether real or invented as they usually are\u2014but her work is so completely different from anyone else\u2019s that it is all but impossible to discuss her poems in relation to those of her contemporaries.\u201d Smith\u2019s \u201cseemingly light verse,\u201d wrote Linda Rahm Hallett in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, contains a \u201csometimes disconcerting mixture of wit and seriousness \u2026, making her at once one of the most consistent and most elusive of poets.\u201d\u00a0Smith\u2019s writings frequently demonstrated a fascination with death and also explored \u201cthe mysterious, rather sinister reality which lurks behind appealing or innocent appearances,\u201d wrote Hallett. As a result, Wright said, \u201cthe apparent geniality of many of her poems is in fact more frightening than the solemn keening and sentimental despair of other poets, for it is based on a clear-sighted acceptance, by a mind neither obtuse nor unimaginative, but sharp and serious, innocent but far from naive.\u201d \u201cWithout identifying itself with any particular school of modern poetics,\u201d Hallett wrote, \u201c[Smith\u2019s] voice is nevertheless very much that of what she once called the \u2018age of unrest\u2019 through which she lived.\u201d Her first book, Novel on Yellow Paper (1936) examines religion and politics in the lead-up to the Second World War.\nContributing to the deceptive quality of the poet\u2019s work was her language, which a Times Literary Supplement reviewer described as \u201cSmith\u2019s most distinctive achievement.\u201d The critic elaborated: \u201cThe cliches, the excesses, the crabbed formalities of this speech are given weight by the chillingly amusing or disquieting elements; by the sense of a refined, ironic unhappiness underlying the poems; and by the variety of topics embraced by the poet\u2019s three or four basic and serious themes.\u201d Although the writer found some of Smith\u2019s work \u201cindulgent, even trivial \u00a0\u2026 it ought at last to be recognized that Miss Smith\u2019s is a purposeful and substantial talent. From below the surface oddness, her personal voice comes out to us as something questing, discomfiting, compassionate.\u201d Smith\u2019s \u201chighly individualistic poetic style [was] vulnerable to shifts in critical taste and to the charges of eccentricity, a charge which Smith risked, and in a sense even flirted with, throughout her career,\u201d Hallett concluded. \u201cHowever, the integrity with which she adhered to her own style earned Stevie Smith a considerable amount of respect, and, more than ten years after her death, her reputation with both readers and fellow poets is deservedly high.\u201d\nSmith was awarded the Cholmondeley Award for Poets in 1966 and the Queen\u2019s Gold Medal for Poetry in 1969. She died of a brain tumor in 1971. \n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
