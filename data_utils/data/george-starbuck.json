He grew up in Illinois and California. He attended the University of California at Berkeley for two years, and the University of Chicago for three. He then studied with Archibald MacLeish and Robert Lowell, alongside peers Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath, at Harvard University. Starbuck won the Yale Younger Poets Prize for his collection\u00a0Bone Thoughts (1960). He is the author of several other books, including The Argot Merchant Disaster: New and Selected Poems (1982), Elegy in a Country Church Yard (1974), and White Paper (1966). He taught at the State University College at Buffalo, the University of Iowa, and Boston University.\nStarbuck\u2019s witty songs of protest are usually concerned with love, war, and the spiritual temper of the times. John Holmes believed that \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been as much word excitement ... for years,\u201d as one finds in Bone Thoughts. Harvey Shapiro pointed out that Starbuck\u2019s work is attractive because of its \u201cwitty, improvisational surface, slangy and familiar address, brilliant aural quality\u201d and added that Starbuck may become a \u201cspokesman for the bright, unhappy young men.\u201d Louise Bogan asserted that his daring satire \u201csets him off from the poets of generalized rebellion.\u201d\nAfter reading Bone Thoughts, Holmes hoped for other books in the same vein; R.F. Clayton found that, in White Paper (1966), the verse again stings with parody. Although Robert D. Spector wasn\u2019t sure of Starbuck\u2019s sincerity in Bone Thoughts, he rated the poems in White Paper, which range \u201cfrom parody to elegy to sonnets, and even acrostic exercises,\u201d as \u201cgenerally superior examples of their kind.\u201d In particular, Spector wrote, when Starbuck juxtaposes McNamara\u2019s political language and a Quaker\u2019s self-immolation by burning, or wryly offers an academician\u2019s praise for this nation\u2019s demonstration of humanity by halting its bombing for \u201cfive whole days,\u201d we sense this poet\u2019s genuine commitment.\nStarbuck died in Tuscaloosa, Alabama on August 1, 1996.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
