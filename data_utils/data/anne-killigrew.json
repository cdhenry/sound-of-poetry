She was celebrated by\u00a0John Dryden\u00a0in the ode \u201cTo the Pious Memory Of the Accomplished Young Lady, Mrs Anne Killigrew, Excellent in the two Sister-Arts of Po\u00ebsie, and Painting,\u201d which introduced the volume of her poems.\n\r\nKilligrew\u2019s fame rests on this single volume of poetry, a collection of verse probably composed over relatively few years, as she died young, at the age of 24 or 25. Her volume of poems offers an engaging instance of a lively mind commenting on court settings and the conventions, both social and literary, that a young member of the court, male or female, might have encountered in the early years of the Restoration. Killigrew tries her hand at a variety of poetic genres\u2014heroic, pastoral, epigrammatic, occasional, panegyrical\u2014from a variety of stances, old and young, male and female, engaged by or disenchanted with the court. While occasional passages from the poems praise \u201cReason\u201d or warn court \u201cnymphs\u201d of the dangers of Love, the overall effect of Killigrew\u2019s poetry is less \u201cPious\u201d than Dryden\u2019s ode implies. Instead, an examination of the poetry suggests a young poet\u2019s striking out on her own, essaying and frequently mastering the intricacies of her chosen craft.\n\r\nThe daughter of Dr. Henry Killigrew, master of the Savoy and one of the prebendaries of Westminster, Killigrew was born in 1660 shortly before the Restoration, at Saint Martin\u2019s Lane, London. She was christened in a private chamber because the offices in the common prayer were not yet being publicly allowed. Her education, in keeping with her social level, stressed poetry and painting, and her contemporaries praised her for excelling in these two sister arts. In 1685, after her death, her family permitted the publication of a thin quarto of poems (of about one hundred pages) titled\u00a0Poems By Mrs Anne Killigrew. They are prefaced by an epitaph by one \u201cE. E.\u201d titled \u201cOn the Death of the Truly Virtuous Mrs. Anne Killigrew who was Related to my (Deceased) Wife\u201d and by a conventional \u201cPublisher to the Reader\u201d poem by Samuel Lowndes, which is then followed by Dryden\u2019s ode and the long Latin epitaph from her tomb and its translation, both by her father; the collection concludes with some fragments from her own poetry and that of others.\nAmong the early reactions to her poetry is Horace Walpole\u2019s, who comments in\u00a0Anecdotes of Painting in England\u00a0(1726-1780) that her verses show a \u201cversatility of subject,\u201d adding, by way of example, that they include \u201cPastoral Dialogues, Four Epigrams, and the Complaint of a Lover, and lastly, \u2018upon the saying that my verses were made by another.\u2019\u201d Dryden\u2019s ode, of course, praises them fulsomely:\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Her\u00a0Arethusian\u00a0Stream remains unsoil\u2019d,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Unmix\u2019t with Forreign Filth, and undefil\u2019d,\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Her Wit was more than Man, her Innocence a Child!\n\r\nOthers responded more to Dryden\u2019s prefatory ode than to the poems themselves, most notably\u00a0Samuel Johnson, who considered that ode to be the \u201cnoblest in our language.\u201d Theophilus Cibber, in his\u00a0Lives of the Poets\u00a0(1753), summarizes Killigrew\u2019s initial reputation when he observes that \u201cMr. Dryden is quite lavish in her praise; and we are assured by other contemporary writers of good probity, that he has done no violence to truth in the most heightened strains of his panegyric.\u201d Although Killigrew\u2019s own poems also include some lines addressed to\u00a0Katherine Philips, nothing similar has been discovered to record a more extended reaction of her contemporaries to her own verse.\n\r\nThe first two poems, evidently the earliest composed of those Killigrew chose to save or her family elected to publish, are intriguing both for their choice of subject and for the deft way in which the failure of the first is appropriated for the success of the second. The first, \u201cAlexandreis,\u201d although unfinished (\u201cfirst Essay of this young Lady in Poetry,\u201d her editor\u2014probably a Killigrew\u2014remarks, laid \u201cby till Practice and more time should make her equal to so great a Work\u201d), has a confident, exuberant tone, not particularly tempered by Killigrew\u2019s acknowledgment that by age, experience, and sex she is perhaps not ready for such an effort. It begins in true epic fashion\u2014\u201cI sing the Man that never Equal knew, / Whose Mighty Arms all Asia did subdue\u201d\u2014and conventionally requests divine inspiration\u2014\u201dAh that some pitying\u00a0Muse\u00a0would now inspire / My frozen style with a Poetic fire.\u201d Yet, although the poet admits that her sex may be an impediment to celebrating a male conqueror\u2014\u201cGreat my presumption is, I must confess, / But if I thrive, my Glory\u2019s ne\u2019re the less; / Nor will it from his Conquests derogate / A Female Pen his Acts did celebrate\u201d\u2014she rather neatly answers her own objection in the second part of the poem when the troops described there, with \u201cScarlet Plumes\u201d and \u201chaughty Crests,\u201d turn out to be Amazons, not Alexander\u2019s, and are clearly identified as his rivals in both splendor and reputation. Thus the Amazons by their very presence qualify the opening line of the poem, shifting its stress from Alexander, \u201cthe Man that never Equal knew,\u201d to an implied \u201camong\u00a0men,\u201d but Killigrew may not have intended that small irony as the poem does not in any way call attention to it.\nIn contrast the second poem in the collection, \u201cTo the Queen,\u201d refers overtly and with some amusement to the failure of the first poem and then converts that amusement to a serious point about the limitations of heroic poetry for the present age. \u201cSo thought my\u00a0Muse\u00a0at her first flight,\u201d the poet announces with reference to the earlier poem, that \u201cshe had chose the greatest height\u201d; but when the queen\u2019s \u201cEye wholly divine / Vouchsaf\u2019d upon my Verse to Shine,\u201d then the poet found herself moved to \u201cPitty\u201d for \u201chim the World called\u00a0Great\u201d and instead smiled at his \u201cUnequal (though Gigantick) State.\u201d In this poem Alexander becomes not a hero but a clumsy giant, flailing with \u201cFrantick Might\u201d against \u201cWind-Mills,\u201d an absurd Don Quixote when contrasted with the queen\u2019s quiet \u201cGrace\u201d and \u201cCharms.\u201d The poem then proceeds to work skillfully through a series of oppositions between hyperactive, absurdly dimensioned brutal and often ludicrous force and nondimensioned \u201cGoodnesse,\u201d which, itself inactive, activates others by ruling \u201cmens Wills, but with their Hearts.\u201d At the same time, the tone shifts from the banter of the opening lines to a serious indictment of a second \u201cGiant,\u201d \u201cbold Vice unmasked,\u201d who blatantly shows his \u201cUlcerous Face,\u201d lacking even the hypocrisy to hide the effects of the moral equivalent of venereal disease. Against such corruption, the poem points out, an Alexander\u2019s force has no relevance, and even a queen\u2019s virtue can offer no more than a \u201cShelter,\u201d not full conquest. The poem concludes that in such an age the heroic has no operative force, and a poet can only \u201cMourn,\u201d not \u201csing.\u201d\nThe poem does not make clear which queen is being addressed. Most probably the editor, responsible for the title, assumed the \u201cqueen\u201d to be Mary of Modena, who had assumed the throne with James II shortly before Killigrew\u2019s death and would thus have been queen as the volume went to press. The less-experienced handling of verse form and meter, however, coupled with the direct reference to the earlier poem implies composition before the reign of James II. As Killigrew was later to address \u201cQueen Katherine\u201d on the occasion of her birthday, it is possible that she is the queen of the title for this poem as well.\nThe poem which follows these first two, \u201cA Pastoral Dialogue,\u201d completes the introduction to Killigrew\u2019s world by implying the same rather pessimistic conclusion about the nonheroic nature of the times, although in a different context, love. Dorinda, the female speaker, offers Alexis, the traditional pastoral shepherd-lover, her gifts of song if he will accept her love. Already plighted to Lycoris (Lust), however, he gently refuses Dorinda and refutes her reference to Lycoris\u2019s less-than-virginal past by arguing that what occurred between Lycoris and an earlier lover, because it took place before he knew her, was \u201cnot to be my Care.\u201d To Dorinda\u2019s reiterated offer of a purer \u201cVirgin love ... that\u2019s newly blown / ... / not once mis-plac\u2019t,\u201d he acknowledges the greater purity but refutes its possibility, or even its desirability, for mortals like himself: \u201cThus do our Priests of Heavenly Pastures tell, / Eternal Groves, all Earthly, that excell: / And think to wean us from our Love below, / By dazzling Objects which we cannot know.\u201d\nThe three opening poems can thus be seen as introducing the variety that follows, for while different groupings are clearly distinguished from each other, there is constantly the implication that the world in which Killigrew lives is no longer heroic. Her epigrams, for example, while skillfully delivering a typically witty turn at their respective closings, often do so with a cynicism that sounds more local than conventional. The fourth epigram, \u201cOn Galla,\u201d for instance, opens with an indictment of a winter cold spell so severe that even \u201cCorinna\u2019s youthful cheeks ... / Look pale and bleak, and shew a purple hew, / And Violets stain, where Roses lately grew.\u201d The poem concludes, however, with a bitter tribute to \u201cGalla\u00a0alone,\u201d who \u201cwith wonder we behold, / Maintain her Spring, and still out-braves the Cold.\u201d \u201cSure Divine beauty in this Dame does shine?\u201d the naive voice admiringly questions. \u201cNot Humane\u201d comes the response, \u201cyet not Divine.\u201d As cosmetic art is given its dubious due, the imagery of the natural world in the earlier lines is called into question, converted to, and indicted as the artifice of the world of the court. Corinna, it is implied, in this world is always Galla, her virtue, like her violets, more stained than pure.\nThe Restoration world that Anne Killigrew inhabited admittedly supplied an abundance of material for indictment, of a magnitude on a significantly greater scale than that of the use of cosmetics. Nonetheless, Mary of Modena\u2019s immediate household, both before she became queen and after, seems to have endeavored to remain self-consciously exempt from the more general corruption. The duchess of York and her ladies lived in an atmosphere where the liberal arts were honored and practiced and where the discussion of serious topics was encouraged. A list of the maids of honor, drawn up in 1683 by Gregario Leti, historiographer to Charles II, includes Anne Kingsmill, later to become\u00a0Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea, another poet; Penelope O\u2019Brien, Countess of Petersborough, accomplished in French, who had been with the duchess since her marriage; Susanna Armine, Lady Belasyse, who as a young widow in 1670 had so attracted James with her remarkable powers of mind that he had once \u201cwooed her for his wife\u201d; and Catherine Sedley, who drew the highest salary, a brilliant woman and celebrated wit.\n\r\nKilligrew\u2019s pastoral poems, traditionally opening the way to commentary on court matters, would certainly bear investigation in this light. The first pastoral dialogue, already mentioned, in its concluding lines invites contemporary reference, and some scholars have suggested that the \u201cDorinda\u201d of this poem might be equated with either Katherine Philips or Catherine Sedley. More generally, the second \u201cPastoral Dialogue\u201d\u00a0strikes a note consistent with the moral ambitions of the duchess of York\u2019s court, as a tough-minded and witty Alinda rejects the shepherd-suitor Amintor\u2019s complaint that her avoidance of him should be curtailed by this strenuous effort of pursuit. Turning his own argument back on him, Alinda replies:\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What wonder, Swain, if the Pursu\u2019d by Flight,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Seeks to avoid the close Pursuers Sight?\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And if no Cause I have to fly from thee,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then thou hast none, why dost thou follow me.\n\r\nPrompted to woo by less insulting means than sophistry, Amintor then succeeds in shifting from conventional flattery to sincere admiration. Rightly praising Alinda\u2019s virtue over beauty, he remarks, in lines that seem strikingly suitable to Killigrew herself, that he loves her because\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thou still Earliest at the Temple art,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And still the last that does from thence depart;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pans\u00a0Altar is by thee the oftnest prest,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thine\u2019s still the fairest Offering and the Best;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ......................................\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strict in thy self, to others Just and Mild;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Careful, nor to Deceive, nor be Beguil\u2019d;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...................................\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even on thy Beauty thou dost Fetters lay,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Least, unawares, it any should betray.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ................................\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Beholding with a Gen\u2019rous Disdain,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The lighter Courtships of each amorous Swain;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Knowing, true Fame, Vertue alone can give:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nor dost thou greedily even that receive.\n\r\nAlthough Alinda remains cautious, she nonetheless concedes that if she ever surrenders to any it will be to one who \u201cdoes, like to\u00a0Amintor\u00a0love,\u201d and the poem becomes less seductive than instructive in the proper ways of wooing the serious court lady. In this context the poem might even be read as a tribute, for it is tempting to see it as occasioned by the exemplary courtship and marriage in 1684 of Killigrew\u2019s friend Anne Kingsmill to Heneage Finch, captain of the halberdiers of the duke of York and the future Lord Winchilsea.\n\r\nThe longest and most ambitious of Killigrew\u2019s pastorals, \u201cA Pastoral Dialogue: Melib\u00e6us, Alcippe, Asteria, Licida, Alcimedon, and Amira,\u201d invites a similar reading out of the context of Mary of Modena\u2019s court, and, although generalized in its images and morality, might also reward the effort to align its speakers with specific historical figures from Killigrew\u2019s circle.\n\r\nThe three poems dealing with her own paintings, however, strike an individual note that separates Killigrew\u2019s collection of verse from similar efforts by her contemporaries. The poems are brief\u2014two on biblical subjects, one on a scene drawn from mythology. Interestingly, they do not directly address the topic one might have expected from a poet/painter, the relative merits of word and image, nor do they explicitly acknowledge the sister arts tradition to which the title of Dryden\u2019s ode refers. Nevertheless, Killigrew\u2019s handling of her material, if not direct in acknowledging the sibling rivalry between the arts, nonetheless implies a decided bias in favor of poetry. Each poem, for example, is spoken by a subject from its respective painting, certainly implying Killigrew\u2019s assent to the traditional Renaissance view of painting as \u201cmute\u201d poetry in need of a viewer to give it voice. That the viewer here is also the artist, and thus the \u201cvoice\u201d an act of ventriloquism, is something that Killigrew regrettably does not make much of, although that point is underscored by each title (most likely not of Killigrew\u2019s choosing): \u201cSt. John Baptist Painted by her self,\u201d \u201cHerodias Daughter ... also Painted by her self,\u201d and \u201cOn a Picture Painted by her self.\u201d The concluding lines of the third poem\u2014\u201cIf you ask where such Wights do dwell, / In what Bless\u2019t Clime, that so excel? / The Poets onely that can tell\u201d\u2014indeed claim special knowledge for the poet without whom the painter\u2019s art is, from this stance at least, tellingly incomplete and thus morally inefficacious.\n\r\nThe effort to derive Killigrew\u2019s biography from her poetry is probably best served by a final grouping of her poems, the occasional pieces. Their topics range from the conventional, in poems addressed to royalty or \u201cOn a Young Lady Whose Lord was Travelling,\u201d to the curious lines on the death of her aunt by drowning. Some of the most interesting include specific reference to Killigrew\u2019s own poetry.\n\r\nThe two poems in which Killigrew refers directly to her own verse are placed closely together in the collection. The first, \u201cUpon the saying that my Verses were made by another,\u201d though its topic is commonplace among women\u2019s poetry of the time, does seem to have been occasioned by a specific incident. In response to her accuser, Killigrew recounts her initial commitment to poetry in terms that invoke the purity and idealism of her first enthusiasm for her craft\u2014\u201cNext heaven my Vows to thee (O Sacred\u00a0Muse!) / I offer\u2019d up\u201d\u2014and makes it clear that neither money nor reputation motivated her original devotion:\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 O Queen of Verse, said I, if thou\u2019lt inspire,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And warm my Soul with thy Poetic Fire,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No Love of Gold shall share with thee my Heart,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Or yet Ambition in my Brest have Part[.]\n\r\nHer sincerity is rewarded: her verse flows easily and is praised by her peers, most probably the circle surrounding Mary of Modena and her ladies. Killigrew\u2019s indignation, when her lines, though praised, are attributed to another, makes an interesting departure from convention, however. Rather than defending her own integrity, she turns self-accuser and chastises herself, not without some amused self-deprecation, for having violated what she knew to be a sacred contract. Seduced by \u201cFalse Hope\u201d for her dedication to earthly, not heavenly, \u201cFame,\u201d she is punished less by \u201cshame\u201d than by loss of that balanced insight with which she was graced before. To \u201cFalse Hope\u201d she says, rather ruefully, \u201cBy thee deceiv\u2019d, methought each Verdant Tree, /\u00a0Apollos\u00a0transform\u2019d\u00a0Daphne\u00a0seem\u2019d to be,\u201d and wittily recounts how every leaf of her own poetry became for her a \u201cgarland\u201d; hence her shock when her verse is attributed to another, better-known collector of such \u201cSacred Wreaths.\u201d She concludes that her punishment is deserved and agrees to accept it with good grace should her gifts be restored: \u201cso\u00a0Phebus\u00a0I by thee / Divinity Inspired and possest may be; / I willingly accept\u00a0Cassandras Fate, / To speak the Truth, although believ\u2019d too late.\u201d One slightly digressive passage in the poem deserves further mention because it implies that Killigrew\u2019s effort to correct her own vanity might not have been entirely successful. Katherine Philips, she suggests, escaped the common female fate of being denied the rewards of her own talent, in part because she was not a great beauty. \u201cWhat she did write, not only all allow\u2019d / But ev\u2019ry Laurel, to her Laurel, bow\u2019d!\u201d Her sex did not \u201cobstruct her Fame,\u201d for she \u201cOw\u2019d not her Glory to a Beauteous Face.\u201d Envy, Killigrew seems to be saying, is an inevitable companion of physical beauty, and one she herself cannot escape.\nThe other poem which strikes a personal note is addressed \u201cTo My Lord Colrane, In answer to his Complemental Verses sent me under the Name of Cleanor.\u201d The poem is intriguing, not only because it offers a clue to the circulation of verse within a system of fanciful names and courtly compliment, but also for its delicate adjustment of status, which implies Killigrew\u2019s sophisticated awareness of the dangers of condescension and triviality that a female poet might risk in appealing to an older, male, mentor. Henry Hales, second Baron Coleraine (1636-1708), was an antiquary of Tottenham, Middlesex. (A copy of Killigrew\u2019s\u00a0Poems\u00a0bearing his bookplate, dated 1702, is in the University of Michigan Library.) Killigrew\u2019s poem to him opens with a narrative account of the verse, evidently highly complimentary, which Coleraine had sent in response to a poem of hers and thus raises the question of a suitable reaction. Should the younger poet be pleased, flattered, reinspired? Before answering, however, she ostensibly digresses to commend Coleraine in respectful lines, which honor him for the fact that among the \u201cGreat,\u201d whose status is usually given to \u201cdang\u2019rous Politicks, and formal Pride,\u201d he should stand out as \u201cOne, who on Ancestors does not rely / For Fame, in Merit, as in Title, high!\u201d The passage, while digressive, in its exchange of compliment for compliment thus serves the more important function of clarifying the relationship between the two poets as one between equals. Hence Killigrew can conclude that the proper use for her of his verse should be that \u201cThis Use of these Applauding Numbers make / Them for Example, not Encomium, take.\u201d\n\r\nTaken together, then, these two poems yield some insight into Killigrew\u2019s reflections on her own verse and into the kind of circulation she sought for it. She seems to have been sensitive to the dangers of excessive praise and aware that the beauty or status of a female poet could impede an accurate assessment of her verse. Yet she also appears willing to permit the circulation of her poems within a select circle, warily testing them by using the good taste of others and her own good sense as guides.\n\r\nBecause the poetry is all one has at present from which to tease out the details of the life and personality of this young poet, it is enticing. As a text reflective of life at court in the first decades of the Restoration, it certainly engages interest. Finally, as a verbal artifact of words, wit, taste, craft, and intelligence, Killigrew\u2019s collection of poems rewards reading. As such it continues to pose an engaging challenge to scholarship and should certainly be of interest in future studies of 17th-century literature and life.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
