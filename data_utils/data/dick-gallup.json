In Tulsa, he befriended poet Ron Padgett and poet and artist Joe Brainard; the three went on to produce The White Dove Review, a magazine that published a number of writers associated with the American midcentury avant-garde, including Allen Ginsberg, LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka), and Robert Creeley. With Ted Berrigan, then a graduate student at the University of Tulsa, the quartet moved to New York City in the early 1960s and formed what is often called the Second Generation New York School, joining writers such as Bernadette Mayer, Alice Notley, Tom Clark, Lewis Warsh, and Clark Coolidge.\r\n\u00a0\r\nGallup collaborated with Brainard on book covers and other projects. He published frequently during the 1960s and 1970s, and his collections from these years include Hinges (1965), The Bingo (1966), Where I Hang My Hat (1970), The Wacking of the Fruit Trees: A Poem in 13 Parts (1975), and Above the Tree Line (1976). Gallup stopped publishing for many years until the release of Shiny Pencils at the Edge of Things: New and Selected Poems (2001). His work appeared in anthologies such as American Poetry Since 1970: Up Late (1987) and Out of This World: An Anthology of the St. Mark\u2019s Poetry Project, 1966\u20131991. He has taught at the Poetry Project, the Boulder Public Library, and the Naropa Institute. He lived in San Francisco until his death in early 2021.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"], "School/Period:": ["New York School (2nd Generation)"]}}
