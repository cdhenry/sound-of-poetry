Her household encouraged her interests in poetry and art, though poor health led her to spend much of her youth in Italy. \u00a0 Often occasional, Fanshawe\u2019s poems explore social and romantic themes. Though she shared some of her work with other writers and friends, she did not publish during her lifetime, save for a few poems in the anthology A Collection of Poems From Living Authors (1823). Her poem \u201cThe Riddle in the Letter H\u201d is often mistakenly attributed to Lord Byron. The bulk of her work was posthumously published in Memorials of Miss C. M. Fanshawe (1865) and Literary Remains of Catherine Maria Fanshawe (1876).  \u00a0 Fanshawe died in Putney Heath in 1834.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Georgian"]}}
