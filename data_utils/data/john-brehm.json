He is the author of\u00a0No Day at the Beach (2020);\u00a0Help Is on the Way (2012), winner of the Four Lakes Prize from the University of Wisconsin Press; and Sea of Faith (2004), which won the Brittingham Prize.\u00a0In the Georgia Review, Judith Kitchen praised Sea of Faith for its \u201cunified consistency of tone and sophistication of approach,\u201d remarking that the \u201cvoice is urbane, humorous, and amused\u2014distanced just enough to poke fun at the world and itself alike, to be able to see the ironies in every predicament.\u201d Kitchen finds that Brehm\u2019s poems give \u201cvoice to the complexities of being, handing us back to ourselves through the surety of his craft.\u201d In awarding Sea of Faith the Brittingham Prize, Carl Dennis described a speaker who is \u201cboth self-mocking and self-accepting, taking his concerns seriously but always distant enough from them to regard them as a small part of a larger human story, a story we recognize at once to be our own.\u201d\u00a0\nBrehm has published a chapbook titled, The Way Water Moves (2002). He was the associate editor of The Oxford Book of American Poetry (2006) and editor of the volume The Poetry of Impermanence, Mindfulness, and Joy (2017). His poems have appeared in Poetry, The Gettysburg Review, The Southern Review, Boulevard, Gulf Coast, The Missouri Review, New Ohio Review, The Sun, The Best American Poetry 1999, The Norton Introduction to Literature, and many other journals and anthologies. He lives in Portland, Oregon, and teaches at Oregon Literary Arts and Mountain Writers Series in Portland, and at Lighthouse Writers Workshop in Denver, Colorado.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
