Her poetry collections include One Morning\u2014 (2015);\u00a0The King (2009); Figment (2004), winner of the Barnard Women Poets Prize; and\u00a0Manderley (2001), selected for the 2001 National Poetry Series. In the Harvard Review, Ellen Davis writes, \u201cWolff\u2019s darkly funny, urbane poems offer observations on gender, work, motherhood, social life, sex, writing, and literature. \u2026 These poems give us memorable, highly original figments.\u201d\nWolff is also the author of the novel The Beginners (2011). She is the founding editor of Fence magazine and Fence Books. She lives in Hudson, New York and\u00a0teaches at the New York State Writers Institute.\n", "attrs": {}}
