His poetry utilizes syntactical and sonic patterns to engage and generate meaning. In a 1968 poetics statement, he noted, \u201cWords have a universe of qualities other than those of descriptive relation: Hardness, Density, Sound-Shape, Vector-Force, & Degrees of Transparency/Opacity.\u201d Reviewing Coolidge\u2019s collection This Time We Are Both (2010), Olga Zilberbourg observed, \u201c[It] is not a work of a cultural tourist, and neither is it a work of an artist whose sole interest is in creating wordscapes. In this long poem, Coolidge is a mature poet who is aware not only of the deep cultural contexts of his words, but also is aware of his poetry being read in political contexts.\u201d\nCoolidge\u2019s numerous collections of poetry include Selected Poems: 1962\u20131985 (2017); 88 Sonnets (2013); Book Beginning What and Ending Away (2013); This Time We Are Both (2010); Sound as Thought (1990), which was chosen for the New American Poetry Series; Own Face (1978); and Flag Flutter & U.S. Electric (1966). His work is included in An Anthology of New York Poets (1970) and The Young American Poets (1968).\nHe is the editor of Philip Guston: Collected Writings, Lectures, and Conversations (2010) and Heart of the Breath: Poems, 1979\u20131992 (1996) by Jim Brody.\nCoolidge lives in Petaluma, California.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"], "School/Period:": ["Language Poetry"]}}
