McGonagall\u2019s first career, as a Shakespearean actor\u2014as Macbeth, he once reputedly refused to die onstage\u2014informed the crowd-pleasing performance that was central to his second career as a poet. He had an epiphany at the age of 52 that prompted him to devote the rest of his life to poetry. His romantic verse\u2014often sparked by recollections of war or natural disaster\u2014is strictly narrative, without lyrical or metaphorical gestures, a style the Guardian\u2019s James Campbell dubs \u201cpoetry of information.\u201d His poems have been criticized for their lack of imagery and lapses in rhythm and meter, and his style has been frequently parodied. His work is immediately recognizable and memorable, however, and emotionally driven.\nMcGonagall published only a single volume of poems in his lifetime, Poetic Gems (1890), but made a living selling broadsides of his work and offering dramatic performances of it. He traveled extensively despite his limited means\u2014including a 50-mile trek on foot to see Queen Victoria (he was refused at the gate)\u2014and late in life claimed to have been given the title \u201cSir William Topaz McGonagall, Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah\u201d by the king of Burma. Though the story is today presumed to be a hoax, McGonagall adopted the name for the rest of his career. He died in Edinburgh in 1902 in poverty and was buried in a pauper\u2019s grave.\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Scotland"], "School/Period:": ["Victorian"]}}
