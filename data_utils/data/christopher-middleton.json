Born in Truro, England, Middleton served in the Royal Air Force before attending Merton College at Oxford University. He taught at the University of Zurich and King\u2019s College in London, and at the University of Texas at Austin from 1966 to 1998. Highly regarded as a translator, Middleton translated the work of major German authors including Robert Walser, Gottfried Benn, Christa Wolf, and Paul Celan. In 1987 he was awarded the prestigious Schlegel-Tieck Translation Prize.\nMiddleton\u2019s own poetry is notable for its erudition, playfulness, and openness to experiment. \u201cAlthough its roots are in surrealism \u2026 and German Expressionism,\u201d Brian Swann commented in Library Journal, \u201cMiddleton\u2019s poetry is unlike any other. He specializes in lively juxtapositions, incongruities of collage, the play of forms \u2026 Vistas recede in a number of poems into the prehistoric so we are aware of mysterious correlations.\u201d\nMiddleton\u2019s first collection of poetry to be widely published was Torse 3 (1962), which shared the Geoffrey Faber Award. Describing the volume as an \u201capprentice book of experiments,\u201d Oliver Dixon in The Wolf noted the range and variety of Middleton\u2019s effects; from blank verse to off-rhymed couplets to sonnets, the book is full of \u201c\u2018developable surfaces\u2019 that lay the foundations for later work,\u201d according to the reviewer. One of Middleton\u2019s continuing concerns has been the shaping of each individual poem to suit its particular subject. \u201cHis concern to produce an individual structure of perception for every place, thought and experience he writes about,\u201d noted Alan Brownjohn in the New Statesman, \u201cresults in a ceaseless and challenging originality.\u201d Such originality has often put Middleton at odds with the British poetry mainstream, though his stubbornly experimental streak is sometimes seen as a corrective to it. In his collection of essays\u00a0The Pursuit of the Kingfisher (1983), Middleton calls for an \u201cexigent poetry, hard-bitten poetry, which goes to the limits of the conceivable and thus relocates the centre,\u201d descrying the \u201csuave poetry\u201d which he sees as dominating the British literary scene. Critic George Steiner has argued that Middleton\u2019s \u201clinguistic range, the severe seriousness of his conception of the role of the poet and of the poet\u2019s reader in these \u2018terrible times\u2019, his unembarrassed celebration of the visionary, \u2018transcendent\u2019 potentialities in art and the imagination, are correctives to the retrenched provincialism of the current English manner.\u201d\nIn books such as\u00a0The Lonely Suppers of W.V. Balloon (1975), 111 Poems (1983), and The Balcony Tree (1992), Middleton continued to explore a startling array of topics, themes, and forms. Denis Donoghue\u00a0called 111 Poems \u201cmetrically inventive and various, these poems are remarkably alive to \u2018the unknown thing beside us\u2019; they listen for \u2018the due sound\u2019, and, as if watching birds, register \u2018the timed flight of words.\u2019\u201d Though not solely concerned with its own status, Middleton\u2019s poems frequently interrogate the limitations of poetry as such. Perhaps as a result, Middleton\u2019s poetry was lauded and queried in almost equal measure. Oliver\u00a0Dixon noted that, like W.H. Auden and Thom Gunn, \u201crelocation to the States seems to have been \u2026 a liberating move\u201d for Middleton. \u201cThe approach towards language is increasingly fluid and Joycean,\u201d Dixon wrote. \u201cThere are no pre-set formal templates within which to fit neat portions of confessional or descriptive subject-matter; each text is an inclusive act of discovering, through animated dialogue with some point of focus (be it human, animal, household object, historical locale), its own organic form.\u201d\nAlthough he lived in Texas for over 30 years, Middleton was a vital part of the contemporary British poetry scene, and his influence as an innovative poet open to the traditions of other languages, cultures, and even genres is increasing. The British literary scene hailed the publication of his\u00a0Collected Poems in 2008\u00a0as a major event.\nIn addition to his collections of essays and expository writing, Middleton published several books of prose, including\u00a0Loose Cannons: Selected Prose (2014), In the Mirror of the Eighth King (1999), Serpentine (1983), and Pataxanadu (1977).\u00a0\nMiddleton died in Texas on November 29, 2015.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
