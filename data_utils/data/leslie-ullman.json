In her poems, she moves through landscapes with precise boldness, open to the surprise and nuance of encounter\u2014with the self, with others, with the landscapes themselves. In a 2013 interview with Melody Nixon for The Common, Ullman stated, \u201cWhen I travel either literally or in my imagination into landscapes of the past, especially into foreign landscapes \u2026 I find myself seeking to project myself into history, to feel myself part of a continuum, and I suspect my experience of being an American raised in a suburb among assimilated people has given me a particular longing for this. \u2026 For me, absence is often linked with, or leads to, reverie, invention, and new forms of presence.\u201d Discussing the poems in Progress on the Subject of Immensity, poet David Wojahn stated, \u201cFor over thirty years now, Leslie Ullman has steadily refined a poetry of the most acute and lyrically precise mindfulness, of what one of her poems calls the \u2018greater alertness.\u2019 This method has been forged in part by her ability to render the harsh beauties of the southwestern landscapes that have been her adopted home. More important still, however, is her almost shamanistic willingness to visit those liminal states between waking and dreaming, conventional reality and phantasm\u2014states that sometimes offer menace, sometimes wonderment.\u201d \u00a0 Ullman\u2019s debut poetry collection, Natural Histories (1979), was chosen by poet Richard Hugo for the Yale Younger Poets prize. Additional collections include Slow Work Through Sand (1998, a co-winner of the Iowa Poetry Prize), Dreams by No One\u2019s Daughter (2008), and Progress on the Subject of Immensity (2013).  \u00a0 Her honors include multiple fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. Ullman is a professor emerita at the University of Texas at El Paso, where she established the bilingual MFA program. She has also taught at the Vermont College of Fine Arts. Ullman lives in southern New Mexico.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
