In an interview with the Age newspaper, Zwicky addressed the political focus of her later poetry: \u201cMy poems are getting a bit engrossed by the political state of things at the moment \u2026 leaning towards a study of despotism, the waste of life and the need for survival.\u201d She is the author of numerous books of poetry, including Picnic (2006), Kaddish and Other Poems (1982), and Isaac Babel\u2019s Fiddle (1975), as well as The Lyre in the Pawnshop: Essays on Literature and Survival 1974\u20131984 (1986) and the short story collection Hostages (1983). \u00a0 Zwicky has won the Western Australia Premier\u2019s Book Award three times, as well as the New South Wales Premier\u2019s Literary Award, the Patrick White Award, and the Christopher Brennan Award.
