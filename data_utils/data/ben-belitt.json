He studied at the University of Virginia, where he earned a BA and an MA. Sometimes described as an overlooked master of 20th century American poetry, Belitt taught and influenced poets such as\u00a0Susan Wheeler,\u00a0Reginald Shepherd, and\u00a0Lynn Emanuel at Bennington College in Vermont. His poetry won numerous awards, including the Russell Loines Award for Poetry from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Shelley Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America, and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts.\nBelitt\u2019s poems are often characterized as ornate and baroque. Some critics suggest that his work privileges\u00a0sound over sense. An early champion of Belitt\u2019s work,\u00a0Howard Nemerov, pointed out that \u201cBelitt receives the world more exclusively by the ear than most; he writes by a kind of radar, and a relevant sound, by the rules of his procedures, is assumed to be a relevant sense \u2026 This reliance on how things sound \u2026 makes possible his characteristic combination of great elaboration with great intensity.\u201d Susan Wheeler has described Belitt\u2019s predilection for \u201ctropes \u2026 iconography: mummies, doppelgangers, quarks. Nature was fierce, fecund, indifferent; coming to terms with this involved a wrestling. His was a gorgeous, guttural English, with both\u00a0Chaucer\u2019s\u00a0choices and court English.\u201d\nLouisiana State University Press published\u00a0This Scribe, My Hand: The Complete Poems of Ben Belitt\u00a0in 1998.\u00a0Richard Eberhart\u00a0wrote in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review, \u201cIn reading the best poems of Ben Belitt one is passed through a screen of artistry into the open air of mature, deep, universal significance \u2026 We do not have to worry about these poems. We do not have to think of the author, the style, the value. The poet\u2019s subtlety makes them a perfect vehicle for the understanding of what we already know. He has pointed his finger to the depths of the heart.\u201d\nBelitt\u2019s other poetry collections include The Double Witness: Poems, 1970-1976, Nowhere But Light\u00a0(1970),\u00a0The Enemy of Joy: New and Selected Poems (1964), Wilderness Stair (1955), and The Five-Fold Mesh (1938). Over the course of eight collections, he reworked, expanded, condensed, and rearranged his poems so that successive volumes examine the same themes from varying perspectives. His poem \u201cBlock Island Crossing,\u201d for instance, originally published in\u00a0Nowhere But Light, was reformulated as \u201cBlock Island: After\u00a0The Tempest\u201d in\u00a0The Double Witness. In\u00a0Salmagundi,\u00a0Lorrie Goldensohn noted that\u00a0\u201ceach successive book cannibalizes a portion of the last; adds titles; drops titles; whitens intervals between sections, or colors them with new material altogether.\u201d Packed with allusions to literature, biology, and autobiography, Belitt\u2019s dense, catholic approach to subject matter and form earned him praise, but he had a limited readership. According to the late poet and critic Reginald Shepherd, \u201cpart of the reason for the neglect of Ben\u2019s work, besides his lack of interest in self-promotion, is the density and obliquity of his work, and what Howard Nemerov calls its \u2018menacing intensity.\u2019\u201d\nBelitt translated many books of poetry by Pablo Neruda\u00a0and\u00a0Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca. Some critics suggested that his translations strayed too far from the original verse. Wheeler defended Belitt, though, arguing that his \u201ctranslations took liberties, much as Lowell\u2019s did, in his deliberate enterprise to re-imagine the poems in English, to create parallel, vital new works.\u201d\nBelitt also published several books of prose, including the essay collections The Forged Feature: Toward a Poetics of Uncertainty: New and Selected Essays (1995) and Adam\u2019s Dream: A Preface to Translation (1978). He died in Bennington, Vermont in 2003.\r\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
