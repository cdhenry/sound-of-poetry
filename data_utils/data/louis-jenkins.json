Born in Oklahoma, Jenkins lived near Duluth, Minnesota, for over 30 years. The author of many books, his late poetry collections included Where Your House Is Now: New and Selected Prose Poems (Nodin Press, 2019), In the Sun Out of the Wind (2017), Before You Know It: Prose Poems 1970-2005 (2009), European Shoes (2008), and North of the Cities (2007). His work was regularly featured on the radio show A Prairie Home Companion. His brief, accessible prose poems use humor, wry observation, and hypothesis to tease out the absurdity of everyday situations. In his poems, Jenkins maintained a tight focus on the mundane particularities of ordinary existence, using deliberately flat language to comic and often heartbreaking effect. He died in late 2019.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
