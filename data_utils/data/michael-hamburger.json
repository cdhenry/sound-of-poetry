His father was a German Jewish professor of pediatrics, and the family fled Nazi Germany for Britain in 1933. Hamburger was educated at Oxford University, where he befriended the poets Dylan Thomas and Philip Larkin. While in college, Hamburger was drafted into the army and served in Austria and Italy during World War II. He returned to Oxford after the war to complete his undergraduate work. \u00a0 In his early work, Hamburger made use of strict forms; later, he embraced free verse. Influenced by T.S. Eliot, Hamburger explored themes of loss, exile, and the natural world. His collections of poetry include Flowering Cactus (1950) and Collected Poems (1984). Hamburger published a memoir, A Mug\u2019s Game (1973), which he later revised into A String of Beginnings (1991). He also wrote a critical work on modern poetry, The Truth of Poetry (1969), and edited the anthology East German Poetry (1973). \u00a0 Hamburger translated numerous poets\u2019 work from German into English and taught himself Italian in order to read Dante. His many translations include Baudelaire\u2019s Twenty Prose Poems (1946), Decline: 12 Poems by Geore Trakl (1952), An Unofficial Rilke: Poems 1912\u20131926 (1981), Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s Poems and Fragments (1967), and Poems of Paul Celan (1980), for which he received the European Translation Prize in 1990. His additional honors include Germany\u2019s Goethe Medal, Austria\u2019s State Prize for Translation, a Bollingen Foundation fellowship, as well as honorary doctorates from the University of East Anglia and Berlin\u2019s Technische Universit\u00e4t. \u00a0 Hamburger served as an advisory editor of Modern Poetry in Translation and taught at the University of Reading, Mount Holyoke College, and UC San Diego. With his wife, poet Anne Beresford (Anne Ellen File), Hamburger spent his later years in Suffolk. He died in 2007 at the age of 83.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Germany"]}}
