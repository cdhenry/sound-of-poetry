She is the author of a children\u2019s novel\u00a0Sarah\u2019s Waterfall: A Healing Story about Sexual Abuse\u00a0(2009).\n\r\nAkers\u2019s plainspoken, unflinching poems investigate grief and joy as they explore the human condition. In her essay \u201cOn Writing: Feeding the Lake,\u201d Akers stated, \u201cI believe the process of poetry is mysterious. Jung once said that poets carry the soul of the culture, and I think good poems do reflect a kind of psychic development that transcends craft or competence.\u201d Her honors include the Poetry International Prize, the John Masefield Award, an Independent Publisher Book Award, the Paumanok Award, and Sierra magazine\u2019s Nature Writing Award; and fellowships and residencies from the MacDowell Colony, Blue Mountain Center, and Headlands Center for the Arts.\n\r\nAkers lives in Marin County, California.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
