Once a student of mathematics, Ramke studied literature as an undergraduate and earned a PhD from Ohio University. The author of many poetry collections, including Missing the Moon (2014), Aerial (2012), and Theory of Mind: New & Selected Poems (2009), Ramke combines these typically disparate interests to inform his poems. Of Ramke\u2019s collection Tendril (2007), John Ashbery wrote, \u201cBin Ramke\u2019s poetry presents itself as the product of curious research on many different topics, most particularly etymology, but with side trips to mathematics, Greek philosophy, the poetry of Rilke and Christopher Smart\u2014 just about anything, in fact.\u201d\nRamke has said of his writing, \u201cThe sort of work I do is concerned with sound, but in a subtle, nuanced way. It\u2019s a combination of personal imagination and experience\u2014experience in an unrecognizable form.\u201d Ramke draws from a broad range of sources for his poetry and is willing to allow the \u201caccidental\u201d to enter the writing process.\nHis first collection of poems, The Difference Between Night and Day (1978), won the Yale Younger Poets Prize. His books The Massacre of the Innocents (1994) and Wake (1998) were both awarded the Iowa Poetry Prize.\nRamke was editor of the University of Georgia Press\u2019s Contemporary Poetry Series from 1984 to 2005. He teaches at the University of Denver, where he edits Denver Quarterly.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
