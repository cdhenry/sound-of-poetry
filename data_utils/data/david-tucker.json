He earned a BA at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where he studied with poet Donald Hall. \u00a0 Booklist critic Donna Seaman has described his poems as \u201cdeceptive in their sturdy plainness \u2026 inlaid with patterns as elegant as the swoop of swallows, and images as startling and right as a cat's bowl of milk shimmering as its \u2018moon god.\u2019\u201d His debut collection, Late for Work (2006), was awarded the Katharine Bakeless Nason Prize by judge Philip Levine. Hall, a former US poet laureate, appointed Tucker a Witter Bynner Foundation Fellow in 2007. His poetry has been published in former U.S. Poet Laureate Ted Kooser's column, \"American Life in Poetry.\" A newspaper editor for more than 25 years, Tucker is an editor for the Metro section of the Newark Star-Ledger newspaper, where he was part of the team that won the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
