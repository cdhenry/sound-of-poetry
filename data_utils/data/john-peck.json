Peck\u2019s allusive, musically nuanced poetry shows clear traces of Pound, though Peck\u2019s syntax is far more rounded and bridgelike than Pound\u2019s cantilevered structure, and Peck\u2019s ideas and metaphors tend to engage rather than insist. Peck writes primarily in free verse, though he does, in his words, \u201cplait phonic elements across both accentual and syllabic grids.\u201d  According to critic Robert Archambeau, \u201cAt a time when poetry seems dominated by the banalities of the backyard epiphany, on the one side, and by faux Gertrude Stein nonsense-verse on the other, learnedness is a welcome poetic virtue. This is especially true when it comes off less as pedantry than as a passion of mind, as in Peck\u2019s case.\u201d Archambeau goes on to call Peck \u201cperhaps the most challenging\u2014and one of the most rewarding\u2014American poets of his generation.\u201d  Peck won the Prix de Rome for his second poetry collection, The Broken Blockhouse Wall (1978), and then moved to Zurich, where he trained as an analyst at the C.G. Jung Institute. After more than a decade of publishing silence, Peck published three volumes of poetry in four years. Speaking to the relationship between his analytical work and his writing, Peck has said that \u201cJung\u2019s psychology has deepened my respect for the gap between framing an intuition in words and actually taking in what the larger personality would have one incorporate.\u201d  His honors include fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the American Academy in Rome, an award from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, AGNI\u2019s Anne Sexton Poetry Award, and the first annual Thomas McGrath Prize in poetry.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
