She\u00a0is the first female poet to receive the prestigious Midang and Kim Su-yong awards, and her collections include I\u2019m OK, I\u2019m Pig! (Bloodaxe Books, 2014), Poor Love Machine (Action Books, 2016), and Autobiography of Death (New Directions, 2018). Her work has been translated into many languages, including Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Spanish, and Swedish. According to her English translator Don Mee Choi, \u201cKim's poetry goes beyond the expectations of established aesthetics and traditional \u2018female poetry\u2019 (y\u014fryusi), which is characterised by its passive, refined language\u2026 Kim's poetics are rooted in her attempt to resist conventional literary forms and language long defined by men in Korea.\u201d\nKim lives in Seoul and teaches creative writing at the Seoul Institute of the Arts.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Asia, East"]}}
