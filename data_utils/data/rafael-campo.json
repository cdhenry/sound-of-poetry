He practices internal medicine at both Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Campo earned a BA and an MA from Amherst College, and an MD from Harvard Medical School. Campo started practicing internal medicine in the early 1990s, at the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US. His writing reflects his commitment to poetry as the fullest expression of self, and his understanding of it as a necessary tool for healing and empathy.\n\r\nCampo is the author of many poetry collections, including Alternative Medicine\u00a0(2013);\u00a0The Enemy (2007), which received the Sheila Motton Book Prize from the New England Poetry Club;\u00a0Landscape with Human Figure\u00a0(2002);\u00a0Diva\u00a0(1999), a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award;\u00a0What the Body Told\u00a0(1996), winner of a Lambda Literary Award;\u00a0and The Other Man was Me\u00a0(1994), winner of the National Poetry Series. In a review of Campo\u2019s Comfort Measures Only: New and Selected Poems, 1994\u20132016 in Booklist, Ray Olson remarked, \u201cIn every poem, as in his and our lives generally, the world goes reeling around him \u2026 [Campo\u2019s] poetic success depends on an unobtrusive mastery of meter\u2014does any other American these days write better iambic pentameters? He also usually writes in forms, as simple as blank verse, as intricate as villanelles and variously rhymed tercets, and as a form demands, rhyme, though using assonance and/or consonance more than full homophony. This doctor-poet is as careful in his avocation as his poems imply he is in his vocation.\u201d\nHis poems often address questions of illness, health, suffering, and identity. He has \u201cprescribed\u201d poetry to his patients and led poetry workshops for them. \u201cWe come to poetry,\u201d he has said, \u201cI think because we are silenced in many ways. In biomedicine, we\u2019re so good at appropriating the narrative\u2014the biopsy report, the CT count, the potassium level. Writing gives patients an opportunity to say, this is\u00a0my\u00a0cancer, this is\u00a0my\u00a0HIV. It\u2019s not a generic, what you see on the mammogram or how many lymph nodes are positive\u2014I\u2019m an individual.\u201d\nCampo\u2019s poetry tends to mix narratives of family, history, and illness with an attention to form, especially received forms. His interest in forms, he has alleged, comes from his own \u201chybrid\u201d experience: \u201cBeing a hybrid myself, I\u2019m very interested in playing with Indonesian forms and Middle Eastern forms, importing some of these things, being in a way almost promiscuous with form.\u201d Critic Frederick Luis Aldama described Campo\u2019s technique in his early work: \u201cHis poems are highly structured \u2026 he uses the security of form as a position from which to delve deep into the heart of his own feelings\u2014feelings for his AIDS and cancer patients and for emergency room arrivals who have suffered from brutal encounters with an overwhelmingly homophobic and racist American society.\u201d\nOther collections of Campo\u2019s poetry also utilize a dramatic range of forms. Diva\u00a0(1999),\u00a0for instance, includes Campo\u2019s translations of poems by\u00a0Federico Garc\u00eda\u00a0Lorca, as well as terza rima, villanelles, pantoums, heroic couplets, and envelope quatrains. In the\u00a0Journal of the American Medical Association,\u00a0Jay A. Liveson called this\u00a0book\u00a0\u201ca virtuoso display\u201d of formal poetic styles.\nBoth of Campo\u2019s collections of prose,\u00a0The Poetry of Healing\u00a0(1997)\u00a0and The Healing Art: A Doctor\u2019s Black Bag of Poetry\u00a0(2003), address the subjects found in his poetry, while describing the difficulties and rewards of being a poet-doctor.\u00a0The Poetry of Healing\u00a0won praise from many different quarters, including reviews in medical journals and a Lambda Literary Award. In\u00a0Christian Century,\u00a0Arthur W. Frank examined the book as a piece of \u201cmedical self-reflection\u201d that challenged the administrative restrictions common to the profession: \u201cCampo\u2019s writing\u2014the transformation of life in narrative and poetry\u2014is the final expression of his fidelity to his patients \u2026 Campo shows the difficulty of cultivating public-spiritedness as an individual virtue within systems of managed care.\u201d\u00a0The Healing Art\u00a0also received praise from literary and medical journals alike. Using poems from poets like\u00a0William Carlos Williams,\u00a0Marilyn Hacker, and\u00a0Lucia Perillo, Campo addresses the necessity of differentiating between \u201chealing\u201d and \u201ccuring.\u201d In the\u00a0New England Journal of Medicine,\u00a0Teresa Schraeder claimed that \u201cRafael Campo uses a palette of poetry to provoke the reader to philosophical, even existential thoughts about the ways in which illness and death define human experience.\u201d\n\r\nCampo\u2019s work has also been selected for inclusion in the\u00a0Best American Poetry\u00a0and\u00a0Pushcart Prize\u00a0anthologies, and has appeared in numerous prominent periodicals including the\u00a0Boston Globe, Commonweal, the Los Angeles Times, The Nation, The New Republic,\u00a0the\u00a0New York Times Magazine, the\u00a0Paris Review, Salon, Slate,\u00a0and the\u00a0Washington Post Book World.\n\r\nCampo is the recipient of numerous honors and awards, including a Guggenheim fellowship, a National Poetry Series award, and two Lambda Literary Awards. He also received an\u00a0honorary Doctor of Literature degree from Amherst College. Campo lectures widely and leads seminars and workshops related to medicine, literary writing, and culture. He is the poetry editor for JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
