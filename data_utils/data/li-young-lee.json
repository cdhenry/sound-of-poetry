Both of Lee\u2019s parents came from powerful Chinese families: Lee\u2019s great grandfather was the first president of the Republic of China, and Lee\u2019s father had been the personal physician to Mao Zedong. In Indonesia, Dr. Lee helped found Gamaliel University. Anti-Chinese sentiment began to foment in Indonesia, however, and Lee\u2019s father was arrested and held as a political prisoner for a year. After his release, the Lee family fled through Hong Kong, Macau, and Japan, arriving in the United States in 1964. Lee and his parents moved from Seattle to Pennsylvania, where Dr. Lee attended seminary and eventually became a Presbyterian minister in the small community of Vandergrift. Though his father read to him frequently as a child, Lee did not begin to seriously write poems until a student at the University of Pittsburgh, where he studied with Gerald Stern.\nInfluenced by the classical Chinese poets Li Bo and Tu Fu, Lee\u2019s poetry is noted for its use of silence and, according to Alex Lemon in the Minneapolis Star Tribune, its \u201cnear mysticism\u201d which is nonetheless \u201cfully engaged in life and memory while building and shaping the self from words.\u201d Though sometimes described as a supremely lyric poet, Lee\u2019s poems often use narrative and personal experience or memories to launch their investigations of the universal. Lee talked about his belief in the oneness of all things in an interview with Tina Chang for the Academy of American Poets: \u201cIf you rigorously dissect it, you realize that everything is a shape of the totality of causes. What\u2019s another name for the totality of causes? The Cosmos. So everything is a shape of Cosmos or God. It feels like something bigger than me\u2014that I can\u2019t possibly fathom but am embedded in.\u201d\nIn his forward to Lee\u2019s debut collection, Rose (1986), Gerald Stern wrote that he \u201cwas amazed by the large vision, the deep seriousness and the almost heroic ideal\u201d of Lee\u2019s poetry, adding that it was \u201creminiscent more of John Keats, Rainer Maria Rilke and perhaps Theodore Roethke than William Carlos Williams on the one hand or T.S. Eliot on the other.\u201d The volume won the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Poetry Award from New York University. Lee\u2019s next collection, The City in Which I Love You (1990), also won high praise, including the Lamont Poetry Selection\u2014now known as the Laughlin Award\u2014which is given in recognition of a poet\u2019s second published book, the only award to do so. Publishers Weekly reviewer Peggy Kaganoff declared that The City in Which I Love You, a remembrance of Lee\u2019s childhood and his father, \u201cweaves a remarkable web of memory from the multifarious fibers of his experience.\u201d Kaganoff added that Lee\u2019s \u201cimages are economical yet fluid, and his language is often startling for its brave honesty.\u201d\n\r\nIn The Winged Seed: A Remembrance (1995) Lee traces his family\u2019s path from Indonesia to Pennsylvania in a memoir that is noted for both its compelling story and lyric language. A reviewer for Library Journal described how \u201cLee interweaves remembrances of incidents from his childhood with dreams, myths, his father\u2019s sermons (dimly remembered), and mundane recollections, such as the seeds in his father\u2019s coat pocket or the coconut oil in his Indonesian nanny\u2019s hair. To the son, the powerful father figure embodied cruelty, Christian kindness, inspiration, deprivation, devotion, and penetrating insight. In this lyrical yet stark rendering of a family of modern China, we see the inner development of the author from his childhood in the 1950s to the present and his adaptation to new world and new perceptions of reality.\u201d Breaking the Alabaster Jar, a collection of interviews with Lee, was published in 2006. The interviews, given throughout the course of Lee\u2019s career, illuminate Lee\u2019s personal aesthetics, personal history, and philosophies.\nLee\u2019s third book, Book of My Nights (2001), deals less explicitly with childhood, family and memory and turns inward \u201cfor a transfiguring kind of introspection\u201d according to M.L. Schuldt in Rain Taxi Review of Books. Schuldt continued: \u201cLee endures sleeplessness to contemplate the self\u2019s urge for total presence. And as with the two volumes that precede it, Lee arrives at his revelations through a pliant, twining syntax and an archetypal diction.\u201d \u00a0The book was awarded the William Carlos Williams award. Lee has said that his next collection, Behind My Eyes (2008), sprang from the \u201cconfusion\u201d that accompanied writing Book of My Nights. In an interview with Poets and Writers magazine, Lee said he hoped Behind My Eyes is \u201cclearer than Book of My Nights. I think I had to go through some real wilderness, tangled vines and trees and being lost in Book of My Nights, confusion about who I am and what\u2019s going on, and what is language, what\u2019s a poem, why am I writing\u2014all that stuff\u2014to get to this book. I hope it\u2019s deeper and simpler.\u201d Alex Lemon found that the poems in Behind My Eyes \u201care always extending the boundaries of what one might feel from a graceful arrangement of words.\u201d Lee\u2019s most recent collection of poems is The Undressing (2018).\nLee has said that he considers every poem to be a \u201cdescendent of God.\u201d When asked about flawed poems by Poets and Writers, Lee explained: \u201cThere are great poems that have flaws. There are failures of perception, failures of understanding, but those flaws become a part of the poem\u2019s integrity, so I still feel that those poems are descendants of God. But if a poem isn\u2019t even good enough to be a poem, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s descended from God: [If] there is no \u201cI\u201d [as in Martin Buber\u2019s I and Thou], there is no God. The \u2018Me\u2019 talking about \u2018Me\u2019\u2014that\u2019s not enough.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
