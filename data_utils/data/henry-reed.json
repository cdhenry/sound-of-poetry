He earned a BA and an MA at the University of Birmingham and wrote his thesis on Thomas Hardy. Reed served in naval intelligence during World War II. He contributed poetry, criticism, plays, and adaptations of older works to British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) radio from 1944 to 1979.  \u00a0 Reed published only one volume of poetry during his lifetime: A Map of Verona (1946), which includes his much-anthologized poem \u201cNaming of Parts.\u201d His Collected Poems (1991), edited by\u00a0Jon Stallworthy, includes a significant selection of previously unpublished work. Reed\u2019s poems are often marked by a sharp wit and occasionally elements of satire or parody. Reviewing Reed\u2019s Collected Poems for the Guardian, Adam Phillips observed, \u201cReed has a plain eloquence for what goes wrong and for what then holds absurdity at bay.\u201d Discussing Reed\u2019s poem \u201cThe Door and the Window,\u201d Phillips noted that \u201cReed wants to show us, without melodrama, how disoriented we are by what language lets us do, what language lets us notice.\u201d \u00a0 Reed\u2019s verse dramas and radio plays are collected in The Streets of Pompeii and Other Plays for Radio (1971) and Hilda Tablet and Others (1971). He is also the author of the critical study The Novel Since 1939 (1946). A selection of his papers and manuscripts is held at the University of Birmingham library.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
