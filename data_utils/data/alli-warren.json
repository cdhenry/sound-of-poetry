Describing Warren\u2019s debut collection Here Come the Warm Jets as \u201cself-reflective, interestingly interrogative, and a lot of fun,\u201d in a 2013 Booklist review, Mark Eleveld noted that the book \u201cplaces the reader at the center of time and presents big questions without ever being declarative. Warren is ever contemporary and wonderfully paradoxical.\u201d In a 2013 interview with Evan Karp for San Francisco Weekly, Warren stated, \u201cI would like to make work that is both engaged with the material facts of the world, with real bodies, and with the fluidity or dynamism of those things, that they have the potential to change. \u2026 I admire writing that is fearless, articulate, and emotional.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nWarren is the author of the poetry collections I Love It Though (Nightboat Books, 2017),\u00a0Don\u2019t Go Home With Your Heart On\u00a0(Faux\u00a0Press, 2014), and\u00a0Here Come the Warm Jets (City Lights Books, 2013), winner of the Poetry Center Book Award; she is also the author of the chapbook Moveable\u00a0C\u00a0(Push Press, 2016). She has edited the literary magazine Dreamboat, co-curated the (New) Reading Series at 21 Grand, coedited the Poetic Labor Project, and contributed to SFMOMA\u2019s Open Space. She lives in the Bay Area.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
