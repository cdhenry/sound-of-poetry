His poems have been included in the anthology Touching the Fire: Fifteen Poets of Today\u2019s Latino Renaissance (1998).\r\n\u00a0\r\nDelgado\u2019s work often portrays the realities of the immigrant experience, with its attendant poverty, hardships, and love. In El Campo, Delgado\u2019s poems about Mexican farmworkers and their families are accompanied by paintings by Simon Silva. Rosa Martha Villarreal, reviewing A Rush of Hands for Tertulia, noted the \u201cmuted images of personal sorrow and terrified wonder,\u201d adding that Delgado \u201ctakes images from the community of shadows, the undocumented immigrants, and gives substance to their being.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nDelgado has been poet-in-residence at the University of Miami. He is a professor of creative writing, Chicano literature, and poetry at the California State University, San Bernardino.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
