She has taught at many universities and served as the president of the Poetry Society of America, where she began the Poetry in Motion program, which places poetry placards on subway cars and buses throughout American cities. She is the author of many books of poetry, including The Analyst (2017), The Second Blush (2008), and\u00a0Cornucopia: New and Selected Poems 1975-2002.\u00a0Her prose works include the story collection\u00a0Alphabetique: 26 Characteristic Fictions (2014), the biography\u00a0Paper Garden: Mrs. Delany Begins Her Life\u2019s Work at 72 (2012), the guide\u00a0How to Read a Poem & Start a Poetry Circle (1999), and the memoir\u00a0Paradise, Piece by Piece (1998).\nPeacock often uses strong rhyme schemes, skillful alliteration, and biting humor to explore such themes as fate, family, sexuality, pain, and the many facets of love. Writing in the Washington Post Book World, David Lehman observed that \u201cPeacock has a luxuriantly sensual imagination\u2014and an equally sensual feel for the language. In mood her poems range from high-spirited whimsy ... to bemused reflection. ... Whatever the subject, rich music follows the tap of her baton.\u201d Annette Allen\u00a0commented on Peacock\u2019s poetic structures, stating that \u201cPeacock\u2019s skillful wielding of form ensures a continual dialectic between the inner world of memory and feeling and the external world. She accomplishes this dynamic, the balance between inner and outer worlds, by employing sound patterns that keep the poem close to unconscious rhythms and by using images or metaphors from the civilized and the natural worlds.\u201d\nPeacock\u2019s first collection, And Live Apart (1980), introduced her artistic preoccupation with the past. Robert Phillips noted in Hudson Review that Peacock\u2019s \u201cconcerns are big ones: the separations we make between one another, the reversals of love, the inescapability of fate, inevitabilities of inheritance, a concern for the language of emotion in conversation.\u201d He went on to say that And Live Apart \u201cis notable for plumbing the past without sentimentality, and for finding new solutions to old dilemmas.\u201d\nIn Take Heart\u00a0(1989), Peacock continues to address inviolable topics, including the horrors and repercussions of physical and mental child abuse. Many of the volume\u2019s opening poems deal with the death of Peacock\u2019s father and her childhood memories of his alcoholism. Several critics praised her ability to illuminate universal concerns through intimate memories. Los Angeles Times Book Review critic Ian Gregson noted, \u201cPeacock is conspicuously courageous in the subjects she is willing to tackle. The [reason] she\u2019s mostly successful in doing so in Take Heart ... is because she\u2019s discovered a technique that meticulously follows the labyrinthine twists and turns of these emotional tangles.\u201d\nPeacock began to move away from more formally structured verse in Original Love (1995). In this work, as Frank Allen stated in Library Journal, she addresses \u201cthe boundaries between men and women, mother and daughter, and one\u2019s mind, body, and senses.\u201d Like her other works, Original Love directly and relentlessly examines such subjects as sexuality, desire, death, and human fallibility. Regarding Peacock\u2019s work as a whole, Allen observed, \u201cThe intelligence and music of her work, the belief in exploring consciousness with honesty, the sheer beauty of the language\u2014all contribute to the \u2018pleasure of the text.\u2019 Because all the pain and joy of living are in [Peacock\u2019s] poetry, people will continue to turn to her poems.\u201d\nPeacock served as president of the Poetry Society of America, where she initiated the Poetry in Motion series on New York City\u2019s subways and buses. After she moved to Canada, she created The Best Canadian Poetry series, and serves as its general editor. Her poetry is the subject of Jason Guriel\u2019s monograph, Molly Peacock: A Critical Introduction (2014). Her papers are held at Binghampton University Library.\nA dual-citizen of Canada and the United States, Peacock lives in Toronto.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
