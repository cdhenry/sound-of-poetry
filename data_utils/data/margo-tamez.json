A teacher and activist, Tamez earned an MFA in creative writing from Arizona State University in 1997. Her collections of poetry include Raven Eye (2007),\u00a0Naked Wanting (2003), and Alleys and Allies (1992).\nTamez\u2019s poetry is informed by an awareness of the culture of indigenous people, social inequities, colonization, sexual violence, women\u2019s labor, and the land; her poems refuse to accept romanticized notions of indigenous life. In a 2007 interview with Lisa Alvarado, she commented that \u201cthe spiritual aspect of \u2018words,\u2019 of \u2018language\u2019 is deeply rooted in memory, in the body\u2019s memory and story, in connection to pain of the heart and pain of the body at convergence.\u201d\nTamez\u2019s Raven Eye was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize by the University of Arizona Press. She received an Environmental Leadership Award, an International Exchange Award from the Tucson Pima Arts Council, and a Poetry Fellowship from the Arizona Commission on the Arts.\nIn 2004 Tamez and Joni Adamson organized the Symposium on Globalism and the Environmental Justice and Toxics Movement in Tucson, Arizona.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
