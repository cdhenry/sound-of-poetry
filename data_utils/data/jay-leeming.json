He earned a BA in music from Bates College and an MFA from the New School.\nLeeming\u2019s work is characterized by what Robert Bly has praised as his \u201csurprising angle of vision,\u201d and is informed as well by his years spent as a singer, songwriter, and guitarist in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His poems are also wide-ranging, able to embrace both darkness and humor and, in the words of Li-Young Lee, to move \u201ceffortlessly between the rational and irrational, the conscious and unconscious, accounting for the multiplicity of human desire and imagination.\u201d\nLeeming has taught poetry workshops throughout the United States and abroad, and has received a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. In 2010 he was Summer Poet in Residence at the University of Mississippi, and from 2010 to 2013 he was editor of the journal Rowboat: Poetry in Translation. He spends his summers working as a ranger-naturalist in Yosemite National Park and otherwise makes his home in Ithaca, New York.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
