In a 2010 interview for the Black Coffee Poet blog, Chrystos stated, \u201cSince my 20\u2019s, when I saw the need to address social justice issues in words, my work just \u2018pops out.\u2019 A newspaper story, an incident from my life, a book, a song, a garden snake, a sad face I see\u2014I have no idea, actually, how these become poems. A line begins in my mind and won\u2019t leave me alone. I\u2019ve learned to sit and write it down and the rest just flows.\u201d\nChrystos\u2019s work has been featured in the anthologies This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color (1981),\u00a0edited by Cherr\u00ede Moraga and Gloria E. Anzald\u00faa,\u00a0and Living the Spirit: A Gay American Indian Anthology (1988), edited by Will Roscoe. With Tristan Taormino, she coedited the anthology Best Lesbian Erotica 1999.\nHer\u00a0honors include the Audre Lorde International Poetry Competition,\u00a0a Barbara Deming Grant, a National Endowment for the Arts grant, and the Sappho Award of Distinction from the Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice.\nSince 1980, Chrystos\u00a0has lived on Bainbridge Island, Washington.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
