Indeed, for Rukeyser, these activities and forms of expression were linked. As Marilyn Hacker has noted, for Rukeyser \u201cpoetry could encompass both science and history, that of the past and of the present, from the Depression through the anti-war movements in which the poet was active at the end of her career.\u201d Over her five-decade literary career, Rukeyser was central to both American modernism and Leftist political communities. She created new forms of documentary poetics in long poems such as \u201cThe Book of the Dead,\u201d written in response to the Hawk\u2019s Nest Tunnel disaster in 1931 in Gauley Ridge, West Virginia and unique in its use of survivor interviews, court transcripts, and other investigative material. And she was an important figurehead for feminist poets and activists in the 1960s and 1970s, when she mentored scores of younger poets including Alice Walker, Anne Sexton, Sharon Olds, and Adrienne Rich, among many others.\nOf her first collection,\u00a0Theory of Flight (1935),\u00a0winner of the Yale Younger Poets Prize, W.R. Benet remarked in the\u00a0Saturday Review of Literature: \u201cShe is a radical politically, but she writes as a poet not a propagandist. When you hold this book in your hand you hold a living thing.\u201d Some 45 years later,\u00a0Gramercy Review\u00a0contributor Jascha Kessler described Rukeyser as embodying \u201cthe heroic, the bardic, the romantic. \u2026 Poets who are bardic \u2026 take on mankind and the whole cosmos as the field of their utterance, \u2026 [and] try to carry whole nations forward through the urgency of their message. \u2026 Wherever there are hot spots that journalists blow up on the front page\u2014strikes, massacres, revolutions, tortures, wars, prisoners and marches\u2014there is Rukeyser, in the very front line, a spokesperson, or spokespoet perhaps, speaking up loudly for freedom in the world.\u201d She remained a \u201cspokespoet\u201d all of her adult life.\nRukeyser was born in New York City and attended Vassar College, where she was literary editor of the leftist undergraduate journal\u00a0Student Review.\u00a0As a reporter for the journal, Rukeyser covered the 1932 Scottsboro trial in Alabama in which nine black youths were accused of raping two white girls. According to Wolfgang Saxon in his\u00a0New York Times\u00a0obituary of Rukeyser, the Scottsboro incident was the basis of Rukeyser\u2019s poem \u201cThe Trial\u201d and \u201cmay have been the genesis of her commitment to the cause of the underdog and the unjustly condemned.\u201d Following the Scottsboro trial, Rukeyser traveled extensively and moved amongst many different communities and social worlds for the remainder of her life. Among other things, she supported the Spanish Loyalists during the Spanish Civil War where she reported from Barcelona; she was once jailed in Washington for her protests of the Vietnam War; and, as president of the American Center for PEN, she traveled to South Korea in the 1970s to rally against the death sentence of poet Kim Chi-Ha, the incident which later became the framework of one of Rukeyser\u2019s last poems, \u201cThe Gates.\u201d Since she aligned her creative capacities so closely with the current events of her day, a number of reviewers have said that the history of the United States over several decades can be culled from Rukeyser\u2019s poetry.\n\r\nThough frequently incensed by injustice, Rukeyser valued and was capable of an optimism that at times surprised her critics. Rukeyser\u2019s distress at social and political oppression at times \u201cmingled with a romantic\u2019s belief in the perfectibility of the universe, and a young patriot\u2019s belief in the perfectibility of her nation,\u201d wrote Roy B. Hoffman in his\u00a0Village Voice\u00a0review of\u00a0The Collected Poems of Muriel Rukeyser (1978). \u201cPerhaps it is this belief of Rukeyser\u2019s\u2014in a radiant epiphany behind the pain of conflict\u2014that both dates her and makes her refreshing to read. Her idealism is unmarked by heavy irony, cynicism, or an intricacy of wit that characterizes much contemporary poetry.\u201d Contemporary reviewers compared Rukeyser\u2019s style to that of 19th-century American poet\u00a0Walt Whitman. In an assessment of\u00a0Waterlily Fire: Poems, 1935-1962 (1962), a\u00a0Virginia Quarterly Review\u00a0critic explained that \u201clike Whitman, Muriel Rukeyser has so much joy that it is not to be contained in regular verse but comes out in lines that are rugged and soaring.\u201d Contemporary reviewers were frequently dismissive of Rukeyser, often labeling her \u201cemotional,\u201d \u201cprimordial\u201d or \u201cimpassioned\u201d; however, Rukeyser\u2019s interest in \u201cthe politicization of intimate experience,\u201d as the Paris Review\u2019s Sam Huber has claimed, long predated the wide adoption of slogans such as \u201cthe personal is political\u201d in the 1960s.\nRukeyser\u2019s earliest poems contain intrepid research into tone and imagery; this early work tended to feature cluster poems, or collage poems. These poems centered on a single theme but developed in \u201cseparate, autonomous bits, [and] varied in line length and stanza form \u2026 the parts of each book roll[ing] toward the reader in a series of waves, each of which crashes firmly,\u201d explained Alberta Turner in the Dictionary of Literary Biography. In Poetry\u00a0magazine, John Malcolm Brinnin explained that with the publication of\u00a0Theory of Flight, \u201cAmerican poetry found its first full-blown expression of the rebellious temper that prevailed on American campuses and among the younger intellectuals. Its success was immediate. \u2026 Rukeyser was praised for the ruggedness of her technique, her experimentalism, and for the powerful utterance which, from a woman, seemed unique.\u201d Other critics chastised Rukeyser in blatantly misogynist terms. \u201cThis passionate, innocent young woman \u2026 talks so noisily and so hurriedly that it never occurs to her that other people have seen these things before, and have learned to speak more calmly,\u201d wrote\u00a0Michael Roberts\u00a0in his\u00a0Spectator\u00a0review of\u00a0Theory of Flight.\nMore recent poetry criticism has repositioned Rukeyser as an important figure not only in second-wave feminism, but also in shaping an entire generation of innovative poetics. Though Rukeyser\u2019s overtly political poems could attempt to \u201ccarry whole nations forward through the urgency of their message,\u201d her more intimate or small-scale works insisted the personal and political belonged in the same fields of reference. Many of her poems focused on her role as a mother and daughter, explored sexuality, creativity, the poetic process, and illness and death, and they frequently utilized symbolic networks drawn from myth and dreamwork as well as striving to \u201crepresent the obligations and demands of a dense public world from the private vantage of intimate experience,\u201d in the words of Huber. In her book\u00a0Beast in View (1944),\u00a0the poem \u201cAjanta\u201d is \u201cpurportedly\u201d a poem about painted caves in India, \u201cbut when she wrote it,\u201d noted Kenneth Rexroth, \u201cMuriel had never been to India. \u2026 \u2018Ajanta\u2019 is an exploration \u2026 of her own interior\u2014in every sense. It is the interior of her mind as a human being, as a poet, and as a woman.\u201d\nIn the same way that Rukeyser\u2019s poetry was various\u2014labeled, among other things, as romantic, political, feminist, erotic, Whitmanesque\u2014her oeuvre explored a variety of genres. Although known best for her poetry, Rukeyser wrote biographical material (which was sometimes in the form of poetry), children\u2019s books, plays, and television scripts, and she also translated poetry from the Swedish, French, German, Spanish, and Italian. In addition, she taught and read her poetry at institutions nationwide.\nRukeyser\u2019s work as a biographer also received critical attention. As\u00a0Jane Cooper\u00a0noted in the\u00a0Washington Post Book World,\u00a0Rukeyser \u201cloved science and history and modern technology, enjoying their puzzles and solvings much as she enjoyed the puzzles and solvings of poetic form.\u201d Rukeyser wrote about a wide range of individuals: from memorable poems about the German lithographer K\u00e4the Kollwitz, American composer Charles Ives, and mythological figures like Orpheus to profiles of New England eccentric Lord Timothy Dexter, 19th-century mathematician Willard Gibbs, English mathematician and scientist Thomas Hariot, and lawyer and business executive Wendell Willkie, who ran for president on the 1940 Republican party ticket. Indeed, Rukeyser wrote full-length biographies of the latter three men.\nOne of Rukeyser\u2019s intentions behind writing biographies of nonliterary persons was to find a meeting place between science and poetry. In an analysis of Rukeyser\u2019s The Life of Poetry,\u00a0Virginia Terris argued that Rukeyser believed that in the West, poetry and science are wrongly considered to be in opposition to one another. Thus, writes Terris, \u201cRukeyser [set] forth her theoretical acceptance of science \u2026 [and pointed] out the many parallels between [poetry and science]\u2014unity within themselves, symbolic language, selectivity, the use of the imagination in formulating concepts and in execution. Both, she believe[d], ultimately contribute to one another.\u201d For many, Rukeyser\u2019s biographies illuminated their subject in revelatory ways. Reviewing Rukeyser\u2019s account entitled\u00a0The Traces of Thomas Hariot,\u00a0Washington Post Book World\u00a0critic Vincent Cronin wrote: \u201cBy her carefully controlled imaginative sympathy, by the dazzling range of her learning, and above all by the poetry of her style she leads the reader further than he is ever likely to go into the speculative 17th century, where daring men were trying, on half-a-dozen fronts, to break through into what was to become the modern world. \u2026 From now on, thanks to this highly enjoyable trail-blazing book, Thomas Hariot will never be \u2018just another minor Elizabethan.\u2019\u201d Commonweal\u00a0reviewer E.L. Keyes called Rukeyser\u2019s biography of Willard Gibbs an \u201cintelligible collation of a mountain of mysteries.\u201d\n\r\nImpassioned, self-confident, eclectic, a poet of powerful expression, a poet of the political and the personal\u2014these and similar phrases have characterized the life and work of Muriel Rukeyser for decades. Although critics in Rukeyser\u2019s early years seldom agreed on the value of her achievements, a new generation of reviewers had come along by the time Rukeyser published\u00a0The Collected Poems in 1978. A year before Rukeyser\u2019s death, Hoffman concluded that \u201cpoems like \u2018The Poem as Mask\u2019 make me wonder if Muriel Rukeyser is not our greatest living American poet.\u00a0The Collected Poems\u00a0\u2026 enable us to see a breadth of history, energy, and experience rarely matched in American letters.\u201d As for Kessler, \u201cany reading of [Rukeyser\u2019s] poems will excite the best and most ingenious impulses of \u2026 people everywhere, who want goodness and freedom and love in the world and in their own personal lives. Rukeyser remained faithful and consistent with her own youthful visions, and all this work [in\u00a0The Collected Poems] \u2026 testifies to that.\u201d\nAfter her death in 1980, Rukeyser\u2019s work suffered critical and popular neglect; while Rukeyser \u201carticulated the thoughts and feelings of the unnoticed and excluded,\u201d wrote Anna Herzog in The Women\u2019s Review of Books, she was also \u201cone of this country\u2019s most distinguished, misunderstood and undervalued poets.\u201d However, Rukeyser\u2019s body of work has emerged as particularly vital and important to poets and scholars in the first decades of the 21st century. Lee Upton observed in\u00a0Belles Lettres that Rukeyser \u201cgives voice to the repressed, particularly to the lives of women and the marginalized.\u201d And in the Paris Review, Sam Huber noted that, in the aftermath of the 2016 election, Rukeyser\u2019s \u201cPoem\u201d from her collection The Speed of Darkness (1968) has \u201cbecome a vehicle for anti-Trump sentiment, an equivocal fate for any artifact but one Rukeyser would not likely have chafed against. Throughout her career, she remained sensitized to a political and cultural landscape that was changing rapidly.\u201d Her work remains an urgent dispatch for readers struggling to make sense of multiple, volatile political, humanitarian, and environmental crises.\nPosthumous volumes and editions of Rukeyser\u2019s work include Out of Silence: Selected Poems (1992), A Muriel Rukeyser Reader (1994), the Library of America edition of Selected Poems (2004) with an introduction by Adrienne Rich, and the republication of the Collected Poems (2006) and The Book of the Dead (2018).\n", "attrs": {}}
