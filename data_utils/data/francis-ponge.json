He has been called \u201cthe poet of things\u201d because simple objects like a plant, a shell, a cigarette, a pebble, or a piece of soap are the subjects of his prose poems. His many poetry collections include Selected Poems (1994), Vegetation (1987), Rain: A Prose Poem (1969), and Soap (1967). He received the French Academy\u2019s grand prize for poetry in 1972 and the Grand Prize of the Society of Letters in 1985.\nFor Ponge, all objects \u201cyearn to express themselves, and they mutely await the coming of the word so that they may reveal the hidden depths of their being,\u201d as Richard Stamelman explained it in Books Abroad. David Gascoyne, a contributor to Reference Guide to World Literature, declared,\u00a0\u201cTo transmute commonplace objects by a process of replacing inattention with contemplation was Ponge\u2019s way of heeding Ezra Pound\u2019s edict: \u2018Make it new.\u2019 His ever-renewed attempts to celebrate objects of everyday experience in a language enlightened by puns and complex words, with onomatopoeia, and the calligrammatic, were not a restless search for novelty but rather a way of transcending \u2018modernity\u2019 and restoring a Wordsworthian appreciation of the simple things in life: slate, the Seine, asparagus, and tables.\u201d\n\r\n\u201cWhat has an imperious fascination for [Ponge],\u201d observed Betty Miller, \u201cis the essence of the interior life of the plant or shell, so that we feel in reading him almost as though it were the plant which spoke to express miraculously, without human intervention, its personality.\u201d Robert Bly noted in the Georgia Review that Ponge\u2019s prose poems also exposed the hidden relationship between the inner life of human beings and the world of objects. \u201cIt is as if,\u201d Bly wrote, \u201cthe object itself, a stump or an orange, has links with the human psyche, and the unconscious provides material it would not give if asked directly. The unconscious passes into the object and returns.\u201d Gascoyne called Ponge \u201cAn epicurean of language,\u201d yet one who \u201cresisted all accusations of elitism. He addressed himself to the common reader in the hope of persuading us that poetry is not merely a preoccupation of the idle and overeducated.\u201d\n\r\nThroughout his 45-year writing career, Ponge was faithful to his unique approach to poetic subject. Speaking of the poet\u2019s collected works, Sarah N. Lawall in Contemporary Literature found that \u201cwhat Ponge has to say remains quite consistent, and his collected works juxtapose texts from 1921 to 1967 without any contradiction whatsoever. He still goes to the \u2018mute world\u2019 of things for his peculiar dialectic, and he still celebrates the creative power of speech.\u201d Lawall found, too, that Ponge\u2019s work served as an \u201cexample of systematically individual perception and expression in a world threatened by group morality and intellectual totalitarianism.\u201d\n\r\nPerhaps the most obsessive example of Ponge\u2019s approach is to be found in his collection Le Savon (1967), translated as Soap (1969). In this collection, each prose poem considers a different aspect of the life of a bar of soap, detailing each one from the soap\u2019s perspective. When used for washing, the soap becomes sudsy with joyous exuberance; when left alone, it grows hard, dry and cracked. In addition, Ponge makes clear to the reader that their shared experience in the text has been nothing more than a linguistic experience having nothing to do with the object ostensibly being discussed. As Lawall explained, Ponge \u201cdevelops a series of comparisons to show how the reader\u2019s pleasure has come from his sense of playing a game, that the extreme form of this game is \u2018poetry, the purely verbal game which neither imitates nor represents \u201clife,\u201d\u2019 and that \u2018words and figures of speech\u2019 resemble other human concoctions like bread, soap, and electricity.\u201d\n\r\nOther critics also noted this close relationship between Ponge\u2019s poems and the objects they discuss. Michael Benedikt, writing in The Prose Poem: An International Anthology, concluded that Ponge\u2019s poems are \u201cas \u2018objective\u2019 as objects in the world themselves.\u201d Robert W. Greene, in his book Six French Poets of Our Time: A Critical and Historical Study, argued that in many of his poems, Ponge tries \u201cto create a verbal machine that will have as much local intricacy as its counterpart in the world of objects.\u201d Stamelman went even further in analyzing this relationship. \u201cIn Ponge\u2019s poetry,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe text refers to itself and to itself alone \u2026 The only thing the text \u2018represents\u2019 is its own surging into being through language, its own act of expression. Ultimately, the text signifies itself.\u201d\n\r\nPonge\u2019s prose poems follow no set formula. They develop instead in a seemingly spontaneous manner, following a meandering path to their completion. \u201cPonge may be the first poet,\u201d James Merrill wrote in the New York Review of Books, \u201cever to expose so openly the machinery of a poem, to present his revisions, blind alleys, critical asides, and accidental felicities as part of a text perfected, as it were, without \u2018finish\u2019.\u201d Greene acknowledged that Ponge\u2019s \u201ctexts hardly conform to most conceptions of what poems, even prose poems, are or should be. They contain puns, false starts, repetitions, agendas, recapitulations, syllogistic overtones, a heavy ideological content, and other features that one normally associates with prose\u2014and the prose of argumentation at that\u2014rather than with poetry.\u201d\n\r\nAs Bly concluded, \u201cPonge doesn\u2019t try to be cool, distant, or objective, nor does he \u2018let the object speak for itself.\u2019 His poems are funny, his vocabulary immense, his personality full of quirks, and yet the poem remains somewhere in the place where the senses join the object.\u201d Benedikt noted that, \u201cwith Michaux, Ponge is regarded as one of the most significant mid-century French poets.\u201d\n\r\nPonge spent the last 30 years of his life as a recluse at his country home, Mas des Vergers. He suffered from frequent bouts with nervous exhaustion and numerous psychosomatic illnesses. He continued to write up until his death on August 6, 1988, and the work he was involved with at the time was published posthumously in 1991. Entitled La Table, it \u201creflects what was Ponge\u2019s undying, and increasingly obsessional, quest for le mot juste,\u201d mused Gascoyne. \u201cIts final sentence reads: \u2018O Table, ma console et ma consolatrice, table qui me console, ou je me consolide.\u2019 For Ponge, his final subject was his writing table, which had in fact by then become his entire world.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"]}}
