She earned a BA from Wesleyan University and an MFA from California College of the Arts. She is the author of six books of poetry, including Fruitlands (2006), winner of the Poetry Society of America\u2019s Norma Farber First Book Award, Unbecoming Behavior (2008), and I Mean (2015).\nWary of easy similes and life summaries, Colby writes poems in Unbecoming Behavior that are based on the biography of the writer Jane Bowles. Denise Dooley, reviewing the book for galatea resurrection, described it as a \u201cproject of spliced sound, color, and ventriloquized experience.\u201d In other poems, Colby has incorporated accounts of Isadora Duncan, Anna Anderson, Catherine de Medici, Sarah Winchester, and the Transcendentalist community at Fruitlands as she recontextualizes these accounts within personal details and writings on the contemporary world.\nShe has received fellowships from the Rhode Island State Council for the Arts and Harvard\u2019s Woodberry Poetry Room, and her work has been featured at the Beauport Sleeper-McCann, deCordova, Isabella Stewart Gardner and RISD museums. Her poems and essays have appeared in Bennington Review, Columbia Poetry Review, PEN America, The Rumpus, Verse and the DIA Readings in Contemporary Poetry Anthology, among other journals and anthologies. She was a founding board member of the Gloucester Writers Center in Massachusetts and currently lives in Providence, where she works as a copywriter and editor.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
