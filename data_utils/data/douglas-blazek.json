Early in his career, Blazek published hundreds of poems in dozens of books, chapbooks, and journals, including New Directions, TriQuarterly, and many more little magazines that, in Blazek\u2019s words, \u201ccontributed to the ferment of the Sixties.\u201d Blazek also founded and edited the magazine Ole and the small press Open Skull. As an editor, Blazek published work by Charles Bukowski, Robert Crumb, d.a. levy, and other non-establishment writers.  \u00a0 In the 1980s, Blazek stopped publishing and began a period of intense rewriting. Of this process, Blazek has said: \u201cOver the years, new poems were spliced into the manuscripts I was rewriting\u2026 No old poem is old.\u00a0Each is as fresh as if never breathed before, yet preserves the bones its body first owned in its natality.\u201d\u00a0Aperture Mirror (2012) and The Blindfold Alphabet (2014) are the first books of Blazek\u2019s rewritings.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {}}
