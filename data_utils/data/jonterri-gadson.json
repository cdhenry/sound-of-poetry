She is the author of the chapbooks Interruptions (2014) and Pepper Girl (2012). Her full-length poetry collection, Blues Triumphant (2016), explores the triumphs and demands of motherhood and identity. In an interview with the Rumpus, Gadson explained the impulse behind the book: \u201cI wrote most of these poems by forcing myself to stay awake after I completed my son\u2019s lengthy bed time rituals with him. I would force myself to write for two hours. I had so much anxiety that I was failing \u2026 failing him, failing myself so I would honestly ask myself, \u2018What am I most afraid to say?\u2019 and then I would write poems about what I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to hear me saying out loud.\u201d\nGadson is the recipient of scholarships and fellowships from Cave Canem, the Bread Loaf Writers\u2019 Conference, the University of Dayton, and the University of Virginia. As an assistant professor at Bloomfield College, she codirected the workshop series, Writing from the Margins. Gadson also writes for an all-female comedy panel show; in 2016 she was selected for the NBC Late Night Writer\u2019s Workshop.\n", "attrs": {}}
