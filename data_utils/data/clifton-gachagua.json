His debut poetry collection, The Madman at Kilifi (2014), was chosen for the inaugural Sillerman First Book Prize for African Poets by the African Poetry Book Fund & Series. In his foreword to the collection, poet Kwame Dawes stated, \u201cGachagua\u2019s poems are urgently present; they emerge out of sources like the radio, newspaper, television, as well as street stories and rumours. They seek to chart a changing society and while the effort is largely impossible to accomplish, the gesture is important. One of Gachagua\u2019s whimsical speakers describes himself as a \u201ccartographer of water,\u201d and in this Gachagua seems to have found the fit metaphor for his art\u2014quixotic, absurd, and yet necessary.\u201d \u201cWriting poetry [\u2026] has been about finding a way to live and sustain my life,\u201d said Gachagua in a 2014 interview with Evan Mwangi for the Standard Digital News (Kenya). \u201cThere are certain ways language can make life\u2019s obscurities, pains, and incoherence map-able. That\u2019s always what I\u2019m after.\u201d  \u00a0 Gachagua is a member of the pan-African writing collective Jalada. A writer for the broadcast television shows Sumu La Penzi and Jane & Abel, he lives in Nairobi.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Africa"]}}
