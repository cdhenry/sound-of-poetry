Her work draws on her rich Korean-Chinese ancestry as well as her experiences as an American and a woman. In poems that have been compared by critics to the muted tints of watercolor paintings, Song has consistently created a world rich with narrative and imagery. Her first volume of poems, Picture Bride, won the 1982 Yale Series of Younger Poets Award and was also nominated for that year\u2019s National Book Critics Circle Award. Her other collections include Cloud Moving Hands (2007), The Land of Bliss (2001), School Figures (1994), and Frameless Windows, Squares of Light (1988). In 1994, she received the Shelley Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America. She is also the author of the short story collection\u00a0All the Love in the World (2020).\nSong\u2019s father was a pilot and the family traveled extensively during her youth. In interviews, Song has credited her early interest in writing to her family\u2019s travels: \u201cOur family travels started my writing. I guess I was around nine years old when I decided I wanted to be the family chronicler.\u201d Her interest and talent were encouraged by her high school teacher, the Hart Crane biographer John Unterecker. Song attended Wellesley College and earned an MFA from Boston University. She met her husband, a medical student at Tufts University, while in Boston. The couple moved to Denver, Colorado, in 1984 while he completed his residency at Denver General Hospital, and there Song wrote Frameless Windows, Squares of Light (1988). In 1987 they returned to Honolulu.\nSong\u2019s poetic oeuvre is united by her abiding focus on family. The moral ties that bind women to children and parents, to their community, to tradition, and to the land are continuously interwoven throughout her verse. In the title poem from Picture Bride, for example, Song recalls the story of her grandparents. At age 23, Song\u2019s grandmother was sent to the United States from Korea in an arranged marriage through the exchange of photographs; her husband, a Chinese immigrant who worked on a Hawaiian plantation, was much older. Much of the book addresses such family relationships. Shirley Lim, in a review of the book in Asian American Literature, commented, \u201cSong\u2019s greatest strength lies in this marvelous organic nature of her imagery and in the complete fusion of form, image, occasion, and emotion. Every poem is marked by this naturalness of form, based unpretentiously on phrasal pauses or the breadth of a line, by an unforced storyline or ease of observation; almost every poem has a sudden eruption of metaphor, which startles, teases, illuminates.\u201d\nFrameless Windows, Squares of Light (1988) continues to explore family history and relationships; as Booklist reviewer Pat Monaghan noted, \u201cSong explores the nuances of intimacy with admirable clarity and passion.\u201d Song\u2019s poem \u201cA Mehinaku Girl in Seclusion\u201d describes a girl\u2019s coming of age and subsequent removal from her tribe for three years in order to be \u201cmarried to the earth.\u201d Reviewer Jessica Greenbaum\u00a0noted in Women\u2019s Review of Books that \u201cA Mehinaku Girl\u201d deftly draws the reader into the inner life of its main character.\nIn School Figures (1994) Song again casts the stories of her family in verse. Both \u201cA Conservative View\u201d and \u201cJourney\u201d explore challenges that her parents faced. The thoughts, feelings, and impressions couched within each of Song\u2019s poems\u2014whether quietly coming to terms with the death of a father or sitting amid the clatter of serving dishes and the buoyant chatter of family during dinner\u2014are transformed by the poet into universal images, transcending labels of race, gender, and culture. Song\u2019s collection The Land of Bliss (2001) is shot through with familial and autobiographical themes. Rochelle Ratner, reviewing the collection for Library Journal, commented that here, Song \u201cmagnificently intertwines the harsh reality of her aging parents (including a mother frequently hospitalized for depression) with memories of her grandparents.\u201d Ratner considered the longer autobiographical poems to be \u201csome of the finest this reviewer has read in recent memory.\u201d\nCloud Moving Hands (2007), Song\u2019s fifth book, takes its name from a tai chi movement, and is informed by Buddhism. As Eric McHenry noted in the New York Times Book Review, the work is \u201cpreoccupied with suffering\u2014as itself and as an opportunity for change.\u201d McHenry praised Song\u2019s shorter poems in the belief that \u201cSong is at her best when her poems are most\u2014pun unavoidable\u2014songlike, or when she\u2019s imagining other lives.\u201d The poet Li Young-Lee added, \u201cCloud Moving Hands is Song\u2019s best work. More of the heart and mind and soul are integrated than ever. More finely seen differentiations arise. Deeper chords are struck. She moves more and more into the unknown. This book is a gift to her readers.\u201d\u00a0\nSong is a noted teacher and leader of creative writing workshops through Hawaii\u2019s \u201cPoets in the Schools\u201d program. Of her work with the program Song has said, \u201cI\u2019m not there to give [the students] false praise. It\u2019s not going to do them any good ... Sometimes I tell them to rewrite something over and over, and they do, creating a really good poem. You\u2019ve got to be willing to dismantle ... to realize that poetry is something made outside of yourself.\u201d\nSong lives in Honolulu and teaches at the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Pacific Islands"]}}
