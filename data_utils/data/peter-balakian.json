His poems have been widely anthologized, including in the 1985 Morrow Anthology of Younger American Poets, and have been translated into several languages. He has published essays on poetry, culture, and art in numerous journals, and is the author of Theodore Roethke\u2019s Far Fields (1989). He earned a BA from Bucknell University, an MA from New York University, and a PhD in American civilization from Brown University.\n\r\nBalakian grew up in the suburbs of Tenafly, New Jersey, the son of Armenian parents. As a child he heard scraps of his grandmother Nafina\u2019s past\u2014Balakian credits his love of writing to her storytelling and imagery\u2014but he didn\u2019t discover the Armenian genocide of the early 20th century until he read Ambassador Morgenthau\u2019s Story, the memoir of the U.S. ambassador to Turkey during that period. Shortly thereafter, Balakian learned that his grandmother had been one of the few survivors of a death march in the Syrian desert. Balakian\u2019s memoir of his quest to learn more about his family\u2019s connection to the genocide and diaspora, Black Dog of Fate (1997), won the PEN/Martha Albrand Prize for Memoir and was a New York Times Notable Book. The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America\u2019s Response (2003) received the 2005 Raphael Lemkin Prize. He translated, with Nevart Yaghlian, the Armenian poet Siamanto\u2019s Bloody News from My Friend (tr. 1996), a cycle of poems inspired by letters that Balakian\u2019s grandfather, a doctor, wrote to his parents while he tended survivors in the wake of a 1909 massacre. Balakian also edited the Armenian Genocide section of the Norton anthology Against Forgetting: Twentieth Century Poetry of Witness (1993).\n\r\nInfluenced by poets as diverse as Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Pablo Neruda and the 10th-century Armenian poet Gregory of Nareg, Balakian uses poetry to explore, in his own words, \u201cthe parameters of consciousness in our particular time.\u201d Acknowledging the challenge in writing poetry steeped in the political, Balakian notes that \u201cit is always necessary to keep aesthetic issues free from polemics and simple politics. Poetry should never be editorial. Poetry must be faithful to the richness of language, poetic form, and the complexity of experience. But the political sphere should deepen a writer and make his or her work larger, richer, and morally resonant.\u201d\n\r\nReviewing Sad Days of Light (1983), James Dickey observed, \u201cAt last, poetry about genocide that is truly, in every thrust, pause and detail, real poetry. Mr. Balakian\u2019s bloodlines from Armenia are blazing here; the language is incandescent with rage, grief, helplessness and love. This is an extraordinary book, and Mr. Balakian\u2019s an extraordinary talent.\u201d The 2016 Pulitzer Prize citation remarked that\u00a0Ozone Journal includes\u201cpoems that bear witness to the old losses and tragedies that undergird a global age of danger and uncertainty.\u201d\n\r\nBalakian has won the New Jersey Council for the Humanities Book Award and an award from the Academy of American Poets, as well as fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. He cofounded and coedited The Graham House Review with Bruce Smith from 1976 to 1996 and was awarded an editing grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
