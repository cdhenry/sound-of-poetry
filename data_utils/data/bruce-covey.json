Influenced by John Ashbery and Ron Padgett, Covey\u2019s poems often utilize narrative and sequence, sometimes engaging found text, with both playfulness and urgency. Reviewing Glass Is Really a Liquid for the Rumpus, Weston Cutter noted that Covey\u2019s poems \u201cmake sense, fundamentally, but they\u2019ve got a strange, skittering-away sense to them, a resistance to being pinned down.\u201dCovey is the author of several collections of poetry, including Glass Is Really a Liquid (2010), Elapsing Speedway Organism (2006), and The Greek Gods as Telephone Wires (1992). The editor of the online poetry journal Coconut and its sister press, Coconut Books, Covey has taught at the Atlanta College of Art and Emory University, where he also serves as senior director of technical services for campus life. He lives in Atlanta.\ufeff\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"]}}
