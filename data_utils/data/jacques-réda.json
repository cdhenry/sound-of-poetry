He is an eminent literary figure in Europe, especially in his home country. The author of over 50 books of poetry and prose, he focuses much of his writing on the banality of life. He also has written extensively in both forms about jazz. R\u00e9da has received numerous awards, including the French Academy\u2019s Grand Prix in 1993 and the Bourse Goncourt de la Po\u00e9sie in 1999. From 1987 to 1996, he was chief editor of the Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise.\nR\u00e9da is widely known for his observations of the life around him as he travels throughout urban and suburban environments, especially those of Paris. One of his most highly praised volumes of poetry is La tourney (1975), in which the long prose poem focuses on \u201cthe poet in search of the town as mandala,\u201d as noted by Graham Martin in the Times Literary Supplement. Martin also noted that the author \u201cis a poet who makes the uncanny almost approachable.\u201d E. Sellin, writing in World Literature Today, commented that the author\u2019s \u201cpoems remain \u2018modern\u2019 even as they move inexorably through set postures.\u201d\n\r\nIn his book Hors les murs: po\u00e8mes (1982), R\u00e9da focuses on the environs of Paris and its people. Writing in World Literature Today, Michael Bishop noted that the \u201cpoems, however, are by no means just catenations of observations, events, the strictly definable,\u201d adding that the poems have \u201can airiness, a quick metaphoricalness attuned to the restless metamorphic nature of city life.\u201d Retour au calme: po\u00e8mes (1989) is a collection of poems that, according to World Literature Today contributor Maryann De Julio, reflect the author\u2019s love of Jazz through the poems\u2019 \u201cemphasis on rhythm and voice.\u201d De Julio also was interested in how the author \u201cthematizes the temporality of language to express the metaphysical aspects of writing.\u201d\n\r\nIn many of the poems in the collection Lettre sur l\u2019univers: et autres discours en vers fran\u00e7ais (1991), the author casts a contrasting eye on modern life versus what he views as a more natural lifestyle of earlier times. De Julio, once again writing in World Literature Today, noted that the volume \u201cconfirms what we have come to expect from Jacques R\u00e9da, a poet whose predilection for jazz finds rhythm in a disparate collection of voices.\u201d De Julio also commented on the author\u2019s \u201crapt attention to detail.\u201d French Review contributor Sara Lawall noted that the volume \u201ccombines metaphysical ambitions with a degree of self-deprecating irony.\u201d Lawall went on to note that the volume\u2014along with another collection titled Un calendrier \u00e9l\u00e9giaque (1991)\u2014contains \u201ca colorful, intelligent, peripatetic, and somewhat didactic poetic voice.\u201d In 2005, the first English edition of the author\u2019s early poems was published in a volume titled Treading Lightly: Selected Poems, 1961-1975. Referring to the volume as \u201coutstanding,\u201d Guardian contributor Sara Crown called the poems \u201clucent and exquisite.\u201d\n\r\nMuch of the author\u2019s prose also focuses on Paris and its environs. In Le citadin: chronique (1998) for example, the author provides vignettes related to his travels throughout Paris and its suburbs. Organized into four cycles that coincide with the four seasons, the writings are \u201cparticularly attentive to silence, words, and music,\u201d as noted by De Julio in World Literature Today. De Julio went on to comment that the book \u201cprobes the limits of the city, its language, and its uncanniness.\u201d\n\nLes ruines de Paris (1977), published in English as The Ruins of Paris (1996), contains both prose vignettes and some verse and looks at many of the less glamorous districts of Paris. Writing in World Literature Today, E. Selling called the book \u201ca fresh, closeup look ... in the tradition of love-hate relationships.\u201d In his sequel to The Ruins of Paris titled La libert\u00e9 des rues (1997), R\u00e9da further explores Paris\u2019s side streets and shops and, as noted by John Taylor of the Times Literary Supplement, \u201creveals himself to be a sensitive observer of people as well.\u201d Commenting on the two volumes together, Taylor wrote that they allow the author \u201cnot only [to] conjure up a thoroughly genuine Paris, but also enable him to confront the bleak nihilism of our times.\u201d\n\r\nIn Aller aux mirabelles (1991), R\u00e9da pays homage to the area of France where he was born as he reflects on a weekend visit with his family in a small village. Jonathan F. Krell, writing in the French Review, commented that the author \u201cleads the reader on a poignant ... trip.\u201d Krell went on to write that the author \u201cimparts a magical grandeur to the Lorrain countryside.\u201d Times Literary Supplement contributor Taylor praised the author\u2019s \u201cvivid cameos of old acquaintances encountered in the street.\u201d Taylor added, \u201cMoving leitmotivs give structure and continuity to this charming book.\u201d In another book focusing on his origins titled L\u2019herbe des talus (1984), R\u00e9da recalls the time of his life from his boyhood to his mid twenties. Ian Bell, writing in the Times Literary Supplement, noted that the author\u2019s \u201callusive and sometimes hermetic style transfigures even the most earthy of the characters he recalls.\u201d\n\r\nR\u00e9da has also written fiction, including Accidents de la circulation: r\u00e9cits (2001), which is a fictional travelogue of Reda\u2019s sojourns throughout Paris and its outlying suburbs. Writing in World Literature Today, Allen Thiher noted that the book contains \u201cnarratives only in the sense that they narrate a walk ... or a trip during which what happens is essentially what Reda sees or smells or captures, as if he were on a hunt for the essence of ephemeral things.\u201d In the novel Aller au diable: roman (2002), the young narrator begins his story during World War II and recounts his coming of age and the many people who influence him, including a series of women with whom he has primarily platonic relationships. World Literature Today contributor Warren Motte noted that the novel \u201cconfirms [R\u00e9da\u2019s] reputation as one of the most interesting French stylists writing today.\u201d Another novel, titled Aller \u00e0 Elisabethville (1993), takes place during the German occupation of France. John Taylor, writing in the Review of Contemporary Fiction, noted, \u201cWritten in vivid, intense prose ... Aller \u00e0 Elisabethville: r\u00e9cit offers a sincere, genuine, persuasive and original recounting of the civilian experience of war.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"]}}
