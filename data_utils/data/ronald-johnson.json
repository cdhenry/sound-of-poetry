His first book of poetry was A Line of Poetry, A Row of Trees (1964). Subsequent volumes included The Book of the Green Man (1967); Valley of the Many-Colored Grasses (1969); an erasure of Paradise Lost entitled RADI OS (1977; 2005); the 99-part metaphysical poem, ARK (1980, 1984, 1996, 2014), based on architectural features\u2014among them the Palais Id\u00e9al in Hauterives, France, and the Watts Towers in Los Angeles; and The Shrubberies (2001). He is best known today for his experimental poetics and his magnum opus, ARK.\nJohnson attended the University of Kansas, then moved to New York City where he earned his BA at Columbia University in 1960. Johnson hiked the Appalachian Trail from Springer Mountain, Georgia, to the Hudson River in New York in the summer of 1961 with the poet and publisher Jonathan Williams. They traveled and lived in England in the early 1960s, hiking the Lake District for five weeks in 1962. Johnson lived in San Francisco for 25 years before returning to Topeka in 1993, where he lived until his death in 1998.\nJohnson\u2019s early works used quotation and collage to innovate on Romantic, visionary, and pastoral verse traditions; his later collections drew on discourses from fields such as natural science, psychology, architecture, music, and philosophy. In a contemporary review of The Green Man in the Saturday Review, Charles Philbrick dubbed it a \u201cmost unusual volume \u2026 which is both original and profoundly traditional. The reader becomes absorbed in the young Kansan as he tramps through the English countryside, discovering it with eyes that record the sights of a year\u2019s visit and that have also drawn into his brain the recorded lore of centuries. \u2026 Mr. Johnson has worked into his poem the writings of a multitude who knew \u2018the green man\u2019\u2014from Giraldus Cambrensis to Tolkien, and including Vaughan, Smart, Blake, and the Wordsworths.\u201d And Dan Jaffe commented in the Saturday Review on Johnson\u2019s Valley of the Many-Colored Grasses: \u201cThese are symbolist poems in intention, but they are informed by the facts of art and flora.\u201d\nJohnson\u2019s RADI OS, an erasure (where a text is composed by erasing words or lines of a source) of John Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost, was inspired by Lukas Foss\u2019s \u201cBaroque Variations.\u201d In an interview with Peter O\u2019Leary, Johnson noted that Foss\u2019s \u201cstrategy was to take Handel and erase things so that it had a modern, modish feel, but it was definitely Handle. It was really neoclassical in some odd way. So I went off to think about it and the next day I went to the bookstore and bought Paradise Lost. And I started crossing it out. I got about halfway through, kind of as a joke. But I decided you don\u2019t tamper with Milton to be funny. You have to be serious.\u201d \u201cThe four books of Paradise Lost that make up RADI OS,\u201d according to Eric Murphy Selinger, \u201ccan be read as a covert or implicit narrative: both as a running commentary on Milton and as a story of creation and the human fall into a sleepy forgetfulness, which the visionary poet will teach us to wake up from and ascend to our true stature.\u201d Long out of print, RADI OS was republished in 2005. Reviewing the new edition in the Boston Review, Dan Beachy-Quick noted the interconnections between reading and writing modeled by Johnson\u2019s work: \u201cpart of what is so remarkable in Johnson\u2019s project,\u201d he remarked, \u201cis the empowering sense that any genuine reading of such a work as Paradise Lost accomplishes within each reader a similar work: a reading as individual as the mind that reads.\u201d\nJohnson\u2019s epic work, ARK, was published in its entirety twice: first by a small press run out of an Albuquerque bookshop in the 1980s and 90s, and in 2014 by Flood Editions. Comprised of short sections Johnson called \u201cbeams\u201d or \u201cramparts,\u201d the book draws on techniques such as collage and juxtaposition and includes concrete, prose, and lyric poems as well as many attributed and unattributed quotations; Johnson described the long poem as \u201cfilled with snippets: things from books, things on television \u2026 I keep my ears open and my eyes open and when I see or hear something I write it down in my notebook. It somehow is almost stitched out (if anybody could figure out from those notebooks\u2014I don\u2019t know what their series is), it knits out.\u201d Reviewing ARK for the New Yorker, Stephanie Burt remarked that \u201cof all the ambitious, syncretic, idiosyncratic, American modernist long poems (and we have had more than a few), \u2018ARK\u2019 is the most spiritual, the most celebratory, and maybe the most fun. This world, it insists, \u2018is paradise, / odd words in legion / beating around the veritable bush\u2019 (that is, the burning bush). Divided into short lines as if by a \u2018JIGSAW YAHWEH JESTER,\u2019 the sometimes puzzling \u2018beams\u2019 and \u2018ramparts\u2019 are also a compilation of praise poems, ways to admire reality. We know what advice \u2018ARK \u2018gives us (\u2018delight! delight! delight! / doubt reduced to dust\u2019) but cannot predict what evidence will come next.\u201d\nIn addition to occasional teaching stints, Ronald Johnson worked as a chef and caterer. He was the author of the cookbooks The American Table (1984), Southwestern Cooking: New and Old (1985), Simple Fare (1989), and Company Fare (1991). On his return to Topeka, Johnson worked as a cookie baker at Ward-Meade Park. His last volume of poems, The Shrubberies, was inspired by the gardens there. He died in 1998 in Kansas.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
