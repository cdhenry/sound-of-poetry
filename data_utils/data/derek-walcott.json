He published his first poem in the local newspaper at the age of 14. Five years later, he borrowed $200 to print his first collection, 25 Poems, which he distributed on street corners. Walcott\u2019s major breakthrough came with the collection In a Green Night: Poems 1948-1960 (1962), a book which celebrates the Caribbean and its history as well as investigates the scars of colonialism. Throughout a long and distinguished career, Walcott returned to those same themes of language, power, and place. His later collections include Tiepolo\u2019s Hound (2000), The Prodigal (2004), Selected Poems (2007), White Egrets (2010), and Morning, Paramin (2016). In 1992, Walcott won the Nobel Prize in Literature. The Nobel committee described his work as \u201ca poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment.\u201d\n\r\nSince the 1950s Walcott divided his time between Boston, New York, and Saint Lucia. His work resonates with Western canon and Island influences, shifting between Caribbean patois and English, and often addressing his English and West Indian ancestry. According to Los Angeles Times Book Review contributor Arthur Vogelsang, \u201cThese continuing polarities shoot an electricity to each other which is questioning and beautiful and which helps form a vision altogether Caribbean and international, personal (him to you, you to him), independent, and essential for readers of contemporary literature on all the continents.\u201d Known for his technical control, erudition, and large canvases, Walcott was, according to poet and critic Sean O\u2019Brien, \u201cone of the handful of poets currently at work in English who are capable of making a convincing attempt to write an epic \u2026 His work is conceived on an oceanic scale and one of its fundamental concerns is to give an account of the simultaneous unity and division created by the ocean and by human dealings with it.\u201d\n\r\nMany readers and critics point to Omeros (1990), an epic poem reimagining the Trojan War as a Caribbean fishermen\u2019s fight, as Walcott\u2019s major achievement. The book is \u201can effort to touch every aspect of Caribbean experience,\u201d according to O\u2019Brien who also described it as an ars poetica, concerned \u201cwith art itself\u2014its meaning and importance and the nature of an artistic vocation.\u201d In reviewing Walcott\u2019s Selected Poems (2007), poet Glyn Maxwell ascribes Walcott\u2019s power as a poet not so much to his themes as to his ear: \u201cThe verse is constantly trembling with a sense of the body in time, the self slung across metre, whether metre is steps, or nights, or breath, whether lines are days, or years, or tides.\u201d\n\r\nWalcott was also a renowned playwright. In 1971 he won an Obie Award for his play Dream on Monkey Mountain, which the New Yorker described as \u201ca poem in dramatic form.\u201d Walcott\u2019s plays generally treat aspects of the West Indian experience, often dealing with the socio-political and epistemological implications of post-colonialism and drawing upon various genres such as the fable, allegory, folk, and morality play. With his twin brother, he cofounded the Trinidad Theater Workshop in 1950; in 1981, while teaching at Boston University, he founded the Boston Playwrights\u2019 Theatre. He also taught at Columbia University, Yale University, Rutgers University, and Essex University in England.\n\r\nIn addition to his Nobel Prize, Walcott\u2019s honors included a MacArthur Foundation \u201cgenius\u201d award, a Royal Society of Literature Award, and, in 1988, the Queen\u2019s Medal for Poetry. He was an honorary member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. He died in 2017.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Caribbean"]}}
