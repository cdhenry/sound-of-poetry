But the innermost me is not to be found in any of these. At the end of the journey I am able to see, a little more clearly, the orb of my life. Looking back, the only thing of which I feel certain is that I am a poet (ami kavi).\u201d\nAlthough Nobel Prize-winning poet Tagore prioritized poetry, he also made notable contributions to literature as a dramatist, novelist, short story writer, and writer of nonfictional prose, especially essays, criticism, philosophical treatises, journals, memoirs, and letters. In addition, he expressed himself as musician, painter, actor-producer-director, educator, patriot, and social reformer. Referring to the variety and abundance of Tagore\u2019s creative output, Buddhadeva Bose declared in An Acre of Green Grass, \u201cIt would be trite to call him versatile; to call him prolific very nearly funny.\u201d Bose added, \u201cThe point is not that his writings run into a hundred thousand pages of print, covering every form and aspect of literature, though this matters: he is a source, a waterfall, flowing out in a hundred streams, a hundred rhythms, incessantly.\u201d\nA man of prodigious literary and artistic accomplishments, Tagore played a leading role in Indian cultural renaissance and came to be recognized, along with Mohandas Gandhi, as one of the architects of modern India. India\u2019s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, wrote in Discovery of India, \u201cTagore and Gandhi have undoubtedly been the two outstanding and dominating figures in the first half of the twentieth century. ... [Tagore\u2019s] influence over the mind of India, and especially of successive rising generations has been tremendous. Not Bengali only, the language in which he himself wrote, but all the modern languages of India have been molded partly by his writings. More than any other Indian, he has helped to bring into harmony the ideals of the East and the West, and broadened the bases of Indian nationalism.\u201d\nTagore\u2019s career, extending over a period of more than 60 years, not only chronicled his personal growth and versatility but also reflected the artistic, cultural, and political vicissitudes of India in the late 19th and the first half of the 20th century. Tagore wrote in \u201cMy Life,\u201d an essay collected in Lectures and Addresses (1988), that he \u201cwas born and brought up in an atmosphere of the confluence of three movements, all of which were revolutionary\u201d: the religious reform movement started by Raja Rammohan Roy, the founder of the Bramo Samaj (Society of Worshipers of the One Supreme Being); the literary revolution pioneered by the Bengali novelist Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, who \u201clifted the dead weight of ponderous forms from our language and with a touch of his magic aroused our literature from her age-long sleep\u201d; and the Indian National Movement, protesting the political and cultural dominance of the West. Members of the Tagore family had actively participated in all the three movements, and Tagore\u2019s own work, in a broad sense, represented the culmination of this three-pronged revolution.\nThe earliest influences that shaped Tagore\u2019s poetic sensibility were the artistic environment of his home, the beauty of nature, and the saintly character of his father. \u201cMost members of my family,\u201d he recalled in \u201cMy Life,\u201d \u201chad some gift\u2014some were artists, some poets, some musicians\u2014and the whole atmosphere of our home was permeated with the spirit of creation.\u201d His early education was administered at home under private tutors, but, Tagore wrote in My Boyhood Days (1940), he did not like \u201cthe mills of learning\u201d that \u201cwent on grinding from morn till night.\u201d As a boy, he was admitted to four different schools in Calcutta, but he hated all of them and began frequently to play truant. Nature was his favorite school, as he recorded in \u201cMy Life\u201d: \u201cI had a deep sense, almost from infancy, of the beauty of nature, an intimate feeling of companionship with the trees and the clouds, and felt in tune with the musical touch of the seasons in the air. ... All these craved expression, and naturally I wanted to give them my own expression.\u201d His father, Debendranath, popularly called Maharshi (Great Sage), was a writer, scholar, and mystic, who for many years had been a distinguished leader of the Brahmo Samaj (Theistic Church) movement founded by Raja Rammohan Roy.\nIn Letters to a Friend (1928) Tagore told C.F. Andrews, \u201cI saw my father seldom; he was away a great deal, but his presence pervaded the whole house and was one of the deepest influences on my life.\u201d When Rabindranath was 12 years old, his father took him on a four-month journey to the Punjab and the Himalayas. \u201cThe chains of the rigorous regime which had bound me snapped for good when I set out from home,\u201d he wrote in his Reminiscences. Their first stop was at Bolpur, then an obscure rural retreat, now internationally known as Santiniketan, the seat of Visva-Bharati University founded by Tagore on December 22, 1918. This visit was Tagore\u2019s first contact with rural Bengal, which he later celebrated in his songs. The Tagores\u2019 final destination was Dalhousie, a beautiful resort in the Himalayas. Overwhelmed by the beauty and majesty of the mountains, young Tagore wandered freely from one peak to another. During the sojourn, Debendranath took charge of his son\u2019s education and read with him selections from Sanskrit, Bengali, and English literatures. Debendranath also sang his favorite hymns and recited to Rabindranath verses from the metaphysical Hindu treatises, the Upanishads. Stephen N. Hay surmised, in Asian Ideas of East and West, that \u201cthe special attention Debendranath had paid to his youngest sons\u201d during this trip and the sense of liberation experienced by Rabindranath miraculously transformed him \u201cfrom ugly duckling into much-admired swan.\u201d In Hay\u2019s view, \u201cthe pleasurable memory of sudden recognition consequent to a glamorous journey may have remained for the rest of Rabindranath\u2019s life a stimulus to re-enact this archetypal experience.\u201d\nAmong other influences, Tagore acknowledged three main sources of his literary inspiration: the Vaishnava poets of medieval Bengal and the Bengali folk literature; the classical Indian aesthetic, cultural, and philosophical heritage; and the modern European literary tradition, particularly the work of the English Romantic poets. Underlining Tagore\u2019s many affinities with the European mind, Alexander Aronson, in Rabindranath through Western Eyes, tried to fit him into the Western literary tradition, but, as Edward J. Thompson pointed out in Rabindranath Tagore: Poet and Dramatist, \u201cIndian influences, of course, were the deepest and touched his mind far more constantly than any European ones, and at a thousand points.\u201d Harmoniously blended and synthesized in Rabindranath were the sensuous apprehension and the mythopoeic tendency of the English romantics, the vision of the great mystics of India, the metaphysical quest of the sages of the Upanishads, the aesthetic sensibilities of an ancient poet like Kalidasa, and the devotional spirit of the medieval Vaishnavite poet-saints and the Bauls\u2014mendicant wandering religious minstrels of Bengal.\nTagore began writing poetry at a very early age, and during his lifetime he published nearly 60 volumes of verse, in which he experimented with many poetic forms and techniques\u2014lyric, sonnet, ode, dramatic monologue, dialogue poems, long narrative and descriptive works, and prose poems. \u201cUnfortunately for both the West and for Tagore,\u201d Mary M. Lago pointed out in Rabindranath Tagore, \u201cmany of his readers never knew\u2014still do not know\u2014that so many of his poems were written as words for music, with musical and verbal imagery and rhythms designed to support and enhance each other.\u201d His Gitabitan (\u201cSong Collection\u201d), containing 2,265 songs that were all composed, tuned, and sung by himself, not only started a new genre in Bengali music, known as Rabindrasangit, but, in Lago\u2019s view, became \u201can important demonstration\u201d of his \u201cbelief in the efficacy of cultural synthesis. He used all the musical materials that came to hand: the classical ragas, the boat songs of Bengal, Vaishnava kirtan [group chanting] and Baul devotional songs, village songs of festival and of mourning, even Western tunes picked up during his travels and subtly adapted to his own uses.\u201d Such spirit of experimentation and synthesis marked Tagore\u2019s entire creative career.\nHis first notable book of lyrics, Sandhya Sangit (1882; \u201cEvening Songs\u201d), won the admiration of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee. Tagore later wrote in his Reminiscences, \u201cthe sadness and pain which sought expression in the Evening Songs had their roots in the depth of my being.\u201d The book was closely followed by Prabhat Sangit (1883; \u201cMorning Songs\u201d), in which he celebrated his joy at the discovery of the world around him. The new mood was the outcome of a mystical experience he had had while looking at the sunrise one day: \u201cAs I continued to gaze, all of a sudden a covering seemed to fall away from my eyes, and I found the world bathed in a wonderful radiance, with waves of beauty and joy swelling on every side. This radiance pierced in a moment through the folds of sadness and despondency which had accumulated over my heart, and flooded it with this universal light,\u201d he recalled in Reminiscences. He recounted this experience in greater detail in The Religion of Man: \u201cI felt sure that some Being who comprehended me and my world was seeking his best expression in all my experiences, uniting them into an ever-widening individuality which is a spiritual work of art. To this Being I was responsible; for the creation in me is His as well as mine.\u201d He called this Being his Jivan devata (\u201cThe Lord of His Life\u201d), a new conception of God as man\u2019s intimate friend, lover, and beloved that was to play an important role in his subsequent work.\nHis newly awakened sense of all-pervading joy in the universe expressed itself in Chhabi O Gan (1884; \u201cPictures and Songs\u201d) and Kari O Kamal (1886; \u201cSharps and Flats\u201d), in which he boldly celebrated the human body in such poems as \u201cTanu\u201d (\u201cBody\u201d), \u201cBahu\u201d (\u201cArms\u201d), \u201cChumban\u201d (\u201cThe Kiss\u201d), \u201cStan\u201d (\u201cBreasts\u201d), \u201cDeher Milan\u201d (\u201cPhysical Union\u201d), and \u201cVivasana\u201d (\u201cUndraped Beauty\u201d). He described Kari O Kamal as \u201cthe Song of Humanity standing on the road in front of the gateway of the Palace of Life\u201d and believed it to be an important landmark in the evolution of his poetic outlook. It was, however, his new contemplative, mystical, religious, and metaphysical tone dominating Manasi (1890; \u201cThe Mind\u2019s Creation\u201d), Sonar Tari (1894; \u201cThe Golden Boat\u201d), Chitra (1896), Naivedya (1901; \u201cOfferings\u201d), Kheya (1906; \u201cFerrying Across\u201d), and Gitanjali (1910; Song Offerings) that gave his lyrical poetry depth, maturity, and serenity and that eventually brought him world renown with the publication of the English translations of Gitanjali in 1912.\nThe publication of Gitanjali was the most significant event in Tagore\u2019s writing career, for, following the volume\u2019s appearance, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913\u2014the first such recognition of an Eastern writer. And yet this slender volume of poems, which was \u201chailed by the literary public of England as the greatest literary event of the day\u201d and which created \u201cthe literary sensation of the day\u201d in America, according to the editors of the Literary History of the United States, reached English readers almost by chance. As Tagore explained in a letter to his niece Indira, he undertook the task of translating some of his poems into English during a March, 1912, illness that delayed his departure for England; he began his translations because he \u201csimply felt an urge to recapture through the medium of another language the feelings and sentiments which had created such a feast of joy within me in the days gone by.\u201d And once on board the ship in May 1912, he continued his translations to while away the time of travel.\nArriving in London in June 1912, he gave these translations to English painter William Rothenstein, who had visited India in 1910 and had shown interest in the poet\u2019s work. Deeply impressed, Rothenstein had copies typed and sent to poet William Butler Yeats, poet and critic Stopford Brooke, and critic Andrew Bradley\u2014all of whom enthusiastically received them. On June 30, Tagore gave a reading of his poems at Rothenstein\u2019s house to a distinguished group of fellow poets, including American poet Ezra Pound, who was at that time the foreign editor of Poetry, founded by Harriet Monroe. Pound wanted Poetry to be the first American magazine to print Tagore, and in a letter of December 24, 1912, he wrote to Harriet Monroe that Tagore\u2019s poems \u201care going to be THE sensation of the winter.\u201d In November 1912, the India Society of London published a limited edition of 750 copies of Gitanjali, with an introduction by Yeats and a pencil-sketch of the author by Rothenstein as frontispiece. In December 1912, Poetry included six poems from the book. And thus the Gitanjali poems reached both sides of the Atlantic to an ever-widening circle of appreciative readers.\nGitanjali was written shortly after the deaths of Tagore\u2019s wife, his two daughters, his youngest son, and his father. But as his son, Rathindranath, testified in On the Edges of Time, \u201che remained calm and his inward peace was not disturbed by any calamity however painful. Some superhuman sakti [force] gave him the power to resist and rise above misfortunes of the most painful nature.\u201d Gitanjali was his inner search for peace and a reaffirmation of his faith in his Jivan devata. Its central theme was the realization of the divine through self-purification and service to humanity. When presenting Tagore the Nobel Prize, Harold Hjarne noted, \u201cThe Gitanjali is Mysticism, but not a mysticism that, relinquishing personality, seeks to become absorbed in the All to a point of Nothingness, but one that, with all the faculties of soul at highest pitch, eagerly sets forth to meet the Living Father of all Creation.\u201d Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan said in The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore, \u201cThe poems of Gitanjali are the offerings of the finite to the infinite.\u201d In his introduction to Gitanjali, Yeats called it \u201cthe work of supreme culture\u201d and confessed, \u201cI have carried the manuscript of these translations about me for days, reading it in railway trains, or on top of omnibuses and in restaurants, and I have often had to close it lest some stranger would see how it moved me.\u201d Pound, in his Fortnightly Review essay, described Gitanjali as a \u201cseries of spiritual lyrics\u201d and compared it to \u201cthe Paradiso of Dante.\u201d Yeats and Pound set the tone of Tagore criticism in the West, and Gitanjali came to be looked upon as his most characteristic work.\nThe publication of Gitanjali was followed by five major poetical works in English translation: The Gardener (1913), The Crescent Moon (1913), Fruit-Gathering (1916), Lover\u2019s Gift and Crossing (1918), and The Fugitive and Other Poems (1919). The Gardener was a feast of love lyrics, though it also included mystical and religious poems, nature poems, and even a few poems with political overtones. The Crescent Moon, a book of songs about children, celebrated their beauty, innocence, charity, divinity, and primordial wisdom. Thompson called these poems a \u201crevelation of a child\u2019s mind, comparable to the best that any language had seen.\u201d The combined Lover\u2019s Gift and Crossing contained some of Tagore\u2019s best lyrics, and The Fugitive and Other Poems included \u201cUrvashi,\u201d Tagore\u2019s rapturous incantation of the Eternal Female, suggesting affinities with Shelley\u2019s \u201cHymn to Intellectual Beauty.\u201d In \u201cUrvashi,\u201d observed Thompson, there was \u201ca meeting of East and West indeed, a glorious tangle of Indian mythology, modern science, and legends of European romance.\u201d\nJ.C. Ghosh noted in Bengali Literature that \u201cthe more substantial and virile side of [Tagore\u2019s] work, such as his social, political, descriptive, and narrative poetry and his poetry of abstract thought, was either never presented at all or was presented in a terribly mutilated and emasculated form.\u201d Reviewing Tagore\u2019s literary reception in the West, Nabaneeta Sen in a Mahfil essay came to the conclusion that \u201cRabindranath only became a temporary craze, but never a serious literary figure in the Western scene. He was intrinsically an outsider to the contemporary literary tradition of the West, and after a short, misunderstood visit to the heart of the West, he again became an outsider.\u201d\nIn 1916 appeared Balaka (A Flight of Swans), which pointed to the new direction Tagore\u2019s poetry was to take. \u201cThe poems of Balaka,\u201d wrote Lago in Rabindranath Tagore, \u201creflect a time of account-taking and of Tagore\u2019s reactions to the turbulence of the past four years: the excitement surrounding the Nobel award and the knighthood that followed in 1915, the premonitions of political disaster, and the anxieties of the World War.\u201d The flying swans symbolized, for the poet, movement, restlessness, a longing for faraway sites, an eternal quest for the unknown. \u201cI am like a migratory bird having two homes\u2014and my home on the other side of the sea is calling me,\u201d he had written to William Rothenstein in 1915. Between 1916 and 1934, Tagore made five visits to America and traveled to nearly every country in Europe and Asia, delivering lectures, promoting his educational ideas, and stressing the need for a meeting of the East and the West. And wherever he went he was greeted as a living symbol of India\u2019s cultural and spiritual heritage.\nIn the last decade of his life, as he became conscious of his approaching death, Tagore turned to radical experimentation in poetic techniques and to purely humanistic concepts dealing with the problems of life and death. This new trend was reflected especially in his later Bengali poems collected in Punascha (1932; Postscript), Shesh Saptak (1935; Last Octave), Patraput (1935; Cupful of Leaves), Prantik (1938; The Borderland), Semjuti (1938; Evening Lamp), Nabajatak (1940; Newly Born), Rogashajyaya (1940; From the Sickbed), Arogya (1941; Recovery), and Sesh Lekha (1941; Last Writings). These poems \u201cbecame increasingly terse, luminous and precise in the use of imagery,\u201d wrote Amiya Chakravarty in A Tagore Reader. In The Later Poems of Tagore, Sisir Kumar Ghose said, \u201cFull of dramatic discords, through alternate rhythms of intensity and exhaustion, the[se] poems unfold the history of a conflict, long and carefully concealed, at the heart of the Rabindrean imagination.\u201d He concluded, \u201cTo accept the best among the later poems is to alter our total conception of Tagore\u2019s poetry.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cits hour is not yet. In order to do this as it should be done the ideal critic of Tagore needs to be as, if not more, sensitive than the poet himself. ... Such a critic we do not have, unless he is in hiding.\u201d\nTagore also published more than 40 plays, most of which were written for production in the open air for his students at Santiniketan. He himself took part in their performance as actor, producer, director, composer, and choreographer. He \u201cmocked the commercial Bengali theater, burdened with heavy sets and realistic decor, and created a lyrical theater of the imagination,\u201d wrote Balwant Gargi in his Folk Theater of India. Though Tagore was influenced by Western dramatic techniques and his plays, as Mohan Lal Sharma pointed out in a Modern Drama essay, \u201chave close affinity with the poetic or symbolist European drama of the present century typified in the works of such writers as Maurice Maeterlinck,\u201d he upheld the classical Indian tradition of drama as the depiction of emotion or rasa rather than of action. He blended this classical element with the folk tradition of Bengali Jatra performance\u2014a combination of group singing, dancing, and acting induced by a trance-like state\u2014to achieve a synthesis of music, poetry, dance, drama, and costume. Consequently, most of Tagore\u2019s plays are interspersed with songs and are either lyrical or symbolic with subtle emotional and metaphysical overtones. The main principle of his plays, as he said himself, was \u201cthe play of feeling and not of action.\u201d Judged by the standards of Western drama, therefore, they seem static, ill-constructed, and unsuitable for commercial production.\nTagore\u2019s experiments in dramatic forms extended from his earliest musical and verse dramas in the 1880s, through rollicking social comedies and symbolic plays in prose, to the highly imaginative and colorful dance dramas of the 1930s. Well known in the first category are Valmiki Pratibha (1881), Kal-Mrigaya (1882), Prakritir Pratisodh (1884; published in English as Sanyasi in 1917), Mayar Khela (1888), Raja O Rani (1889; The King and the Queen, 1917), Visarjan (1890; Sacrifice, 1917), Chitrangada (1892; published in English as Chitra in 1913), and Malini (1896; English translation, 1917). All of these, except Malini, are in blank verse, and most of them could be described in Tagore\u2019s own words as \u201ca series of dramatic situations ... strung on a thread of melody.\u201d The social comedies include Goday Galad (1892), Vaikunther Khata (1897), and Chirakumar Sabha (1926); and the notable symbolic plays in prose are Raja (1910; The King of the Dark Chamber, 1914), Dak-Ghar (1912; The Post Office, 1914), Phalguni (1916; The Cycle of Spring, 1917), Mukta-dhara (1922; The Waterfall, 1922), and Rakta-karavi (1924; Red Oleanders, 1925). Among the famous dance dramas are Chandalika (1933), Nrityanatya Chitrangada (1936), Chandalika Nrityanarya (1938), and Syama (1939).\nThematically, Prakritir Pratisodh \u2014which means \u201cnature\u2019s revenge\u201d and which was published in English under the title Sanyasi\u2014was Tagore\u2019s first important play. \u201cThis Nature\u2019s Revenge,\u201d he wrote in Reminiscences, \u201cmay be looked upon as an introduction to the whole of my future literary work; or, rather this has been the subject on which all my writings have dwelt\u2014the joy of attaining the Infinite within the finite.\u201d In his own words, \u201cthe hero was a Sanyasi (hermit) who had been striving to gain a victory over Nature by cutting away the bonds of all desires and affections and thus to arrive at a true and profound knowledge of self. A little girl, however, brought him back from his communion with the infinite to the world and into the bondage of human affection. On coming back the Sanyasi realised that the great is to be found in the small, the infinite within the bounds of form, and the eternal freedom of the soul in love. It is only in the light of love that all limits are merged in the limitless.\u201d Allegorically, the play represented the turning point in the poet\u2019s own life. \u201cThis was to put in a slightly different form,\u201d he confessed, \u201cthe story of my own experience, of the entrancing ray of light which found its way into the depths of the cave into which I had retired away from all touch of the outer world, and made me more fully one with Nature again.\u201d By 1884, the year of the play\u2019s first publication, Rabindranath had married his child-bride, Mrinalini Devi. He was then 22 and she only 10.\nOf these earliest plays, however, Visarjan (Sacrifice) is the best as a drama of conflict and ideas, as Chitrangada (Chitra) is the loveliest as poetry. Sacrifice is a powerful denunciation of violence, bigotry, and superstition. It expresses Tagore\u2019s abhorrence of the popular Bengali cult of Kali-worship involving animal sacrifice. The characters of the play, as Thompson observed, are \u201cswayed by the strong wind of their creator\u2019s emotions\u2014puppets in the grip of a fiercely felt idea.\u201d \u201cThe theme of Sacrifice,\u201d Thompson added, \u201chad been implicit in many an obscure page of Indian religious thought. But Rabindranath\u2019s play first gave its protest a reasoned and deliberate place in art.\u201d Chitra is a fascinating poetic play dealing with a romantic episode from the ancient Hindu epic, the Mahabharata: the love between Arjuna and Chitrangada, the beautiful daughter of Chitravahana, the king of Manipur. It seems to be modeled on Kalidasa\u2019s Shakuntala, a romantic play that probably dated from the fourth century B.C., and it presents the evolution of human love from the physical to the spiritual. Thompson called it \u201ca lyrical feast.\u201d Krishna R. Kripalani, Tagore\u2019s biographer, regarded it as \u201cone of Rabindranath\u2019s most beautiful plays, almost flawless as a work of art.\u201d \u201cThe simple and bald episode\u201d of the Mahabharata, he added, \u201cwas transformed by Rabindranath into a drama tense and vibrant with lyrical rapture and full of deep psychological insight.\u201d\nAmong Tagore\u2019s allegorical-philosophical-symbolic plays, Raja (The King of the Dark Chamber) is the most complex, written in the vein of Maeterlinck. The story is taken from a Buddhist Jataka, or story of reincarnation, but it undergoes a spiritual transformation in Tagore\u2019s hands. The symbolic significance of the play has attracted the attention of many critics. In An Introduction to Rabindranath Tagore, Vishwarath S. Naravane wrote: \u201cIn this play, Queen Sudarshana represents the finite soul which longs for a vision of the Infinite\u201d that is hidden in the dark, like \u201cthe true King, her real husband.\u201d Radhakrishnan, in The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore, gave the following interpretation of the play: \u201cAn individual cannot reach the ideal so long as fragments of finiteness stick to him, so long as intellect and will are bound to the realm of finite nature.\u201d As he explained in The Bengali Drama, P. Guha Thakurta regarded the theme of the play as the realization of truth through suffering and sorrow. Other critics have interpreted the play in terms of allegorical symbols: the real King is Truth or God or Life-Spirit; Queen Sudarshana is the individual soul; Suvama is Maya or illusion; Kanchi symbolizes the mind; and the maid Surangama represents self-surrender. Artistically, the play is a fine blending of the Jatra tradition and the classical form of Sanskrit drama.\nPerhaps the most popular and the most frequently performed among Tagore\u2019s plays is Dak-Ghar (The Post Office), which dramatizes the story of a lonely boy, Amal, confined to his sickroom, longing to be free. Day after day, he sits at the window, watching the colorful spectacle of life passing him by, until death brings him deliverance from earthly pain and confinement. The story presents Rabindranath\u2019s own childhood experience of bondage and loneliness in a house governed by \u201cservocracy.\u201d As he wrote to Andrews, \u201cI remember, at the time when I wrote it, my own feeling which inspired me to write it. Amal represents the man whose soul has received the call of the open road.\u201d\nThe play was produced in 1913 by the Abbey Theatre Company in Dublin and in London. Kripalani reported that after attending a performance of the play in London, William Butler Yeats testified: \u201cOn the stage the little play shows that it is very perfectly constructed, and conveys to the right audience an emotion of gentleness and peace.\u201d \u201cJudged by a London standard,\u201d wrote Ernest Rhys in Rabindranath Tagore: A Biographical Study, \u201cit may seem that all [Tagore\u2019s] dramatic work is lacking in ordinary stage effect, but to this criticism one can only reply that his plays were written to attain a naturalness of style and a simplicity of mode which only Irish players have so far realised for us.\u201d A reviewer for The Times called the play \u201cdreamy, symbolical, spiritual ... a curious play, leaving to a certain extent a sense of incompleteness, since it ends before the climax, rich in poetical thought and imagery, as well as a kind of symbolism that must not be pressed too closely.\u201d Since The Post Office can be read on two levels, the naturalistic and the symbolic, it has remained a special favorite with Tagore readers. In his book Rabindranath Tagore, Thompson paid the play a high compliment: \u201cThe Post Office does what both Shakespeare and Kalidas failed to do. It succeeds in bringing on the stage a child who neither shows off nor is silly.\u201d\nFollowing the public controversy that broke out between Mahatma Gandhi and Tagore in 1921 over the poet\u2019s opposition to Gandhi\u2019s noncooperation movement and his cult of the charkha (spinning wheel), Tagore\u2019s popularity suffered a steep decline and he found himself more and more publicly isolated. Gandhi, failing to enlist the poet\u2019s support, remarked: \u201cWell, if you can do nothing else for me you can at least ... lead the nation and spin.\u201d Tagore immediately replied: \u201cPoems I can spin, songs I can spin, but what a mess I would make, Gandhiji, of your precious cotton!\u201d There the controversy stopped. But the churnings in the poet\u2019s mind over the political situation in the country produced Mukta-dhara in January 1922, a symbolic play with political overtones. A distant echo of Prayaschitta (1909; Atonement), the play has been regarded by several critics as a noble tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and his campaign of nonviolence. Kripalani called the ascetic central character Dhananjaya, who teaches the people of Shivtarai to defy the authority of their unjust ruler through nonviolent civil resistance, a \u201cprototype of Mahatma Gandhi\u201d and wrote, \u201cPerhaps no other play of Tagore expresses his political convictions with such directness and vigour. ... His abhorrence of exploitation, whether by a foreign or a native tyrant, and his faith that tyranny can be effectively resisted by non-violence and evil redeemed by voluntary sacrifice.\u201d Tagore was making preparations to stage the play, but when he heard the news of Gandhi\u2019s arrest in March 1922, he abandoned the preparations and Mukta-dhara was never produced.\nLike Gandhi, Tagore preached against and fought the Indian caste system that fostered the concept of untouchability. The first number of Gandhi\u2019s weekly Harijan, issued in Poona on February 11, 1933, carried a poem by Tagore, \u201cThe Cleanser,\u201d on its front page. The same year, Tagore wrote Chandalika (The Untouchable Girl), a drama based on the Buddhist legend of Sardulakarnavadana. This is the story of a young untouchable girl, Prakriti, who falls in love with a handsome Buddhist monk, Ananda, when the latter asks her to give him some water to drink. As Ananda drinks water from her hands, she feels redeemed, spiritually reborn, newly aware of herself as a woman, and emancipated from the bondage of her birth and caste. No one could have paid a better tribute to Gandhi\u2019s cause of Harijan uplift than Tagore did in this poetic play. It remains a personal testament of Tagore the humanist, exemplifying his faith in the dignity of humanity.\nBetween 1883 and 1934 Tagore published 14 novels, several of which were translated into English during his lifetime: Ghare-Baire (1916; The Home and the World, 1919), Nauka Dubi (1906; The Wreck, 1921), and Gora (1910; published in English under same title, 1924). Others were translated after his death, including: Dui Bon (1933; Two Sisters, 1945), Sesher Kavita (1929; Farewell, My Friend, 1946), Malancha (1934; The Garden, 1956), and Nashtanir (1901; The Broken Nest, 1971). Most of these are fundamentally social novels, a few with strong political undercurrents. Among his translated novels, Chokher Bali (1903; Binodini, 1959), Gora, and The Home and the World are the best known in the Western world.\nWith Binodini, titled in the original Bengali Chokher Bali\u2014literally, \u201cEyesore\u201d\u2014Tagore \u201cpaved the way for the truly modern novel in India, whether realistic or psychological or concerned with social problems,\u201d wrote its English translator Krishna R. Kripalani in his foreword to the 1959 edition. The novel gives an intimate picture of domestic relations in an upper middle-class Bengali Hindu family at the turn of the century and portrays the plight of a young widow, Binodini, who \u201casserts her right to love and happiness.\u201d In Kripalani\u2019s view, \u201cOf all women characters created by Tagore in his many novels, Binodini is the most real, convincing, and full-blooded. In her frustrations and suffering is summed up the author\u2019s ironic acceptance of the orthodox Hindu society of the day.\u201d\nIn Gora Tagore created a socio-political novel voicing the aspirations of the resurgent India. Published in 1910, the year of the Gitanjali series of poems, it represented the peak of his fictional career. \u201cThis work,\u201d wrote Naravane in An Introduction to Rabindranath Tagore, \u201chas everything that one might expect from a masterpiece: brilliant delineation of characters; a story which offers surprises till the very end; a fluent, powerful style interspersed with bursts of poetic imagery, and absolute serenity.\u201d Though heavily filled with polemics reflecting the social, religious, and political issues of the time, the novel projected Tagore\u2019s concept of liberal nationalism based on the ideal of vishwa-bandhutva or international brotherhood. In a March 13, 1921, letter to Andrews, Tagore declared, \u201cAll humanity\u2019s greatest is mine. The infinite personality of man has come from the magnificent harmony of all races. My prayer is that India may represent the cooperation of all the people of the earth.\u201d In the extraordinary character and personality of the protagonist Gourmohan or Gora, Tagore tried to bring about the fusion of the East and the West to exemplify his ideal of the Universal Man. In Rabindranath Tagore, Lago declared Gora \u201ca study of the relation between Hindu orthodoxy and Indian nationalism.\u201d Gora\u2019s sudden discovery that he has no parents, no home, no country, no religion, brings him freedom from all barriers: \u201cBut today I am free\u2014yes, am standing freely in the center of a vast truth. Only now do I have the right to serve India. Today I have truly become an Indian. For me there is no conflict between Hindu, Muslim and Christian.\u201d\nThe subject of The Home and the World is the political agitation resulting from the partition of Bengal in 1905. Tagore was at the time deeply involved in the Indian National Movement. But when militant Hindu nationalism began to turn to violence and terrorist methods, he took a public stand against this development and openly condemned the excesses of the Swadeshi (swa, self; deshi, national) movement, which advocated the use of goods made in India. This position made him so unpopular with the nationalist Hindu intelligentsia that, in utter disillusionment, he withdrew from active politics and retreated into what he called the \u201cpoet\u2019s corner.\u201d But to answer his critics who had accused him of desertion and to reaffirm his own faith in the principles of truth and nonviolence, he wrote The Home and the World, which, as Bhabani Bhattacharya noted in an article that appeared in Rabindranath Tagore: A Centenary Volume, \u201croused a storm of controversy when it first appeared in serial form in the literary magazine Subui Patra and harsh pens assailed it not only as \u2018unpatriotic\u2019 but \u2018immoral.\u2019\u201d\nE.M. Forster, in a review that first appeared in Athenaeum and was later reprinted in Abinger Harvest, admired the novel\u2019s theme but was repelled by its persistent \u201cstrain of vulgarity.\u201d He wrote, \u201cthroughout the book one is puzzled by bad tastes that verge upon bad taste.\u201d He thought the novel contained much of \u201ca boarding-house flirtation that masks itself in mystic or patriotic talk.\u201d \u201cYet the plain fact is,\u201d as Bhattacharya pointed out, \u201cthat in matters of sex Tagore always retained in him a conservative core that was near-prudery, and his moments of realism in the context of such relationships were a whole epoch apart from the trends which our modern literary idiom calls \u2018naturalistic.\u2019\u201d\nRevolving around the three main characters\u2014Nikhil, an aristocrat with noble ideals; his beautiful wife, Bimla; and his intimate but unscrupulous friend Sandip\u2014the story is told in the first person singular by each one of these in the manner of Robert Browning\u2019s The Ring and the Book. Nikhil, the young protagonist, perhaps reflects Tagore\u2019s own feelings and predicament at seeing the nationalist hostility against him simply \u201cbecause I am not running amuck crying Bande Mataram.\u201d \u201cAlthough a poet\u2019s manifesto,\u201d wrote Kripalani, \u201cthe novel is equally a testament of Gandhi\u2019s philosophy of non-violence, of love and truth, of his insistent warning that evil means must vitiate the end, however nobly conceived.\u201d\nThough Tagore was the first modern Indian writer to introduce psychological realism in his fiction, his novels were generally looked upon as old-fashioned in form. As Aronson noted in Rabindranath through Western Eyes, \u201cAt a time when writers, like Aldous Huxley, James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, were experimenting with new forms of novel writing, at a time when the novel had reached its fullest maturity with the work of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky in Russia, with Marcel Proust and Andre Gide in France, Rabindranath could not but strike his European contemporaries as belonging both in style and characterisation to a different order of artistic expression, which they had passed long ago, somewhere in the first half of the nineteenth century.\u201d\nFrom the artistic point of view, however, Tagore excelled in the art of short story writing. As Bhattacharya wrote, \u201cThe short story was intrinsically suited to Tagore\u2019s temperament and it could carry the strongest echoes of his essentially poetic genius.\u201d Tagore himself wrote in a letter from the Tagore family estate headquarters at Shileidah: \u201cIf I do nothing but write short stories I am happy, and I make a few readers happy. The main cause of happiness is that the people about whom I write become my companions: they are with me when I am confined to my room in the rains. On a sunny day they move about me on the banks of the Padma.\u201d\nTagore wrote about 200 stories, the best of which appeared in English translation in four major collections during his lifetime: Broken Ties and Other Stories (1925), Mashi and Other Stories (1918), The Hungry Stones and Other Stories (1916), and The Glimpses of Bengal Life (1913). As a short story writer, Tagore was not only a pioneer in Bengali literature, but he also paved the way for modern writers like Premchand and such contemporary writers as Mulk Raj Anand, Raja Rao, and R.K. Narain. Bose acknowledged in An Acre of Green Grass that Rabindranath \u201cbrought us the short story when it was hardly known in England.\u201d Naravane wrote in An Introduction to Rabindranath Tagore, \u201cThe modern short story is Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s gift to Indian literature.\u201d\nA substantial amount of Tagore\u2019s writing was in the form of nonfictional prose\u2014essays and articles, religious and philosophical treatises, journals and memoirs, lectures and discourses, history and polemics, letters, and travel accounts. Of these, his philosophical writings\u2014Sadhana: The Realisation of Life (1913), Nationalism (1917), Personality (1917), Creative Unity (1922), The Religion of Man (1931), and Towards Universal Man (1961)\u2014were central to his thought. These writings were deeply influenced by the teachings of the Upanishads. In the preface to Sadhana, which was published in the Harvard lecture series, he confessed, \u201cThe writer has been brought up in a family where texts of the Upanishads are used in daily worship; and he has had before him the example of his father who lived his long life in the closest communion with God while not neglecting his duties to the world or allowing his keen interest in all human affairs to suffer any abatement.\u201d What appealed to Tagore the most in the teachings of the Upanishads was the concept of God as positive, personal, and realizable through love. He was also attracted to the Vaishnava ideal of love as the basis of man-God relationship. He believed that the love-drama between man and God was being enacted in the sensible world of color, sound, and touch. He was not only conscious of man\u2019s divinity but also of God\u2019s humanity. In Sonar Tari he wrote, \u201cWhatever I can offer to God I offer to man and to God I give whatever can I give to man. I make God man and man God.\u201d Such philosophical wisdom was reflected in many of his lyrics and dramas.\nTagore dictated his last poem a few hours before his death on August 7, 1941. The leading newspapers of the world published editorials paying tribute to him as \u201cIndia\u2019s greatest man of letters,\u201d \u201cthe soul of Bengal,\u201d and \u201cambassador of friendship between East and West.\u201d But the Washington Post provided perhaps the most telling of assessments: \u201cTagore believed that East and West do not represent antagonistic and irreconcilable attitudes of the human mind, but that they are complementary, and since Tagore\u2019s own work and thought represented a fusion of East and West, the fate of his poems and dramas at the hands of later generations ... may be the test of whether the age-old gulf between Asia and Europe can ever be bridged.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Asia, South"]}}
