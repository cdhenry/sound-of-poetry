She earned an MFA at the University of Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop and an MA at the University of Bristol. She is the author of the poetry collections A Woman of Property\u00a0(2016),\u00a0Revolver (2008), a finalist for the PEN Award, and Worth (2002). Her work has been featured in several anthologies, including Women Poets on Mentorship: Efforts and Affections (2007) and Legitimate Dangers: American Poets of the New Century (2006).\r\n\u00a0\r\nPoet and critic Stephen Burt has described Schiff\u2019s poems as \u201cwell made and uncommonly elaborate.\u201d Her work frequently treats objects and historical figures in virtuosic lyric detail. In an interview with the Poetry Society of America, Schiff stated, \u201cmore so than a specific practice in one of the other arts, curation as an art form in itself has most informed me. Of course at museums I\u2019m moved by so many individual works\u2014but it\u2019s the crosstalk between seemingly disparate objects that really inspires me.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nSchiff\u2019s honors include an award from the Academy of American Poets Greenwall Fund and inclusion in the Poetry Society of America\u2019s 2007 Festival of New American Poets. Coeditor of Canarium Books and the literary journal The Canary,\u00a0Schiff is a professor at the University of Iowa and lives with her husband, poet and filmmaker\u00a0Nick Twemlow, in Iowa City.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
