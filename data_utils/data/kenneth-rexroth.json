He led a tumultuous life that included being orphaned at 14, constant traveling both in the US and abroad, intense political activism, and four marriages. He was largely self-educated and fluent in a number of languages; his work addressed and incorporated Eastern and Western philosophy, ecology, sexuality, and mysticism. Rexroth was influential to a number of midcentury American poets associated with the San Francisco Renaissance and was known, in his lifetime, as \u201cGodfather\u201d of the Beats\u2014he organized and emceed the Six Gallery reading in 1955 where Allen Ginsberg first read \u201cHowl.\u201d Rexroth\u2019s political activity was also notable: he was a conscientious objector during World War II and helped Japanese Americans evade internment policies enacted by the US government. Later in life, he also supported the Civil Rights, anti-war, and feminist movements. He taught at the University of California, Santa Barbara throughout the late 1960s and early \u201870s and went to Japan on a Fulbright fellowship in 1974. He was recognized later in life by the literary establishment he had spent decades railing against: he received the Copernicus Award from the Academy of American Poets in 1975 and a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship in 1977. Rexroth died in 1982.\nIn a reminiscence written for the Los Angeles Times Book Review, Kenneth Rexroth\u2019s friend and former student Thomas Sanchez portrayed him as a \u201clongtime iconoclast, onetime radical, Roman Catholic, Communist fellow traveler, jazz scholar, I.W.W. anarchist, translator, philosopher, playwright, librettist, orientalist, critical essayist, radio personality, newspaper columnist, painter, poet and longtime Buddhist.\u201d Rexroth also made major contributions to modern American poetry. The length and breadth of his career resulted in a body of work that not only chronicles his personal search for visionary transcendence but also reflects the artistic, cultural, and political vicissitudes of more than half a century. In a 1967 New York Times Book Review John Unterecker commented that \u201creading through all of Kenneth Rexroth\u2019s shorter poems is a little like immersing oneself in the literary history of the last 40 years; for Rexroth experimented with almost all of the poetic techniques of the time, dealt, at least in passing, with all of its favorite themes.\u201d\n\r\nA prolific painter and poet by age 17, Rexroth traveled through a succession of avant-garde and modernist artistic movements, gaining a reputation as a radical by associating with labor groups and anarchist political communities. He experimented amid Chicago\u2019s \u201csecond renaissance\u201d in the early 1920s, explored modernist techniques derived from the European-born \u201crevolution of the word,\u201d played an integral part in the anarchist-pacifist politics and poetic mysticism that pervaded San Francisco\u2019s Bay Area in the 1940s, and affiliated himself with the \u201cBeat Generation\u201d in the mid-1950s. Intellectually as well as artistically eclectic, Rexroth scorned institutionalized education and criticism, calling American academics \u201ccorn belt Metaphysicals and country gentlemen,\u201d as M.L. Rosenthal noted in The Modern Poets. After quitting school in his early teens, the poet pursued a curriculum of self-education that included not only literature from diverse cultures and times but encompassed science, philosophy, theology, anthropology, Asian thought and culture, and half a dozen languages. William R. McKaye of the Washington Post emphasized: \u201cIn an era in which American colleges crank out graduates who seemingly have never read anything, Rexroth \u2026 [appeared] well on the way to having read everything. And \u2018everything\u2019 is not just the standard European classics in translation: it is the Latins and Greeks in the original; it is the Japanese and Chinese; it is poetry of all kinds; \u2026 curiosities as the literature of alchemy, the writings of 18th and 19th century Anglican divines and the \u2018Religio Medici\u2019 of Sir Thomas Browne.\u201d\n\nJames Laughlin, founder of the New Directions Publishing Corporation which published and kept in print most of Rexroth\u2019s books, agreed that the poet found his mature style in The Phoenix and the Tortoise (1944) and The Signature of All Things (1950). \u201cWhen he hit his true vein, a poetry of nature mixed with contemplation and philosophy, it was magnificent,\u201d Laughlin claimed in a tribute. The Phoenix and the Tortoise was called by Morgan Gibson in his book Kenneth Rexroth, \u201cmuch more coherent in style and theme\u201d than Rexroth\u2019s earlier work while focusing less on experimentation and politics. Instead, the book initiated a study of \u201cthe \u2018integral person\u2019 who, through love, discovers his responsibility for all in a world of war, cold war, and nuclear terror.\u201d The true achievement of The Phoenix and the Tortoise and Rexroth\u2019s next book, The Signature of All Things, was the emergence of \u201cpoems that affirm more convincingly than ever the transcendent power of personal love,\u201d Gibson stated. \u201cRead The Signature of All Things,\u201d Laughlin urged. \u201cIt, how shall I put it, pulls everything in human life together. It is all there, all the things we cherish, all our aspirations, and over it all a kind of Buddhist calm.\u201d Reviewing The Signature of All Things in the New York Times, Richard Eberhart outlined both Rexroth\u2019s intent and his accomplishment: \u201cMr. Rexroth\u2019s purpose is to make a particular kind of poem which will be classical in its restraint, but without severity; personal, revealing, and confessional, without being sentimental; and it must, according to his bent, eschew symbolism and any kind of ambiguous imagery for a narrative or statement strength based on noun and verb, but not weakened by adjectives.\u201d\n\r\nThe form Rexroth adopted in his mature work, which he called \u201cnatural numbers,\u201d was unrhymed and syllabic rather than metrically regular. Generally varying from seven to nine syllables per line, the structure allowed him to emphasize the \u201cnatural cadences of speech,\u201d which Gibson pointed out had been important to the poet from the days of his earliest Cubist experiments. Looking back to the 1950s, Karl Malkoff remarked in a 1970 Southern Review: \u201cRexroth \u2026 never stopped experimenting with rhythms, which not surprisingly are crucial to the success of his poems. Here his work is most vulnerable; here his successes, when they come, are most striking. When \u2026 Rexroth hit upon the seven syllable line as a temporary resolution, he was accused of writing prose broken up into lines. \u2026 Actually, on rereading, Rexroth\u2019s ear proves reasonably reliable.\u201d When he published his first collection of selected work, the poet entitled it Natural Numbers: New and Selected Poems (1963), thus reaffirming the importance of an element critics had dismissed earlier as ineffective or unimportant.\n\r\nRexroth\u2019s tetralogy of verse plays in \u201cnatural numbers,\u201d Beyond the Mountains (1951), proves not only his devotion to the natural patterns of speech but indicates his knowledge of classical Greek and Asian literature. Gibson claimed in his study that the author\u2019s \u201cpoetic, philosophical, and visionary powers [reached] their epitome\u201d in the four dramas \u201cPhaedra,\u201d \u201cIphigenia at Aulis,\u201d \u201cHermaios,\u201d and \u201cBerenike.\u201d While the characters were based in Greek tragedy, Rexroth\u2019s style reflected Japanese Noh drama. As Gibson related, an \u201cimportant quality of Noh found in Rexroth\u2019s plays is yugen, a term derived from Zen Buddhism and defined by Arthur Waley as \u2018what lies beneath the surface\u2019; the subtle, as opposed to the obvious; the hint, as opposed to the statement.\u201d Although several commentators felt Beyond the Mountains suffered from obscurity or was more complex than necessary\u2014including R.W. Flint, who wrote in Poetry magazine that the \u201cplotting has been just a shade too ambitious for [Rexroth\u2019s] poetic gift\u201d\u2014the renowned poet William Carlos Williams applauded both the work\u2019s language and its form. \u201cRexroth is one of the leading craftsmen of the day,\u201d proclaimed Williams in the New York Times. \u201cThere is in him no compromise with the decayed line of past experience. His work is cleanly straightforward. The reek of polluted Shakespeare just isn\u2019t in it, or him. I don\u2019t know any Greek, but I can imagine that a Greek, if he knew our language as we ought to but don\u2019t, would like the athletic freshness of the words.\u201d\n\r\nA common concern for poetry as straightforward, spoken language was only one of the links between Rexroth and the Beat Generation. Quoting Jack Kerouac\u2019s definition found in Random House Dictionary, Charters defined the term Beat Generation as \u201c\u2018members of the generation that came of age after World War II who, supposedly as a result of disillusionment stemming from the Cold War, [espoused] mystical detachment and relaxation of social and sexual tension.\u2019 Emerging at a time of great postwar change, the Beat Generation was more than a literary movement, but at its heart was its literature.\u201d Charters and Miller explained how Rexroth came to be connected with the movement: \u201cBy the mid-1950s many of the poets who were to become famous as Beat writers\u2014Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Michael McClure, Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen\u2014had moved to San Francisco, attracted by the climate of radical poetry and politics, and they were soon part of Rexroth\u2019s circle. \u2026 Considering the diverse aspects of Rexroth\u2019s interests in avant-garde art, radical politics, and Eastern philosophy, one can understand why he seemed the perfect mentor for the Beats.\u201d\n\r\nRexroth occupied a central position in the Bay Area\u2019s literary community at the time. Characterized as \u201canarchopacifist in politics, mystical-personalist in religions, and experimental in esthetic theory and practice\u201d by Gibson, the community revolved around the Pacifica Foundation, with its public arts radio station, and the Poetry Center at San Francisco State College, both of which Rexroth helped establish. As a contributor to the Nation, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the New York Times, he also wielded a certain critical power across the country. Rexroth used these forums to champion the younger poets\u2019 work in articles like his February, 1957, Nation review entitled \u201cSan Francisco\u2019s Mature Bohemians.\u201d Most instrumental in linking Rexroth with the Beats, however, may have been the frequent poetry readings\u2014often to jazz accompaniment\u2014that Rexroth attended or helped organize from 1955 to 1957.\n\r\nRexroth considered the readings essential to foment \u201cpoetry as voice, not as printing,\u201d as he told readers in his American Poetry: In the Twentieth Century (1971). Supporting the Beats with reviews and with his presence at their events, including his series of readings at the Cellar jazz club, Rexroth earned the title \u201cGodfather of the Beats.\u201d \u201cKenneth Rexroth seemed to appear everywhere at their side like the shade of Virgil guiding Dante through the underworld,\u201d Alfred Kazin wrote in Contemporaries. \u201cRexroth \u2026 suddenly became a public figure.\u201d\n\r\nUndoubtedly influencing the Beats more than they influenced him, the poet nonetheless was considered part of the school he instructed by many conservative or academic critics. As such, he often was dismissed or opposed as being part of a nonconformist craze. Some reviewers looked beyond the image, however, to assess the poet\u2019s work itself. \u201cRexroth\u2019s In Defense of the Earth [1956] showed him the strongest of West Coast anarchist poets because he is a good deal more than a West Coast anarchist poet,\u201d emphasized Rosenthal. \u201cHe is a man of wide cultivation and, when not too busy shocking the bourgeois reader (who would like nothing better), a genuine poet.\u201d Added Gibson: \u201cRexroth\u2019s book of the Beat period, In Defense of the Earth \u2026 is no period piece. \u2026 These poems of love and protest, of meditation and remembrance, stand out as some of his most deeply felt poems.\u201d\n\r\nDespite the vehement support Rexroth expressed for the birth of the Beat Generation, he became disillusioned when he saw the movement\u2019s more prominent members become \u201chipsters.\u201d Miller and Charters state that the poet \u201cseemed to have become jealous of [the Beats\u2019] success and widespread attention from the national press. He had fought for many years for his own recognition as a Poet,\u201d they pointed out, \u201cand as [the Beats\u2019] popularity increased, his growing hostility toward [them] was expressed in a series of articles over the next several years.\u201d Nevertheless, Rexroth remained supportive of certain aspects of some Beat writers\u2019 works while condemning the movement as a whole. Several critics now note this point, attributing both Rexroth\u2019s animosities and his preferences to an individual integrity not influenced by blind allegiance\u2014or enmity\u2014to any literary collective.\n\r\nRexroth\u2019s position as a central yet independent figure in American literature was further strengthened by a personal account of his youth, entitled An Autobiographical Novel (1966). According to Dean Stewart, writing in the Los Angeles Times Book Review, the work \u201cdid most to enhance [Rexroth\u2019s] image as a living historical personality; his essays in book form and spreading reputation as a keen social critic and insightful philosopher also helped.\u201d Yet, while his role as the \u201coutsider\u2019s insider\u201d in the literary world became widely acknowledged, serious attention to his own poetry seemed to receive secondary consideration. Commented Stewart: \u201cFor a poet who has constantly said he \u2018only writes prose for money,\u2019 Rexroth rivals H. L. Mencken as a terse and cogent critic. But like Mencken, the largely forgotten lexicographer, little-read essayist and much remembered personality, Rexroth may share a similar descending fame from poet to translator to essayist to personality.\u201d\n\r\nGibson emphasized that in order to appreciate the importance of what Rexroth presents in An Autobiographical Novel the reader must understand Rexroth\u2019s world view as it evolves through all his works. Integral to the development of the poet\u2019s vision were his translation of foreign verse (both contemporary and ancient) and his study of Asian thought. Rexroth felt an artistic kinship with the Greeks and Romans of classical times and with Japanese and Chinese writers. Although, as Gibson commented, literary critics have yet to explore the relationships between Rexroth\u2019s translations and his own poetry, it has been generally recognized that his later poems are characterized by a serenity and quiet intensity that reflect his study of Asian art and philosophy.\n\nThe Heart\u2019s Garden, the Garden\u2019s Heart (1968), New Poems (1974), and The Morning Star (1979)\u2014Rexroth\u2019s major poetry collections published after his autobiography\u2014illustrate both his involvement with Asian cultures and his final resolutions of philosophical and technical concerns. Rexroth was, stated Victor Howes in the Christian Science Monitor, looking \u201cfor a sort of day-to-day mysticism.\u201d It was \u201ca poetry of direct statement and simple clear ideas,\u201d the critic continued. \u201cA poetry free of superfluous rhetoric. One might call it a poetry of moments.\u201d Agreed Richard Eberhart in Nation, \u201cRexroth \u2026 settled down to the universal validity of stating simple and deep truths in a natural way.\u201d \u201cThough he [had] always been a visionary, he spent more than three decades searching for a philosophical rationale for his experience, for history, and for nature. In the 1960s he seems to have abandoned that kind of quest in favor of pure visionary experience,\u201d Gibson summarized. \u201c[The Heart\u2019s Garden, the Garden\u2019s Heart], an extended Buddhist-Taoist meditation written in Japan, shows the depths of his resignation and enlightenment.\u201d\n\r\nWritten as Rexroth celebrated his 60th birthday, The Heart\u2019s Garden, the Garden\u2019s Heart did not \u201caim at giving answers to final questions that have none,\u201d explained Luis Ellicott Yglesias in the New Boston Review. \u201cInstead it is a meditation on a handful of central images that have been treasured for centuries because they have the virtue of clarifying experience to the points of making it possible to relinquish life with the facility of a ripe apple dropping from its branch.\u201d Woodcock, who recognized in Rexroth\u2019s earlier works a dialogue between the poet\u2019s \u201cconceptualizing mind\u201d and his \u201cexperiencing sensibility,\u201d felt the two were reconciled in the volume. Out of the fusion \u201cthere appears a unique contemplative intensity,\u201d the critic stated in New Leader. \u201cWhat has been forged is a supercharged imagism in which every physical object, every scene, every picture the poet creates, is loaded with burdens of meaning that cannot otherwise be expressed.\u201d This reconciliation of the immediate and the enduring continued in New Poems, which Herbert Leibowitz said were composed \u201cof a flash or revelatory image and silent metamorphoses.\u201d Describing what he saw as Rexroth\u2019s achievement, Leibowitz continued in the New York Times Book Review: \u201cSyntax is cleared of the clutter of subordinate clauses, that contingent grammar of a mind hesitating, debating with itself, raging against death and old age. The dynamics of his poems are marked piano\u2014even storms are luminous rather than noisy.\u201d The quietness, as well as a vital eroticism, carried over to Rexroth\u2019s volume of verse The Morning Star. Containing three previously published collections, including the sequence that Rexroth pretended was translated from the Japanese (The Love Songs of Marichiko), the book offers a \u201cdirectness and clarity\u201d not usually associated with Western art, according to David Kirby in the Times Literary Supplement. \u201cHow different this is from the Rexroth of The Phoenix and the Tortoise (1944), who sounds like Lawrence and Pound and Whitman, or the one who wrote [Thou Shalt Not Kill] in In Defense of the Earth. \u2026 Now he appears to belong, or to want to belong, at least as much as a publishing writer can, to the Buddhist bodhisattvas [or other Eastern religions].\u201d\n\nKenneth Rexroth and James Laughlin: Selected Letters offers letters exchanged between 1937 and 1982 between Rexroth and James Laughlin, the founder of the New Directions publishing house. The letters reveal the friendship between the men as well as their ongoing professional relationship; Laughlin published most of Rexroth\u2019s important poetry collections, while Rexroth in turn led a number of influential writers to Laughlin and New Directions. \u201cRexroth is often preoccupied with his own financial need in his letters to Laughlin. Most often his tone is accusatory,\u201d noted John Tritica in Western American Literature. Indeed, Rexroth often castigated Laughlin for not supporting him sufficiently or for not publishing authors that he thought deserved to be published. \u201cMore than anything, the letters testify to the forbearance and patience of James Laughlin as a friend,\u201d remarked Gerald Nicosia in the Los Angeles Times Book Review.\n\r\n\u201cRevolutionary and conservative, worldly and spiritual, Asian and western ideas from traditions that may seem irreconcilable were uniquely harmonized in Rexroth\u2019s world view as expressed [throughout] his philosophical poetry and essays,\u201d Gibson wrote in his study Kenneth Rexroth. Concluded Douglas Dunn in Listener: \u201cInsufficient credit has been granted to Rexroth\u2019s identity as an old-fashioned, honest-to-God man of letters of downright independence of mind. \u2026 His temper [was] too independent, too scholarly, for cut-and-dried allegiances. He [turned] his back on Eliot and Pound. He [had] the irritating habit\u2014for the mediocre, that is, the literary side-takers\u2014of liking some but not all of certain poets or movements. Like all good examples in modern poetry, he has been seen as a figure instead of as a creator; as a representative rather than as a participant. That he is all four of these persons at once comes as a sweet discovery from a reading of his work instead of from side-glances at other people\u2019s estimates of his reputation.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"], "School/Period:": ["Beat"]}}
