After teaching in China for a year, she moved to Brooklyn, New York, where she teaches and edits for Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs, a publisher of poetry. Iijima\u2019s collections of poetry include Around Sea (2004), Animate, Inanimate Aims (2007), Subsistence Equipment (2008), Revv. You\u2019ll\u2014ution (2009), and If Not Metamorphic (2010).  In her work, Iijima addresses the subjects of science, gender, ecology, and history. Alan Davies, reviewing Around Sea, noted that in her poems, \u201cmeaning accrues by dint of repeated hint.\u201d If Not Metamorphic is rich in the language and metaphorical implications of geology, and is often driven by sound associations. A Publishers Weekly reviewer noted that the title poem, \u201ccomposed entirely of questions, sifts and settles across its pages like sediment.\u201d  Iijima is the editor of eco language reader (2010), a collection of essays by poets on matters of ecological concern. \n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
