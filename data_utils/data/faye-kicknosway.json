She earned a BA at Wayne State University and an MA at San Francisco State College.\r\n\u00a0\r\nKicknosway is the author of more than a dozen poetry collections, including Mixed Plate: New and Selected Poems (2003), Who Shall Know Them? (1985), and All These Voices: New and Selected Poems (1986). Her work is also featured in the feminist poetry anthology No More Masks! (1973).\r\n\u00a0\r\nThreading together psychological narrative with mythic violence, Kicknosway\u2019s poems reveal a filmic attention to the transformative possibilities of light and shadow. In a review of All These Voices, poet Jason Schneiderman observes, \u201cKicknosway challenges the dominance and trustworthiness of narrative in her poems of fragmentation, offering up constant revisions of where the gaze should fall.\u201d Who Shall Know Them?, her book of poems engaging Walker Evans\u2019s photographs, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.\r\n\u00a0\r\nKicknosway\u2019s other honors include a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts and a PEN Syndicated Fiction Award. She lives in Honolulu, where she has taught at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa\u00a0under the name Morgan Blair.\r\n\ufeff\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western", "Pacific Islands"]}}
