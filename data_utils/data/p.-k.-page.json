Page is also known as P.K. Irwin, the acclaimed painter, and as Judith Cape, the fiction writer. Her many poetry collections include Planet Earth: Poems Selected and New (2002), Evening Dance of the Grey Flies (1981), Cry Ararat! Poems New and Selected (1967), The Metal and the Flower (1954), and As Ten As Twenty (1946). She was given the Governor General\u2019s award for her second book, The Metal and the Flower, and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1977. In a Canadian Literature review, A.J.M. Smith places Page \u201camong the fine poets of this century\u201d and deems her poem \u201cArras\u201d \u201cthe high point of a school of Canadian symbolist poets.\u201d Critics find a unity of vision in all her works. \u201cPage is an almost entirely visual poet,\u201d writes Canadian Literature essayist Rosemary Sullivan, who believes that Page\u2019s line \u201cI suffer shame in all these images\u201d conveys \u201cone of the deepest impulses of her work.\u201d Page also reaches out for a reality beyond the visible world. \u201cLandscapes behind the eyes have appeared in Page\u2019s poems since her first collection in 1946. [In Evening Dance of the Grey Flies] they shine in the jewelled colouring of her intricately-wrought technique, a technique which has always been dazzling,\u201d Ann Mandel notes in a Canadian Forum review. Sullivan observes, \u201cThe discrepancy between the ideal world of the imagination, the potent world of dream, and the real world of the senses becomes one of her most obsessive subjects.\u201d\n\r\nSullivan reports that Page \u201cbegan her poetic career with a reputation as a poet of social commitment and is probably still best known for the poems of the 1940s written while she was a member of the Montreal Preview group of poets.\u201d During that time, Montreal was the center of Canadian literary activity. The group, which included Page, Patrick Anderson, F.R. Scott, and many other poets, produced Preview, the literary magazine in which Page\u2019s earliest poems first appeared. According to Canadian Literature contributor S. Namjoshi, this group \u201chad leftist leanings, and several of [Page\u2019s] poems reveal what may be termed a \u2018pro-proletarian\u2019 consciousness.\u201d However, Sullivan maintains that Page\u2019s \u201cpoetry has more to do with folklore, myth and archetype than with objective time, history and social fact.\u201d While the critic finds a \u201cgenuine compassion\u201d for society\u2019s victims in Page\u2019s early poetry, Sullivan notes that \u201cthe poet\u2019s verbal facility betrays her. The attention she gives to metaphor distracts from the human dilemma that is her theme.\u201d\nPoet and critic A.J.M. Smith reports in Canadian Literature that Page\u2019s experiences during the Fifties and early Sixties stimulated her attention to detail. During those years, she accompanied her husband, a Canadian editor and diplomat, to Australia, Brazil, and Mexico. Though Page painted more than she published during this time, Smith believes \u201cher painting and her poetry complemented one another: each \u2026 made the other better, or made it more deeply what it was. \u2026 And then the immersion in the language, landscape, and the mythology of the strange, intense, and perhaps intensely unCanadian places had a stimulating and enriching influence on all her latest poems.\u201d Negative criticism of Page\u2019s poetry centers on the abundance of vivid images. \u201cEach of Miss Page\u2019s stanzas is so crowded with new and exciting pictures, that \u2026 [each] seems \u2026 to require the attention of a whole poem,\u201d John Sutherland comments in the Northern Review. As Sullivan explains, Page \u201chas such a remarkable verbal gift that the image-making process can become almost too seductive. \u2026 The poet is trapped by her remarkable responsiveness to nature.\u201d Page is so receptive to \u201csensual detail, to each \u2018bright glimpse of beauty,\u2019 that even the sense of self, of separateness from the world, seems threatened.\u201d\nThis threat is a major element in her novel and first book. The heroine in The Sun and the Moon (1944) empathizes so thoroughly with inanimate objects that she \u201cbecomes a rock, a chair, a tree, experiencing these forms of existence in moments of identity,\u201d Sullivan relates. \u201cBut there is an alternative rhythm where the self is invaded. \u2026 Not only her identity, but also the identity of the other is destroyed by her chameleon presence. \u2026 To control this invasion an extraordinary exertion of will is necessary. For the poet, this means a control through technique, verbal dexterity. But P.K. Page\u2019s greatest dilemma is to ensure that this control is not sterile, that language is explored as experience, not evasion.\u201d\nPage\u2019s writings also discuss the danger of becoming trapped in the private world of the imagination. Namjoshi defines the \u201ccentral persona\u201d of Page\u2019s poetry as \u201cthe woman caught within the confines of her inner reality, her personal Noah\u2019s Ark, seeking some way to reconcile the internal and the external, to make a harmony out of the double landscapes.\u201d \u201cThat the artist must make the effort to mediate between the internal and the external is central to her poetry,\u201d the reviewer states. Namjoshi names the poem \u201cCry Ararat\u201d Page\u2019s \u201cmost successful effort at bringing the private world and the external world into alignment. \u2018Ararat!\u2019 is the cry of the isolated individual trapped within the confines of his private ark.\u201d Mount Ararat symbolizes a resting place between the \u201cflood\u201d of detail in the physical world, and \u201cthe stifling closeness of his own four walls. He need not withdraw into his private world, nor is his individuality submerged in the flood.\u201d This poem lends its title to Page\u2019s third book of poems, Cry Ararat!: Poems New and Selected (1967)\u2014a loan that Namjoshi deems \u201cfitting,\u201d since the poem \u201cis a definitive and serious investigation of [Page\u2019s] theme, and brings the dilemma postulated by her to a final resolution.\u201d\nIn Evening Dance of the Grey Flies (1981), the poet\u2019s seventh book, Times Literary Supplement contributor Fleur Adcock recognizes the characteristic \u201cspiritual quest which expresses itself in highly colorful visionary language.\u201d Kevin Lewis, writing in Quill and Quire, says of Page, \u201cIt is no small feat to write convincing poetry in such a thick, imagistic style. \u2026 She must stand as one of the premier poets in Canada simply because she has such a beautiful way with words.\u201d Canadian Literature contributor Tom Marshall concludes, \u201cAs poet and calligrapher, [Page] delights in details and images, but has learned \u2026 to subordinate whimsy to the \u2026 design or large metaphor that captures a sense of the macrocosm. \u2026 She is one of our best poets.\u201d\nBrazilian Journal (1987) covers Page\u2019s stay in Brazil from 1957 to 1959. George Woodcock in Dictionary of Literary Biography calls it \u201cboth a remarkable travel book and a vivid work of autobiography.\u201d During this period of her life, Page suffered from writer\u2019s block in regards to her poetry. As she tended to keep her most personal experiences out of her writing, only subtle references to her difficulties are included in this work. Despite this, Ruby Andrew notes in Quill and Quire, Brazilian Journal \u201coffers a tantalizing portrait of the artist.\u201d During this time, Page fell in love with the people and her surroundings in Brazil and found her creative outlet in painting. She published Brazilian Journal, which includes both prose and sketches, at the behest of her friend, the Canadian writer Michael Ondaatje.\nReviews of the work are somewhat mixed. Andrew lauds Page\u2019s ability to fuse her visual talents with the written word, praising Page\u2019s \u201cgraceful, painterly passages [which] are leavened with delightful minutiae.\u201d Despite the Brazilian Journal\u2019s structure as a diary, George Galt, writing for Saturday Night, finds it is \u201cbest judged as a travelogue; and as a travel writer Page shines.\u201d John Bemrose, writing for Maclean\u2019s, praises Page\u2019s verbal mastery, noting her \u201cpoet\u2019s gift for meticulous observation and inventive metaphor,\u201d but also remarks that the book falls short in terms of shedding more light on Page herself. \u201cIn the absence of any narrative control or intellectual overview, all the description finally weighs on the reader like too much party chatter.\u201d\nPage began exploring writing for children with the fairy tales A Flask of Sea Water (1988) and The Traveling Musicians (1989). A Flask of Sea Water is the story of a goatherd who falls in love with a princess after seeing her for the first time. He competes with two other suitors for her hand in marriage; the first of the competitors to bring back a flask of sea water is declared the winner. Several critics lauded the book. In Canadian CL, Cynthia Messenger calls A Flask of Sea Water \u201ca delightful fairy tale,\u201d concluding that \u201cGiven her apparent ease with the form, one can only regret that Page did not start writing fairy tales sooner.\u201d The reviewer for The Horn Book Magazine finds that \u201cWhile Page breaks no new ground \u2026 she exhibits a great facility for combining the well-known, standard elements of the traditional fairy tale \u2026 into an original fairy tale that will entrance children.\u201d Sarah Ellis, also writing for The Horn Book Magazine, finds the tale to have \u201ca higher degree of psychological realism than in the traditional fairy tale. \u2026 But while Page extends the fairy tale conventions, we never sense parody or weariness or anything but respect for the form.\u201d Anne Gilmore in Quill and Quire lauds A Flask of Sea Water as a \u201cwonderful addition to the genre.\u201d\nThe Traveling Musicians is an adaptation of the classic The Musicians of Bremen by the brothers Grimm. Although the work was originally adapted as a narration for the Victoria Symphony Orchestra of Canada in 1983, Page chose to publish the tale by itself in 1989. Her modernization of the tale using contemporary colloquial speech and elements of everyday life enhances the classic story, and reviewers reacted positively to Page\u2019s rendering. Ralph Lavender in School Librarian praises The Traveling Musicians as \u201cfresh\u201d and notes that the tale \u201creads aloud superlatively well.\u201d Sheila O\u2019Hearn in Canadian Children\u2019s Literature concludes, \u201cP.K. Page\u2019s version is to be lauded for its originality of expression and its ability to engage youngsters so thoroughly.\u201d\nAn active writer and artist until the end of her life, Page died in 2010 in Oak Bay, British Columbia.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Canada"]}}
