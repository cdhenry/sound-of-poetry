Early in her writing career she took a workshop with Ed Hirsch, whose encouragement motivated her to pursue writing further. She earned an MFA at the University of Houston and a PhD at the University of Missouri.  Curdy co-edited, with Lynne McMahon, The Longman Anthology of Poetry (2006)\u2014a painstaking task during which she found that \u201cElizabeth Bishop and Emily Dickinson seem to be the only poets on whom everyone agrees.\u201d  She has won the Rona Jaffe Foundation Writing Award, a Pushcart Prize, and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Illinois Council for the Arts. She has also won a Lannan Writing Residency Fellowship. Her poems have appeared in many journals, including Poetry, The Paris Review, The Kenyon Review, and The New England Review.  She lives in Chicago and teaches at Northwestern University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
