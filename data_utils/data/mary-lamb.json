She suffered from bipolar disorder and, during an episode in 1796, killed her mother with a kitchen knife. Her younger brother Charles, a poet and essayist who worked for the East India Company, agreed to serve as Mary\u2019s caretaker rather than consign her to lifelong institutionalization. They lived together for nearly 40 years, save for Mary\u2019s annual manic episodes, during which she was institutionalized.\nDespite her illness, the siblings developed a collaborative writing relationship and produced many well-known collections of poetry and prose for children, including Tales from Shakespeare (1807), Mrs. Leicester\u2019s School (1809), and Poetry for Children (1809). The books they wrote together were published anonymously or under Charles\u2019s name in order to shield Mary from unwanted publicity.\u00a0Charles and Mary were forced to move often due to Mary\u2019s notoriety. In 1823 they adopted an orphan, Emma Isola, who lived with them for a decade until marrying their publisher. Charles died in 1834, and Mary was cared for by family members and a nurse, and at times placed in asylums, until her death in 1847.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Romantic"]}}
