His parents were Litvak Jews who emigrated from Eastern Europe to the United States before World War I. His family spoke Yiddish at home.\u00a0Feinman was educated at Brooklyn College, the University of Chicago, and Yale University.\nFeinman was revered for his teaching but also for his sole poetry collection, Preambles and Other Poems, (1964), which would be reissued, along with a handful of additional work, as Poems (1990).\u00a0When Preambles appeared, critics including Conrad Aiken, Allen Tate, R.W.B. Lewis, and Harold Bloom\u2014a friend of Feinman's dating back to their graduate years at Yale\u2014praised the book. \u201cThe best of Alvin Feinman\u2019s poetry is as good as anything by a twentieth-century American,\u201d Bloom said. \u201cHis work achieves the greatness of the American sublime.\u201d Bloom devoted a section of his book The Ringers in the Tower (1971) to Feinman, comparing him to Hart Crane and Wallace Stevens, as well as a chapter in Possessed by Memory, published a few months before Bloom\u2019s death in 2019.\nFeinman\u2019s poetry is metaphysically dense and lyrically ravishing, exploring how the mind makes meaning through, with, and despite language. In part because he published so sparsely, Feinman remained little read and largely unknown when he died in 2008. \nThe posthumous Corrupted into Song: The Complete Poems of Alvin Feinman (Princeton UP, 2016) was edited by his widow, Deborah Dorfman. \u201cAlvin Feinman\u2019s poems are perhaps the purest evidence of the extinction of personality T.S. Eliot believed was one of poetry\u2019s necessities,\u201d the poet Michael Collier wrote of Corrupted into Song. \u201cAs an aspiration, extinction of personality is as dangerously thrilling as being exposed to a siren\u2019s song. As an achievement, Feinman\u2019s exquisite, visionary poems, tied to the mast of their own making, allow us to behold fierce, unyielding perceptions.\u201d\nFeinman taught at Bennington College from 1969 to 1994. He died in 2008. \n", "attrs": {}}
