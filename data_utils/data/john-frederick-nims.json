Born in Muskegon, Michigan, Nims studied at DePaul University, the University of Notre Dame, and the University of Chicago, where he earned his PhD. He taught at Harvard University, the University of Florence, the University of Toronto, Williams College, the University of Missouri, and the University of Illinois at Chicago. From 1978 to 1984 he was the editor of Poetry magazine.\n\r\nSince his first book appeared in 1947, many reviewers have praised the intelligence and wit exhibited in his poems and translations. M.L. Rosenthal, reviewing\u00a0The Iron Pastoral\u00a0for the\u00a0New York Herald Tribune,\u00a0wrote: \u201cNims\u2019s first book of poetry reveals sprightly wit combined with social and moral integrity, sensuous responsiveness combined with an inquisitive intellect. He is capable of being very light and playful.\u201d\u00a0Horace Gregory\u00a0in the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0lauded Nims for writing\u00a0The Iron Pastoral\u00a0(1947) in \u201ca new language\u2014often witty and brilliant,\u201d while William Rose Benet, reviewing the book for the\u00a0Saturday Review of Literature,\u00a0said: \u201cThe work of John Frederick Nims seems to me to rank high among modern verse. ... Ordinarily his sense of balance and sense of humor do not fail him.\u201d J.P. Clancy, in a review of\u00a0Knowledge of the Evening (1960)\u00a0for\u00a0Commonweal,\u00a0observed that Nims had \u201ca very real gift for irony, for colloquial wit,\u201d and Walker Gibson of the\u00a0Nation\u00a0attributed the author\u2019s success to his \u201ccraftsmanship and wit and educated sensibility.\u201d\n\r\nNims also authored Five Young American Poets (1944), A Fountain in Kentucky (1950), Selected Poems (1982), The Kiss: A Jambalaya (1982), The Six-Cornered Snowflake and Other Poems (1990), Zany in Denim (1990), and Western Wind (1992). He received a Guggenheim Fellowship, an Academy of American Poets Fellowship, the O.B. Hardison Prize, the Aiken Taylor Award for Modern American Poetry, and a National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities grant, among other awards.\n\r\nNims\u2019s work as a translator, specifically in\u00a0Sappho to Valery (1971),\u00a0a collection of poems translated from nine languages, has been widely acclaimed. Nims\u2019s renditions, according to Philip Murray in\u00a0Poetry,\u00a0are \u201cabsolute miracles ... [and his]; introductory remarks on Sappho are particularly sensible. He cuts through jungles of nonsense with a sharp and witty pen. ... Rarely in the translators\u2019 art have such knowledge, skill, sensitivity and breadth of interest coincided so felicitously in a single hand.\u201d Vernon Young called\u00a0Sappho to Valery\u00a0\u201cone of those books I would not willingly live without, once having made its acquaintance.\u201d In the\u00a0Hudson Review,\u00a0Young expressed \u201cpure delight with Nims\u2019s craftsmanship; his wit, his common sense and his resolve to convey a poem\u2019s form as accurately as possible, or, where accuracy is plainly impossible to render, to invent, with spectacular result, an incredible paraphrase which you feel must be more inspired than the original.\u201d Brewster Ghiselin found that \u201cin reading the translation, it is as if the scene and mood of the original were re-experienced under almost identical conditions of place and time.\u201d Writing in the\u00a0Sewanee Review,\u00a0Ghiselin cited one reason for the success of Nims\u2019s translations: \u201cHe constantly feels the allurement and excitement of the original poetry, and answers it as a poet, with poetry.\u201d\n\r\nAnother translation of note,\u00a0The Complete Poems of Michelangelo (1998), appeared the year before Nims\u2019s death. Though often translated before, the several hundred poems of Michelangelo receive a unique treatment at the hands of Nims, for, as James M. Saslow noted in the\u00a0Renaissance Quarterly,\u00a0\u201cunlike most other Michelangelo translators, Nims was a poet in his own right, whose English renderings are generally fluid and clear despite the discipline of elaborate rhyme schemes.\u201d Saslow went on to note that Nims was unafraid to update the language in these poems, \u201ceschewing formality to nudge, and sometimes shove, Michelangelo\u2019s vocabulary toward the slangy, abrupt, and colorful.\u201d Neither does Nims shy away from the artist\u2019s \u201chomoerotic feelings,\u201d as Charles Cagle noted in the\u00a0Midwest Quarterly.\u00a0According to Cagle, \u201ctranslator Nims does not avoid the obvious,\u201d and includes in his edition \u201ca series of pulsatingly romantic poems to a wildly attractive, twenty-three-year-old aristocrat.\u201d For Ronald L. Martinez, reviewing the collection in\u00a0Insight on the News,\u00a0Nims\u2019s is a \u201cliberal translation of the poetry of Michelangelo [that] gives the artist\u2019s voice a contemporary, if often rather brusque, quality.\u201d Martinez went on to note that Nims \u201coften seems to posit a Michelangelo capable of a wry, ironic stance before his troubles,\u201d and concluded, \u201cTwo cheers, then, for Nims\u2019s vivid reinventions. These surely are the most compelling translations of Michelangelo available in English.\u201d Daniel Kunitz, reviewing the collection in the\u00a0Times Literary Supplement,\u00a0felt that Nims\u2019s poems were \u201cnot meant as literal translations but as versions of Michelangelo\u2019s compositions.\u201d Kunitz also felt such renditions were true to the spirit of the originals: \u201cHappily, John Nims\u2019s efforts do not break free of their parent poems. Like strong-gened offspring, they have inherited the noble and distinctive features of their progenitors.\u201d\n\r\nIn 2002 a collection of verses from Nims\u2019s eight previous poetry books as well as 30 new poems were published in\u00a0The Powers of Heaven and Earth: New and Selected Poems.\u00a0Reviewing the anthology in\u00a0Poetry,\u00a0Pugh recalled that Nims was a \u201cwizard of epigrams, a genre practiced too infrequently today; and this book affords the rare poetic \u2018laugh out loud.\u2019\u201d For Pugh, this posthumous volume \u201cshows Nims\u2019s long journey in his own voice and to his own voice.\u201d Gathered here are some of Nims\u2019s earliest work, such as \u201cDollar Bill,\u201d and some of his last works, including \u201cFreight,\u201d a sonnet sequence.\u00a0Booklist\u2019s Ray Olson, in a starred review, called the work\u2014selected by Nims before his death\u2014a \u201cbrilliant valedictory collection.\u201d\n", "attrs": {}}
