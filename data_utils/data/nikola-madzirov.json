Madzirov\u2019s poetry examines both personal and cultural geography in order to trace the nature of our movement across those landscapes. In a review of Remnants of Another Age in the Tottenville Review, Mike Walker notes, \u201c[O]ften in Madzirov\u2019s poetry, there is a sense of escape but also a sense of the imperative for such escape. The characters who people his poems are half the time in transit, in flight, and half the time already gone. There is a sense of autumnal winsomeness yet also a feeling of suspense in his work.\u201d In a 2011 interview with L.A. Grove for the California Journal of Poetics,\u00a0Madzirov addressed the nature of translation, stating, \u201cThere are many poems in which we can recognize ourselves without having written them, just as there are cities where we have imagined ourselves much earlier before we travel there. The translator is a silent deconstructor, a night guard of the bridges of difference and understanding.\u201d \u00a0 He is the author of several collections of poetry including Studentski Zbor award-winner Locked in the City (1999), Aco Karamanov Award-winner Somewhere Nowhere (1999), and Huberta Burda Award-winner Relocated Stone (2007). Poet Carolyn Forch\u00e9 wrote the foreword to a volume of his selected poems, Remnants of Another Age (2011, translated by Peggy Reid, Graham Reid, Magdalena Horvat, and Adam Reed). Madzirov\u2019s work has been translated into more than thirty languages. \u00a0 His additional honors include the Hubert Burda European Poetry Award, the Miladinov Brothers poetry prize and residencies at the University of Iowa\u2019s International Writing Program, LiteraturRaum in Berlin, KulturKontakt in Vienna, Literatur Haus N\u00d6 in Krems, and Villa Waldberta in Munich. He has served as Macedonian coordinator for the international poetry network for Lyrikline and as poetry editor for the Macedonian online journal Blesok.\u00a0 Madzirov lives in Macedonia.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Eastern Europe"]}}
