At this festival, the San Francisco Renaissance poetry movement\u2014a West Coast school of poetry aesthetically distinct from the Beats\u2014began to coalesce.Gleason\u2019s poetry collections include The Metaphysical Needle (1949), Concerto for Bell and Telephone (1966), Here Comes Everybody: New & Selected Poems (1975), and the posthumously-published Collected Poems: 1919\u20131979 (1999), which contained several previously-unpublished poems and an essay by Gleason on her poetics. Her work was also included in Donald Allen\u2019s classic anthology, The New American Poetry 1945\u20131960 (1960).Employed by a brokerage firm for more than 20 years, Gleason also taught at the San Francisco State College Poetry Center.
