In Lucifer, Memmer reimagines the age-old character as God\u2019s first son, whose rebellion against his Father is an act of self-making, not war-making: confronted with the reality of death in God\u2019s new creation, Lucifer leaves Paradise as an act of solidarity and defiance\u2014a decision he wrestles with throughout the collection. In The Storehouses of the Snow, Memmer writes psalms to a god that is \u201calways ceasing / to be, and then ceasing / to cease to be.\u201d\u2028\r\n\u00a0\r\nMemmer lives in upstate New York, where he works as executive director of the Arts Branch of the YMCA of Greater Syracuse. In 2001, he founded the YMCA\u2019s Downtown Writer\u2019s Center, a literary arts center in downtown Syracuse. He also serves as associate editor for Tiger Bark Press.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
