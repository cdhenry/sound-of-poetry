His epigrammatic poems have been associated with the work of the Greek Cynics, though most of his poetry has been lost; what does survive are his contributions to the Anthologia Graeca, an ancient anthology of literary and erotic epigrams that he also edited. Meleager also compiled the Stephanos (or Garland, ~100 BCE), the earliest known anthology of literary epigrams, selected from work composed in the prior two centuries. Meleager\u2019s own surviving poems are mainly erotic epigrams, which treat boys and women with both affection and cynicism.  \u00a0 Translations of Meleager\u2019s verse into English include a selection in Daryl Hine\u2019s Puerilities: Erotic Epigrams of The Greek Anthology (2001) and Richard Aldington\u2019s The Poems of Meleager of Gadara (1920).\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Greece"]}}
