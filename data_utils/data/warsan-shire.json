She is the author of the collections\u00a0Teaching My Mother How to Give Birth (flipped eye, 2011), Her Blue Body\u00a0(flipped eye, 2015), Our Men Do Not Belong to Us (Slapering Hol Press and Poetry Foundation,\u00a02015), and Bless The Daughter Raised By A Voice In Her Head (Random House, forthcoming 2021).\u00a0Her poems have appeared in journals and magazines, including Poetry Review, Wasafiri, and Sable LitMag;\u00a0in the anthologies\u00a0Salt Book of Younger Poets (2011),\u00a0Long Journeys: African Migrants on the Road\u00a0(2013), and Poems That Make Grown Women Cry\u00a0(2016);\u00a0as well as in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s visual album\u00a0Lemonade (2016) and film\u00a0Black Is King (2020).\nAccording to Alexis Okeowo in the New Yorker, Shire\u2019s work \u201cembodies the kind of shape-shifting, culture-juggling spirit lurking in most people who can\u2019t trace their ancestors to their country\u2019s founding fathers, or whose ancestors look nothing like those fathers. In that limbo, Shire conjures up a new language for belonging and displacement.\u201d Shire\u2019s poems connect gender, war, sex, and cultural assumptions; in her work, poetry is a healing agent for the trauma of exile and suffering. In an interview, Shire noted, \u201cCharacter driven poetry is important for me\u2014it\u2019s being able to tell the stories of those people, especially refugees and immigrants, that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be told, or they\u2019ll be told really inaccurately. And I don\u2019t want to write victims, or martyrs, or vacuous stereotypes \u2026 my family are really amazing\u2014they\u2019ll tell me, \u2018I have a new story for you,\u2019 and I\u2019ll get my Dictaphone and record it, so I can stay as true as possible to the story before I make it into a poem.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nShire has read her work in South Africa, Italy, Germany, and the United States. In 2013, she won Brunel University\u2019s first African Poetry Prize. In 2014, she was named the first Young Poet Laureate for London and chosen as poet-in-residence for Queensland, Australia. In 2017 she was included in the Penguin Modern Poets series. In 2019 she wrote the short film Brave Girl Rising, narrated by Tess Thompson and David Oyelowo, and became the youngest person to ever be inducted into the Royal Society of Literature.\nShire is poetry editor of Spook Magazine and guest edited Young Sable LitMag.\n", "attrs": {}}
