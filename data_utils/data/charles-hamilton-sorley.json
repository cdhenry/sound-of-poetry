The son of a William Ritchie Sorley, a professor of moral philosophy, Charles was a precocious and academically gifted child. The family moved to Cambridge when he was five, and Sorley attended King\u2019s College choir school and Marlborough College, with some study in Germany. He began publishing poetry in the school journal\u00a0and won a scholarship to University College, Oxford. Sorley was in Germany in 1914 when World War I broke out, and he was interned for one night in prison at Trier. Making his way back to England, he enlisted in the Army and served in the trenches in France. Sorley was killed in the Battle of Loos at the age of 20. His last poem, \u201cWhen You See Millions of the Mouthless Dead\u201d was discovered in his kitbag after his death.\r\n\u00a0\r\nA collection of Sorley\u2019s poetry was published posthumously as Marlborough and other Poems (1916) and went through six editions in the first year. Because of his time in Germany, Sorley\u2019s attitude toward the war was deeply conflicted from its start. His small body of poetry is ambivalent, ironic, and profound. Robert Graves described Sorley as \u201cone of the three poets of importance killed during the war,\u201d alongside Wilfred Owen and Isaac Rosenberg. His other works include The Collected Poems of Charles Hamilton Sorley (1985).\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Scotland"]}}
