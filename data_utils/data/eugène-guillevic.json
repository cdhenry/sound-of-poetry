His father was a sailor and later a gendarme in Alsace, where Guillevic attended College d\u2019Altkirch. Though he first started publishing during the height of the surrealist movement, his first book, Requiem (1938), steered clear of its tendencies and tactics. Instead of surrealist images, Guillevic\u2019s poetry favored objects, spare diction, and simple presentation and owed debts to La Fontaine\u2019s fables, which Guillevic learned by heart. James Kirkup wrote, in an obituary and appreciation for Guillevic, \u201cHis work has a pure unadorned openness concealing even in its most minimal forms a mysterious singing power.\u201d Guillevic published many collections of poetry in France, including Executoire (1947), Carnac (1961), Autres: po\u00e8mes 1969\u20131979 (1980), the nearly-200-page Art po\u00e8tique (1989), and numerous others. Many collections were published posthumously, including Quotidiennes: Po\u00e8mes, Novembre 1994\u2013D\u00e9cembre 1996 (2002), and Pr\u00e9sent, poems 1987\u20131997 (2004).  \u00a0 From 1946 to 1963, Guillevic was the Inspecteur d\u2019Economie Nationale, a career that perhaps contributed to his work\u2019s precise, at times mathematical, rigor. Guillevic is often associated with poets and writers Jean Follain, Raymond Queneau, Jean Tardieu, and Jean Tortel. He collaborated with many printers and artists, producing numerous fine art and poetry editions. Guillevic received Le Grand Prix de Po\u00e9sie from the French Academy and Le Grand Prix National de Po\u00e9sie.  \u00a0 There are few translations of Guillevic\u2019s work into English. In 1969, New Directions released Selected Poems, translated by Denise Levertov. In her introduction, Levertov notes that the poems\u2019 \u201csimplicity of diction, the plain and hard meaning of things without descriptive qualification, reverberates \u2026 with the ambiguity, the unfathomable mystery of natural objects.\u201d Other translations include Carnac (trans. John Montague, 2000), a collection of interviews Living in Poetry (trans. Maureen Smith, 2000), and The Sea & Other Poems (trans. Patricia Terry, 2007). Richard Sieburth\u2019s translation of Guillevic\u2019s Euclidiennes (1967) was published as Geometries (2010).\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"]}}
