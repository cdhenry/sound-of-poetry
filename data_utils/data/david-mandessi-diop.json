He lived much of his life in France but also spent significant time in West Africa, where he was a strong supporter of the movement for independence from French colonial rule. He died at the age of 33 in an airplane crash on his way home to France from Dakar.  \u00a0 Diop was educated at the Lyc\u00e9e Marcelin Berthelot in Paris. Influenced by the work of Martinique poet Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, Diop composed poems of political resistance, recalling the power of a free Africa and vividly portraying the oppression of French colonialist rule. Rejecting assimilation into European culture and rhythms, Diop frequently used colloquial and spoken phrasings patterned with rhythmic repetition.  \u00a0 At age 15, Diop began publishing his poems regularly in the literary journal Pr\u00e9sence Africaine, and five of his poems were featured in L\u00e9opold Senghor\u2019s Anthologie de la nouvelle po\u00e9sie n\u00e9gre et malgache (1948). He published only one short book of poems during his lifetime, Coups de pilon\u00a0(Pounding)\u00a0(1956). Hammer Blows and Other Writings (1973, translated and edited by Simon Mpondo and Frank Jones), a posthumous translation, was expanded to include a selection of the poet\u2019s previously uncollected prose.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Africa"]}}
