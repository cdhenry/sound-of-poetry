With Rosmarie Waldrop he co-edits Burning Deck Press.Waldrop was born in Emporia, Kansas in 1932. He enrolled in the pre-med program at Kansas State Teacher\u2019s College, but his studies were interrupted in 1953 when he was drafted into the US Army. While stationed in Germany during the 1950s, Waldrop met his wife, the poet and translator Rosmarie Waldrop. He earned a PhD in comparative literature in 1964 from the University of Michigan and has taught at Brown University since 1968.\u00a0 In addition to being an internationally celebrated poet, Waldrop is a respected translator of French literature.\u00a0 His translations include writing by Claude Royet-Journoud, Anne-Marie Albiach, Edmond Jab\u00e8s, and most recently Charles Baudelaire\u2019s Les Fleurs du Mal. The French Government has given him the rank of \u201cChevalier des arts et des letters.\u201dWaldrop\u2019s poetry navigates concerns that are at once personal and philosophical by representing a world that is endlessly strange and fascinating. As A.L. Nielsen has said of Waldrop\u2019s poety: \u201cKeith Waldrop has concerned himself with the topology of the world of writing more consistently and valuably than any poet I can think of since the late Paul Celan. There is, in Waldrop's work, a steady thought directed to the way that we make our way in the world by thinking and speaking. Where Wallace Stevens gave us the portrait of a man bothered by the march of ants through his shadow, Waldrop gives us the disturbances of the world in its representations.\u201dUpon receiving the National Book Award, the judges said of Waldrop\u2019s poetry: \u201cIf transcendental immanence were possible, it would be because Keith Waldrop had invented it; he\u2019s the only one who could\u2014and in Transcendental Studies he has. These three linked series achieve a fusion arcing from the Romantic to the Postmodern that demonstrates language\u2019s capacity to go to extremes\u2014and to haul daily lived experience right along with it: life imitates language, and when language becomes these poems, life itself gets more various, more volatile, more vital.\u201dIn addition to winning a National Book Award, Waldrop has received an NEA Fellowship for translation, a stipend from the DAAD Berlin Artists\u2019 Program, and a Fund for Poetry Award.\u00a0 His poetry has been translated into French, German, and Danish.\n", "attrs": {}}
