McClatchy was born and raised in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. He earned his BA at Georgetown University and his PhD in English at Yale University. His poetry is marked by formal adeptness, lyrical control and a wide range of influences\u2014including classical literature, music, and opera. Praised for his poetry's polished, erudite surfaces as well as the depths of thought, philosophy, and feeling beneath the facade, McClatchy treats subjects as diverse as Japanese history, the body, and his own autobiography. Often depicting the unsettling and disturbing realities that exist below the surfaces of our lives, McClatchy\u2019s poems are sensitive and intelligent explorations of the moral and aesthetic scope of human experience. His collections of poetry include Star Principal (1986), The Rest of the Way (1990), and The Ten Commandments (1998). In a review of McClatchy\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-nominated Hazmat (2002), Adam Kirsch noted the \u201cintricate stanza forms, historical anecdotes and exotic settings\u201d of the poems, writing that McClatchy\u2019s \u201cbest poems escape anemia through regular infusions of the body\u2019s \u2018spurting, desperate\u2019 blood.\u201d McClatchy\u2019s next collection, Mercury Dressing (2009) won the Ambassador Book Award, a prize recognizing literature that adds significantly to an understanding of American life and culture. Speaking to Contemporary Authors about his own work, McClatchy noted, \u201cI continue to write two sorts of poem\u2014one that will at first seem intensely lyrical, private, even hermetic; and the other, by contrast, more 'open,' discursive or autobiographical. To my mind, the poems arise from the same impulse played at different pitches. What has changed in my work, though, is its increasingly political emphasis. I am not interested in 'issues,' but in the nature, responsibilities, and methods of power. Contemporary politics and ideologies are metaphors for this\u2014as classical mythology has always been. The poet's business, after all, is not merely to describe the world, but to create urgent new myths from it, and for it.\u201d\n\r\nIn addition to writing poetry, J.D. McClatchy was a prolific editor, leading critic, notable librettist, and celebrated teacher. He wrote opera libretti for Francis Thorne\u2019s Mario and the Magician, Bruce Saylor\u2019s Orpheus Descending, Tobias Picker\u2019s Emmeline, and William Schuman\u2019s A Question of Taste. A prolific and esteemed editor, a selection of McClatchy\u2019s titles includes The Vintage Book of Contemporary American Poetry (1990 and 2003), Poets of the Civil War (2005), Poems of the Sea (2001), James Merrill\u2019s Collected Prose (2004) and Collected Poems (2001), and Bright Pages: Yale Writers 1701\u20132001 (2001). McClatchy\u2019s first collection of essays, White Paper (1989), won the Melville Cane award from the Poetry Society of America. His second, Twenty Questions: (Posed by Poems) (1998) was released the same year as his acclaimed volume of poetry, Ten Commandments. The autobiographical elements in Ten Commandments are elaborated on in Twenty Questions, and the poetic philosophy that McClatchy expresses in the essays is reflected in the style of his poems. Writing in the New Leader, Phoebe Pettingell felt that \"vivid observations can be found throughout both the poems and the essays,\" and Poetry contributor Christian Wiman commended the \"autobiographical elegance\" of McClatchy's prose.\n\r\nMcClatchy received numerous commendations for his work, including the Award in Literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1991 for his collection The Rest of the Way. He also received fellowships from the Guggenheim and the National Endowment for the Arts, a Connecticut Governor\u2019s Award, and a Literary Lion commendation from the New York Public Library. \u00a0He served as Chancellor to the Academy of American Poets from 1996 to 2003. McClatchy taught at Princeton University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, and for several decades at Yale University, where he edited the Yale Review.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
