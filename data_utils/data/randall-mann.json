He is also the author of a book of criticism, The Illusion of Intimacy: On Poetry (2019), as well as co-author of the textbook\u00a0Writing Poems\u00a0(2007). Influenced by Philip Larkin, Elizabeth Bishop, and Donald Justice, Mann\u2019s poetry\u2014at once vulnerable, unflinching, and brave in its ambivalence\u2014explores themes of loss, attraction, brutality, and expectation. Of his preference for working in form, Mann says, \u201cForm helps me approach more comfortably the personal, helps me harden argument.\u201d\nDavid Baker, poetry editor and judge for the Kenyon Review Prize, wrote that in his first book Mann \u201cre-creates the landscape and flora of the Caribbean and Florida with great precision, its saw palmettos and egrets, its \u2018feathery-leafed locusts\u2019 and \u2018punctual monsoons.\u2019 He follows, in other words, a long line of observers from Donald Justice back through William Bartram to Ponce de Le\u00f3n and Cabeza de Vaca.\u201d Mann\u2019s later work also observes the vicissitudes of place, in particular San Francisco. Reviewing Proprietary, Tess Taylor noted,\u00a0\u201cThe poems in this collection also straddle the distance between a San Francisco of hedonistic pleasures and a San Francisco of corporate doublespeak. In echoing that earlier city, Mann evokes Thom Gunn, a noted San Francisco poet or even Baudelaire, a poet of raw urban desire. But in threading these poems about lust, longing and alienation through a brave new world of org charts and web portals, Mann imagines anew what it means to connect or to feel at a loss in the age of the Internet.\u201d\nMann received the 2013 J. Howard and Barbara M.J. Wood Prize from Poetry. He lives in San Francisco.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
