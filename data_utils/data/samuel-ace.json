Critic Rebecca Brown wrote of Ace\u2019s work: \u201cStein hovers behind, above, beneath these brazen texts. Like her modernist forebear, Smukler uses the most direct and plain American idiom to render the complexity and anguish, and the humor of desire.\"\nWith Maureen Seaton, Ace coauthored Stealth (2011). As Linda Smukler, Ace published the collections Home in three days. Don\u2019t wash. (1996) and Normal Sex (1994), a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award in Poetry. With Susan Fox Rogers, Smukler coedited Portraits of Love: Lesbians Writing About Love (1997).\nAce\u2019s work has been featured in several anthologies, including BAX 2016: Best American Experimental Writing (2017), Troubling the Line: Trans and Genderqueer Poetry and Poetics (2013), and The House of Your Dream: An International Collection of Prose Poetry (2008).\nAce has received fellowships from the New York Foundation for the Arts and the Astraea Foundation as well as the Katherine Anne Porter Prize for Fiction and the Firecracker Alternative Book Award.\nHe lives in Tucson, Arizona, and in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
