He was the son of an army doctor and was raised by his great-uncle in the Mortefontaine countryside while his parents traveled to the front. His mother died when he was two years old. In 1828, Labrunie published a widely praised translation of Goethe\u2019s Faust. After a manic episode in 1841 that led to a diagnosis of insanity and an extended hospitalization, he took the name Nerval.\nIn his experimental poetry and prose, Nerval explores the liminal spaces among imagination and reality and creativity and madness while lucidly recording his experiences as a subject of 19th-century psychiatry. His work can be seen as a connection between the movements of French Romanticism and symbolism, and he was cited as an influence by Marcel Proust, Andr\u00e9 Breton, Antonin Artaud, and T.S. Eliot, whose long poem \u201cThe Waste Land\u201d concludes with a quote by Nerval.\nAn overview of Nerval\u2019s work, including poetry, experimental fiction, a novella, and a selection of correspondence, can be found in G\u00e9rard de Nerval: Selected Writings, translated and annotated by Richard Sieburth (1999). Nerval\u2019s sonnet sequence Les Chim\u00e8res (1854, translated as The Chimeras by Peter Jay in 1985), written over the course of ten years, was published the year before his death by suicide at the age of 46.\nNerval\u2019s memoir Aur\u00e9lia (1853\u20131854) records his hallucinations and experiences during periods of mental instability. His additional publications include Les Filles du feu (The Daughters of Fire, 1854), which includes his 1853 novella Sylvie; Sc\u00e8nes de la vie orientale (1848\u20131850); Contes et fac\u00e9ties (1852); La Boh\u00eame galante (1856); and L'Alchimiste, a drama in five acts, written in collaboration with Alexandre Dumas.\nNerval was said to have taken his pet lobster for a walk in the gardens of the Palais-Royal in Paris one day, using a blue ribbon for a leash, a story often relayed as a humorous anecdote. In an essay for the Harper\u2019s Magazine blog, Scott Horton situates this account within the context of a poem by Nerval that opens with an epigraph by Pythagoras: \u201cAll things feel.\u201d Horton states, \u201cWhen Nerval proudly took his lobster for a promenade, he was making the same point he made in this poem: humans make themselves the masters of their environment and the beasts around them, and in so doing have they not lost a sense of the universe and the natural order among beings? Do they not recognize obligations that go with that mastery? It was not, perhaps, quite so comic an act as it may have seemed.\u201d\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"], "School/Period:": ["Romantic"]}}
