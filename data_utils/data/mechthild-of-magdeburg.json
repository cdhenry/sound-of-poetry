She experienced her first religious vision at the age of 12, and apparitions appeared to her daily thereafter. In 1230, she left her home to become a beguine, one of a group of evangelical women who took vows together but chose to live in the world rather than a convent. Mechthild\u2019s seven-volume book, The Flowing Light of the Godhead, was one of the first German mystic texts composed in vernacular Low German rather than Latin. In 1250, she began writing the mix of prose revelations and poems that characterize The Flowing Light of the Godhead and completed the final volume 14 years later. Her devotional poems echo courtly love poetry as well as folk songs. Her book is both an account of her own ecstatic, passionate experience of divine vision and a fearless condemnation of vices she observed in the local clergy. Some scholars believe her account of the afterworld influenced Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy. Though translated into Latin during her lifetime, her book was largely forgotten after her death until its rediscovery in the late 19th century. The original Low German version of the book has been lost, and a High German translation is the earliest version remaining. Jane Hirshfield included a sampling of Mechthild\u2019s poetry in the anthology Women in Praise of the Sacred: 43 Centuries of Spiritual Poetry by Women (1994). Mechthild\u2019s work has also gained recent attention from feminist scholars, including Sara S. Poor, author of Mechthild of Magdeburg and Her Book: Gender and the Making of Textual Authority (2004). Around 1270, Mechthild joined the Cistercian nuns at Helfta, near Eisleben, and lived in their convent until her death.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Germany"]}}
