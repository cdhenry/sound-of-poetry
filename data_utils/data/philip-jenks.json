He earned a BA from Reed College, an MA in creative writing from Boston University, and a PhD in political science from the University of Kentucky. His books of poetry include On the Cave You Live In (2002), My First Painting Will Be \u201cThe Accuser\u201d (2005), Disappearing Address (2010, with Simone Muench), and Colony Collapse Metaphor\u00a0(2014); and\u00a0the chapbooks\u00a0How Many of You Are You? (2006), and Little Visceral Carnival (2009, with Simone Muench).\nIn response to Jenks\u2019s poem \u201cUntitled\u201d (\u201cMy pinhole weighs a ton\u201d), poet Dan Beachy-Quick commented, \u201cIn Jenks\u2019s work, the bewildering ways in which absence presents itself in word and image, and how presence absents itself by the same means, is poetry\u2019s work.\u201d In a review of On the Cave You Live In, Jon Curley noted, \u201cJenks coalesces his themes around language which is often peripheral in its presumed scope and oblique in its descriptions. Among the artifacts that compose the Jenks universe: the depredations and dignity of Appalachian life, Biblical glosses and vatic tunings, playfully obscure confessions and catastrophic revelations.\u201d\nJenks' poems have appeared in\u00a0Chicago Review, Typo, Fence, Cultural Society, H_NGM_N, Canarium, LVNG,\u00a0and elsewhere.\u00a0He is an educator and resides in Chicago.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
