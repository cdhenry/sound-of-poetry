He started out as a cartoonist, publishing work in Playboy and the military publication Stars & Stripes, before turning to children\u2019s books. Silverstein is the author and illustrator of numerous books, including The Giving Tree (1964), Where the Sidewalk Ends (1974), A Light in the Attic (1981), and Falling Up (1996). His books have been commended for their appeal to both adults and children.\nSilverstein\u2019s poems are often darkly humorous, irreverent, and populated with invented characters, such as the \u201cBloath\u201d in Where the Sidewalk Ends, who dwells \u201c[i]n the undergrowth\u201d and \u201cfeeds upon poets and tea.\u201d Silverstein\u2019s poems and stories are accompanied by his simple yet energetic pen-and-ink illustrations. The Giving Tree, a fable about a lifelong relationship between a boy and a tree, has become a classic in the canon of children\u2019s literature and has sold over five million copies.\nAs a songwriter, Silverstein wrote \u201cThe Cover of the Rolling Stone,\u201d recorded by Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show; \u201cUnicorn Song,\u201d for the Irish Rovers; \u201cA Boy Named Sue,\u201d for Johnny Cash; and \u201cQueen of the Silver Dollar,\u201d which Emmylou Harris covered on Pieces of the Sky. Silverstein collaborated with playwright David Mamet on the screenplay Things Change (1988), and they and Elaine May staged a series of one-act plays called Oh, Hell (1991).\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
