He is the author and illustrator of Polkabats and Octopus Slacks: 14 Stories (1998), a collection of story poems that won the Marion Vannett Ridgeway Award for Poetry; Dutch Sneakers and Fleakeepers: 14 More Stories (2000), a Parents\u2019 Choice Recommended Winner; Tippintown: A Guided Tour (2003); Flamingoes on the Roof: Poems and Paintings (2006), winner of the Myra Cohn Livingston Award for Poetry and a 2007 Children\u2019s Book Council Choice; Soup for Breakfast: Poems and Pictures (2008); and Hallowilloween: Nefarious Silliness (2010). Using engaging and nonsensical characters, Brown crafts narrative story-poems using a jazzy beat. In interviews, he has cited wordplay, dreams, and the rhythms of music as inspirations.\r\nA well-known illustrator, Brown carries a notebook for daily sketching and has illustrated the work of a variety of authors, including Daniel Pinkwater, Edward Lear, and Jonah Winter. Brown\u2019s illustrations have also appeared in Newsweek, The New Yorker, Rolling Stone, Time, and Travel + Leisure. He has taught illustration at the Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles, the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, and the Maine College of Art in Portland. \ufeff\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Northwestern"]}}
