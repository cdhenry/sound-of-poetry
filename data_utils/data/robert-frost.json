The move was actually a return, for Frost\u2019s ancestors were originally New Englanders, and Frost became famous for his poetry\u2019s engagement with New England locales, identities, and themes. Frost graduated from Lawrence High School, in 1892, as class poet (he also shared the honor of co-valedictorian with his wife-to-be Elinor White), and two years later, the New York Independent accepted his poem entitled \u201cMy Butterfly,\u201d launching his status as a professional poet with a check for $15.00. Frost's first book was published around the age of 40, but he would go on to win a record four Pulitzer Prizes and become the most famous poet of his time, before his death at the age of 88.\r\n\u00a0\r\nTo celebrate his first publication, Frost had a book of six poems privately printed; two copies of Twilight were made\u2014one for himself and one for his fiancee. Over the next eight years, however, he succeeded in having only 13 more poems published. During this time, Frost sporadically attended Dartmouth and Harvard and earned a living teaching school and, later, working a farm in Derry, New Hampshire. But in 1912, discouraged by American magazines\u2019 constant rejection of his work, he took his family to England, where he found more professional success. Continuing to write about New England, he had two books published, A Boy\u2019s Will (1913) and North of Boston (1914), which established his reputation so that his return to the United States in 1915 was as a celebrated literary figure. Holt put out an American edition of North of Boston in 1915, and periodicals that had once scorned his work now sought it.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nFrost\u2019s position in American letters was cemented with the publication of North of Boston, and in the years before his death he came to be considered the unofficial poet laureate of the United States. On his 75th birthday, the US Senate passed a resolution in his honor which said, \u201cHis poems have helped to guide American thought and humor and wisdom, setting forth to our minds a reliable representation of ourselves and of all men.\u201d In 1955, the State of Vermont named a mountain after him in Ripton, the town of his legal residence; and at the presidential inauguration of John F. Kennedy in 1961, Frost was given the unprecedented honor of being asked to read a poem. Frost wrote a poem called \u201cDedication\u201d for the occasion, but could not read it given the day\u2019s harsh sunlight. He instead recited \u201cThe Gift Outright,\u201d which Kennedy had originally asked him to read, with a revised, more forward-looking, last line.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThough Frost allied himself with no literary school or movement, the imagists helped at the start to promote his American reputation. Poetry: A Magazine of Verse published his work before others began to clamor for it. It also published a review by Ezra Pound of the British edition of A Boy\u2019s Will, which Pound said \u201chas the tang of the New Hampshire woods, and it has just this utter sincerity. It is not post-Miltonic or post-Swinburnian or post Kiplonian. This man has the good sense to speak naturally and to paint the thing, the thing as he sees it.\u201d Amy Lowell reviewed North of Boston in the New Republic, and she, too, sang Frost\u2019s praises: \u201cHe writes in classic metres in a way to set the teeth of all the poets of the older schools on edge; and he writes in classic metres, and uses inversions and cliches whenever he pleases, those devices so abhorred by the newest generation. He goes his own way, regardless of anyone else\u2019s rules, and the result is a book of unusual power and sincerity.\u201d In these first two volumes, Frost introduced not only his affection for New England themes and his unique blend of traditional meters and colloquialism, but also his use of dramatic monologues and dialogues. \u201cMending Wall,\u201d the leading poem in North of Boston, describes the friendly argument between the speaker and his neighbor as they walk along their common wall replacing fallen stones; their differing attitudes toward \u201cboundaries\u201d offer symbolic significance typical of the poems in these early collections.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\nMountain Interval marked Frost\u2019s turn to another kind of poem, a brief meditation sparked by an object, person or event. Like the monologues and dialogues, these short pieces have a dramatic quality. \u201cBirches,\u201d discussed above, is an example, as is \u201cThe Road Not Taken,\u201d in which a fork in a woodland path transcends the specific. The distinction of this volume, the Boston Transcript said, \u201cis that Mr. Frost takes the lyricism of A Boy\u2019s Will and plays a deeper music and gives a more intricate variety of experience.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nSeveral new qualities emerged in Frost\u2019s work with the appearance of New Hampshire (1923), particularly a new self-consciousness and willingness to speak of himself and his art. The volume, for which Frost won his first Pulitzer Prize, \u201cpretends to be nothing but a long poem with notes and grace notes,\u201d as Louis Untermeyer described it. The title poem, approximately fourteen pages long, is a \u201crambling tribute\u201d to Frost\u2019s favorite state and \u201cis starred and dotted with scientific numerals in the manner of the most profound treatise.\u201d Thus, a footnote at the end of a line of poetry will refer the reader to another poem seemingly inserted to merely reinforce the text of \u201cNew Hampshire.\u201d Some of these poems are in the form of epigrams, which appear for the first time in Frost\u2019s work. \u201cFire and Ice,\u201d for example, one of the better known epigrams, speculates on the means by which the world will end. Frost\u2019s most famous and, according to J. McBride Dabbs, most perfect lyric, \u201cStopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,\u201d is also included in this collection; conveying \u201cthe insistent whisper of death at the heart of life,\u201d the poem portrays a speaker who stops his sleigh in the midst of a snowy woods only to be called from the inviting gloom by the recollection of practical duties. Frost himself said of this poem that it is the kind he\u2019d like to print on one page followed with \u201cforty pages of footnotes.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWest-Running Brook (1928), Frost\u2019s fifth book of poems, is divided into six sections, one of which is taken up entirely by the title poem. This poem refers to a brook which perversely flows west instead of east to the Atlantic like all other brooks. A comparison is set up between the brook and the poem\u2019s speaker who trusts himself to go by \u201ccontraries\u201d; further rebellious elements exemplified by the brook give expression to an eccentric individualism, Frost\u2019s stoic theme of resistance and self-realization. Reviewing the collection in the New York Herald Tribune, Babette Deutsch wrote: \u201cThe courage that is bred by a dark sense of Fate, the tenderness that broods over mankind in all its blindness and absurdity, the vision that comes to rest as fully on kitchen smoke and lapsing snow as on mountains and stars\u2014these are his, and in his seemingly casual poetry, he quietly makes them ours.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\nA Further Range (1936), which earned Frost another Pulitzer Prize and was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, contains two groups of poems subtitled \u201cTaken Doubly\u201d and \u201cTaken Singly.\u201d In the first, and more interesting, of these groups, the poems are somewhat didactic, though there are humorous and satiric pieces as well. Included here is \u201cTwo Tramps in Mud Time,\u201d which opens with the story of two itinerant lumbermen who offer to cut the speaker\u2019s wood for pay; the poem then develops into a sermon on the relationship between work and play, vocation and avocation, preaching the necessity to unite them. Of the entire volume, William Rose Ben\u00e9t wrote, \u201cIt is better worth reading than nine-tenths of the books that will come your way this year. In a time when all kinds of insanity are assailing the nations it is good to listen to this quiet humor, even about a hen, a hornet, or Square Matthew. ... And if anybody should ask me why I still believe in my land, I have only to put this book in his hand and answer, \u2018Well-here is a man of my country.\u2019\u201d Most critics acknowledge that Frost\u2019s poetry in the 1940s and '50s grew more and more abstract, cryptic, and even sententious, so it is generally on the basis of his earlier work that he is judged. His politics and religious faith, hitherto informed by skepticism and local color, became more and more the guiding principles of his work. He had been, as Randall Jarrell points out, \u201ca very odd and very radical radical when young\u201d yet became \u201csometimes callously and unimaginatively conservative\u201d in his old age. He had become a public figure, and in the years before his death, much of his poetry was written from this stance.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nReviewing A Witness Tree (1942) in Books, Wilbert Snow noted a few poems \u201cwhich have a right to stand with the best things he has written\u201d: \u201cCome In,\u201d \u201cThe Silken Tent,\u201d and \u201cCarpe Diem\u201d especially. Yet Snow went on: \u201cSome of the poems here are little more than rhymed fancies; others lack the bullet-like unity of structure to be found in North of Boston.\u201d On the other hand, Stephen Vincent Benet felt that Frost had \u201cnever written any better poems than some of those in this book.\u201d Similarly, critics were let down by In the Clearing (1962). One wrote, \u201cAlthough this reviewer considers Robert Frost to be the foremost contemporary U.S. poet, he regretfully must state that most of the poems in this new volume are disappointing. ... [They] often are closer to jingles than to the memorable poetry we associate with his name.\u201d Another maintained that \u201cthe bulk of the book consists of poems of \u2018philosophic talk.\u2019 Whether you like them or not depends mostly on whether you share the \u2018philosophy.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nIndeed, many readers do share Frost\u2019s philosophy, and still others who do not nevertheless continue to find delight and significance in his large body of poetry. In October, 1963, President John F. Kennedy delivered a speech at the dedication of the Robert Frost Library in Amherst, Massachusetts. \u201cIn honoring Robert Frost,\u201d the President said, \u201cwe therefore can pay honor to the deepest source of our national strength. That strength takes many forms and the most obvious forms are not always the most significant. ... Our national strength matters; but the spirit which informs and controls our strength matters just as much. This was the special significance of Robert Frost.\u201d The poet would probably have been pleased by such recognition, for he had said once, in an interview with Harvey Breit: \u201cOne thing I care about, and wish young people could care about, is taking poetry as the first form of understanding. If poetry isn\u2019t understanding all, the whole world, then it isn\u2019t worth anything.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nFrost\u2019s poetry is revered to this day. When a previously unknown poem by Frost titled \u201cWar Thoughts at Home,\u201d was discovered and dated to 1918, it was subsequently published in the Fall 2006 issue of the Virginia Quarterly Review. The first edition Frost\u2019s Notebooks were published in 2009, and thousands of errors were corrected in the paperback edition years later. A critical edition of his Collected Prose was published in 2010 to broad critical acclaim. A multi-volume series of his Collected Letters is now in production, with the first volume appearing in 2014 and the second in 2016.\n\r\nRobert Frost continues to hold a unique and almost isolated position in American letters. \u201cThough his career fully spans the modern period and though it is impossible to speak of him as anything other than a modern poet,\u201d writes James M. Cox, \u201cit is difficult to place him in the main tradition of modern poetry.\u201d In a sense, Frost stands at the crossroads of 19th-century American poetry and modernism, for in his verse may be found the culmination of many 19th-century tendencies and traditions as well as parallels to the works of his 20th-century contemporaries. Taking his symbols from the public domain, Frost developed, as many critics note, an original, modern idiom and a sense of directness and economy that reflect the imagism of Ezra Pound and Amy Lowell. On the other hand, as Leonard Unger and William Van O\u2019Connor point out in Poems for Study, \u201cFrost\u2019s poetry, unlike that of such contemporaries as Eliot, Stevens, and the later Yeats, shows no marked departure from the poetic practices of the nineteenth century.\u201d Although he avoids traditional verse forms and only uses rhyme erratically, Frost is not an innovator and his technique is never experimental.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nFrost\u2019s theory of poetic composition ties him to both centuries. Like the 19th-century Romantic poets, he maintained that a poem is \u201cnever a put-up job. ... It begins as a lump in the throat, a sense of wrong, a homesickness, a loneliness. It is never a thought to begin with. It is at its best when it is a tantalizing vagueness.\u201d Yet, \u201cworking out his own version of the \u2018impersonal\u2019 view of art,\u201d as Hyatt H. Waggoner observed, Frost also upheld T.S. Eliot\u2019s idea that the man who suffers and the artist who creates are totally separate. In a 1932 letter to Sydney Cox, Frost explained his conception of poetry: \u201cThe objective idea is all I ever cared about. Most of my ideas occur in verse. ... To be too subjective with what an artist has managed to make objective is to come on him presumptuously and render ungraceful what he in pain of his life had faith he had made graceful.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nTo accomplish such objectivity and grace, Frost took up 19th-century tools and made them new. Lawrance Thompson has explained that, according to Frost, \u201cthe self-imposed restrictions of meter in form and of coherence in content\u201d work to a poet\u2019s advantage; they liberate him from the experimentalist\u2019s burden\u2014the perpetual search for new forms and alternative structures. Thus Frost, as he himself put it in \u201cThe Constant Symbol,\u201d wrote his verse regular; he never completely abandoned conventional metrical forms for free verse, as so many of his contemporaries were doing. At the same time, his adherence to meter, line length, and rhyme scheme was not an arbitrary choice. He maintained that \u201cthe freshness of a poem belongs absolutely to its not having been thought out and then set to verse as the verse in turn might be set to music.\u201d He believed, rather, that the poem\u2019s particular mood dictated or determined the poet\u2019s \u201cfirst commitment to metre and length of line.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nCritics frequently point out that Frost complicated his problem and enriched his style by setting traditional meters against the natural rhythms of speech. Drawing his language primarily from the vernacular, he avoided artificial poetic diction by employing the accent of a soft-spoken New Englander. In The Function of Criticism, Yvor Winters faulted Frost for his \u201cendeavor to make his style approximate as closely as possible the style of conversation.\u201d But what Frost achieved in his poetry was much more complex than a mere imitation of the New England farmer idiom. He wanted to restore to literature the \u201csentence sounds that underlie the words,\u201d the \u201cvocal gesture\u201d that enhances meaning. That is, he felt the poet\u2019s ear must be sensitive to the voice in order to capture with the written word the significance of sound in the spoken word. \u201cThe Death of the Hired Man,\u201d for instance, consists almost entirely of dialogue between Mary and Warren, her farmer-husband, but critics have observed that in this poem Frost takes the prosaic patterns of their speech and makes them lyrical. To Ezra Pound \u201cThe Death of the Hired Man\u201d represented Frost at his best\u2014when he \u201cdared to write ... in the natural speech of New England; in natural spoken speech, which is very different from the \u2018natural\u2019 speech of the newspapers, and of many professors.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nFrost\u2019s use of New England dialect is only one aspect of his often discussed regionalism. Within New England, his particular focus was on New Hampshire, which he called \u201cone of the two best states in the Union,\u201d the other being Vermont. In an essay entitled \u201cRobert Frost and New England: A Revaluation,\u201d W.G. O\u2019Donnell noted how from the start, in A Boy\u2019s Will, \u201cFrost had already decided to give his writing a local habitation and a New England name, to root his art in the soil that he had worked with his own hands.\u201d Reviewing North of Boston in the New Republic, Amy Lowell wrote, \u201cNot only is his work New England in subject, it is so in technique. ... Mr. Frost has reproduced both people and scenery with a vividness which is extraordinary.\u201d Many other critics have lauded Frost\u2019s ability to realistically evoke the New England landscape; they point out that one can visualize an orchard in \u201cAfter Apple-Picking\u201d or imagine spring in a farmyard in \u201cTwo Tramps in Mud Time.\u201d In this \u201cability to portray the local truth in nature,\u201d O\u2019Donnell claims, Frost has no peer. The same ability prompted Pound to declare, \u201cI know more of farm life than I did before I had read his poems. That means I know more of \u2018Life.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nFrost\u2019s regionalism, critics remark, is in his realism, not in politics; he creates no picture of regional unity or sense of community. In The Continuity of American Poetry, Roy Harvey Pearce describes Frost\u2019s protagonists as individuals who are constantly forced to confront their individualism as such and to reject the modern world in order to retain their identity. Frost\u2019s use of nature is not only similar but closely tied to this regionalism. He stays as clear of religion and mysticism as he does of politics. What he finds in nature is sensuous pleasure; he is also sensitive to the earth\u2019s fertility and to man\u2019s relationship to the soil. To critic M.L. Rosenthal, Frost\u2019s pastoral quality, his \u201clyrical and realistic repossession of the rural and \u2018natural,\u2019\u201d is the staple of his reputation.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nYet, just as Frost is aware of the distances between one man and another, so he is also always aware of the distinction, the ultimate separateness, of nature and man. Marion Montgomery has explained, \u201cHis attitude toward nature is one of armed and amicable truce and mutual respect interspersed with crossings of the boundaries\u201d between individual man and natural forces. Below the surface of Frost\u2019s poems are dreadful implications, what Rosenthal calls his \u201cshocked sense of the helpless cruelty of things.\u201d This natural cruelty is at work in \u201cDesign\u201d and in \u201cOnce by the Pacific.\u201d The ominous tone of these two poems prompted Rosenthal\u2019s further comment: \u201cAt his most powerful Frost is as staggered by \u2018the horror\u2019 as Eliot and approaches the hysterical edge of sensibility in a comparable way. ... His is still the modern mind in search of its own meaning.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe austere and tragic view of life that emerges in so many of Frost\u2019s poems is modulated by his metaphysical use of detail. As Frost portrays him, man might be alone in an ultimately indifferent universe, but he may nevertheless look to the natural world for metaphors of his own condition. Thus, in his search for meaning in the modern world, Frost focuses on those moments when the seen and the unseen, the tangible and the spiritual intersect. John T. Napier calls this Frost\u2019s ability \u201cto find the ordinary a matrix for the extraordinary.\u201d In this respect, he is often compared with Emily Dickinson and Ralph Waldo Emerson, in whose poetry, too, a simple fact, object, person, or event will be transfigured and take on greater mystery or significance. The poem \u201cBirches\u201d\u00a0is an example: it contains the image of slender trees bent to the ground temporarily by a boy\u2019s swinging on them or permanently by an ice-storm. But as the poem unfolds, it becomes clear that the speaker is concerned not only with child\u2019s play and natural phenomena, but also with the point at which physical and spiritual reality merge.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nSuch symbolic import of mundane facts informs many of Frost\u2019s poems, and in \u201cEducation by Poetry\u201d he explained: \u201cPoetry begins in trivial metaphors, pretty metaphors, \u2018grace\u2019 metaphors, and goes on to the profoundest thinking that we have. Poetry provides the one permissible way of saying one thing and meaning another. ... Unless you are at home in the metaphor, unless you have had your proper poetical education in the metaphor, you are not safe anywhere.\u201d\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
