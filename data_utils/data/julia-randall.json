She studied English at Bennington College and medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine before earning an MA from the Johns Hopkins Writing Seminars. She published seven collections of poetry in her lifetime: The Solstice Tree (1952), Mimic August (1960), The Puritan Carpenter (1965), Adam\u2019s Dream (1969), The Farewells (1981), Moving in Memory (1987), and The Path to Fairview (1992).\r\nRandall\u2019s poetry is often described in terms of its technical prowess and formal assurance. Critic Meg Schoerke alleged that \u201cRandall succeeds in being both traditional and radically antitraditional in her poetry,\u201d and poet Eleanor Wilner has described Randall\u2019s form as \u201cfree verse [that] has a long training of the ear behind it, and her cadenced, contrapuntal music is all the livelier for being free to play without fixed constraints.\u201d\nAn instructor at Goucher College, Towson University, and the Peabody Conservatory, among other places, Randall retired from Hollins College in 1973 and moved to Glen Arm, Maryland. In Maryland, she was an environmental activist working for the protection of the Long Green Valley. She moved to Vermont in 1987, where she lived until her death.  \ufeff\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., New England"]}}
