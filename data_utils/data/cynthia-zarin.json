She earned a BA at Harvard and an MFA Columbia University, and has taught at Yale. Poet-in-residence at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, she has also been a long-time contributor to the New Yorker and is resident writer for BalletCollective, which has staged two ballets based on her poems. Known for her exacting language, Ernest Hilbert noted that Zarin \u201ccomposes formal, meditative poems that remind the reader of Elizabeth Bishop and Richard Wilbur.\u201d Her books of poetry include The Swordfish Tooth (1989), Fire Lyric (1993), The Watercourse (2002), which won the Los Angeles Book Award, and The Ada Poems (2010), a series of poems based on Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s classic novel Ada, or Ardor: A Family Chronicle. Using \u201cAda\u201d as the speaker for the poems, Zarin riffs on impossible love in new ways. Reviewing the book in Gulf Coast, Sarah Schweig noted that Ada \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily drive the invention of these poems, but gives the speaker\u2019s own tale of desire and loss a common literary thread that refers to another story of impossible love. The poems, inventive in quieter ways, are beautifully constructed\u2026 the ruse of Ada allows the \u2018I\u2019 to say things that perhaps it couldn\u2019t say, to speak of an otherwise unutterable longing, an irreversible loss of love.\u201d Zarin's recent work includes the essay collection An Enlarged Heart: A Personal History (2013) and the poetry collection Orbit (2017).\r\n\u00a0\r\nZarin\u2019s poetry for adults has been praised for its slightly offbeat perspective on mundane, typically overlooked topics, and her picture books for children, including Rose and Sebastian (1997) and What Do You See When You Shut Your Eyes? (1998), encourage her preschool audience to look at things from a fresh perspective. What Do You See When You Shut Your Eyes? features rhyming questions and answers that encourage children to use their five senses and imaginations to participate in the fun. Zarin's text \u201cexpresses a poet's sensibility,\u201d asserted a reviewer for Publishers Weekly, \u201can ability to observe, a sense of the absurd, an affection for the everyday, an eye for juxtaposition.\u201d Zarin\u2019s other books for children include Wallace Hoskins, the Boy Who Grew Down (1999), Albert, the Dog Who Liked to Ride in Taxis (2003), and Saints Among the Animals (2006).\r\n\u00a0\r\nZarin has received numerous awards for her work, including fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation. She is married to the art dealer Joseph Goddu and currently lives in New York City.\r\n\u00a0\n\r\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {}}
