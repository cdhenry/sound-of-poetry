He earned an MA in linguistics at City College of New York, where he studied the work of Gertrude Stein, a poet whose avant-garde aesthetic and interest in art would influence his own work. A poet, artist, and critic, Antin is associated with a group of artists and poets who brought new definitions and ambitions to poetry in the early 1970s.\u00a0He taught in the Department of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego for over 25 years. He received numerous honors and awards for his work, including fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities. In 1984, he received the PEN Los Angeles Award for Poetry.\nAntin\u2019s work in postmodern forms of art and writing led him, in the 1970s, to \u201ctalk poems,\u201d a hybrid of criticism, poetry, and storytelling that involves Antin discoursing freely on a subject in front of an audience. Some of Antin\u2019s most famous works, including Talking (1972), Talking at the Boundaries (1976), and What it Means to be Avant-Garde (1993) were composed this way. Antin described his talk poems as \u201cimprovised talk pieces, pieces I go to some particular place to create\u2014in public, as improvisations. I go to a particular place with something in mind but no clear way of saying it, and in the place I come to I try to find some way to deal with what I am interested in, in a way that is meaningful to both the audience and myself. I tape record the pieces, and if I was successful I have something I can transcribe, that may be worth publishing. If it is, I publish it; if not, I forget it. So the \u2018talk poems\u2019 are more or less adapted notations of performances, done somewhere. I\u2019ve been doing improvised \u2018talk poems\u2019 since 1972. My first book to include a \u2018talk poem\u2019 was Talking.\u201d\nOf his early poetry\u2019s connection to science, Antin told Contemporary Authors, \u201cMy background in linguistics and my background in science reflect my interest in the human significance of language structures \u2026 Definitions (1967) reflects my interest in the language of science and its implications, Code of Flag Behavior (1968), my interest in the pop vernacular and clich\u00e9. The term \u2018found poetry\u2019 with its suggestion of the \u2018trouvaille\u2019 and estheticism of junk sculpture was always far from my concerns. I am interested in the lethal implications of socially debased language, at least I was at the time of Code of Flag Behavior, which has something in common with the pop Art strategies of Warhol, Lichtenstein and Wesselman. Contrary to the beliefs of many poets, all language is \u2018found,\u2019 but some language is not only found, but second and third and hundredth hand.\u201d\nAs a critic, Antin was\u00a0instrumental in providing new insights into artists such as Andy Warhol, Andy Katz, Sol Lewitt, and Carl Andre. His book of essays, Radical Coherence: Selected Essays on Art and Literature (2011), collects over 40 years of looking at\u00a0and thinking about\u00a0innovative art. Douglas Messerli described Antin\u2019s idiosyncratic, lucid style: \u201cReading Antin on art is as if one were accompanying a lively friend or uncle on trips to the museums and galleries throughout the country over a period of several years, the only way one can truly come to know and appreciate art.\u201d Radical Coherency also includes Antin\u2019s essays on modern and postmodern literature, especially poetry. Critic Marjorie Perloff told the San Diego Reader, \u201cDavid Antin\u2019s early essays were uniquely prescient, and many of them have become classics. Meanwhile, the \u2018talk pieces\u2019 included here, most of them dating from the \u201980s and early \u201990s, uncannily anticipate the hybrid texts of conceptual writing today, taking up, as they do, complex philosophical issues that can be addressed but never resolved.\u201d\nAntin died in San Diego, California in 2016.\n", "attrs": {"School/Period:": ["New York School (2nd Generation)"]}}
