After studying at the University of Missouri in Columbia and Washington University in St. Louis, he earned a BA from the University of Iowa in 1938. He then moved to New Orleans, one of two places where he was for the rest of his life to feel at home. The production of his first two Broadway plays, The Glass Menagerie (1945) and A Streetcar Named Desire (1947), secured his place, along with Eugene O\u2019Neill and Arthur Miller, as one of America\u2019s major playwrights of the 20th century. Critics, playgoers, and fellow dramatists recognized in Williams a poetic innovator who, refusing to be confined in what Stark Young in the New Republic called \u201cthe usual sterilities of our playwriting patterns,\u201d pushed drama into new fields, stretched the limits of the individual play and became one of the founders of the so-called \u201cNew Drama.\u201d Praising The Glass Menagerie \u201cas a revelation of what superb theater could be,\u201d Brooks Atkinson in Broadway asserted that \u201cWilliams\u2019s remembrance of things past gave the theater distinction as a literary medium.\u201d 20 years later, Joanne Stang wrote in the New York Times that \u201cthe American theater, indeed theater everywhere, has never been the same\u201d since the premier of The Glass Menagerie. Four decades after that first play, C.W.E. Bigsby in A Critical Introduction to Twentieth-Century American Drama termed it \u201cone of the best works to have come out of the American theater.\u201d A Streetcar Named Desire became only the second play in history to win both the Pulitzer Prize and the New York Drama Critics Circle Award. Eric Bentley, in What Is Theatre?, called it the \u201cmaster-drama of the generation.\u201d \u201cThe inevitability of a great work of art,\u201d T.E. Kalem stated in Albert J. Devlin\u2019s Conversations with Tennessee Williams, \u201cis that you cannot imagine the time when it didn\u2019t exist. You can\u2019t imagine a time when Streetcar didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\r\nMore clearly than with most authors, the facts of Williams\u2019s life reveal the origins of the material he crafted into his best works. The Mississippi in which Thomas Lanier Williams was born was in many ways a world that no longer exists, \u201ca dark, wide, open world that you can breathe in,\u201d as Williams nostalgically described it in Harry Rasky\u2019s Tennessee Williams: A Portrait in Laughter and Lamentation. The predominantly rural state was dotted with towns such as Columbus, Canton, and Clarksdale, in which he spent his first seven years with his mother, his sister, Rose, and his maternal grandmother and grandfather, an Episcopal rector. A sickly child, Tom was pampered by doting elders. In 1918, his father, a traveling salesman who had often been absent\u2014perhaps, like his stage counterpart in The Glass Menagerie, \u201cin love with long distances\u201d\u2014moved the family to St. Louis. Something of the trauma they experienced is dramatized in the 1945 play. The contrast between leisurely small-town past and northern big-city present, between protective grandparents and the hard-drinking, gambling father with little patience for the sensitive son he saw as a \u201csissy,\u201d seriously affected both children. While Rose retreated into her own mind until finally beyond the reach even of her loving brother, Tom made use of that adversity. St. Louis remained for him \u201ca city I loathe,\u201d but the South, despite his portrayal of its grotesque aspects, proved a rich source to which he returned literally and imaginatively for comfort and inspiration. That background, his queerness, and his relationships\u2014painful and joyous\u2014with members of his family, were the strongest personal factors shaping Williams\u2019s dramas.\n\r\nDuring the St. Louis years, Williams found an imaginative release from unpleasant reality in writing essays, stories, poems, and plays. A recurrent motif in Williams\u2019s plays involves flight and the fugitive, who, Lord Byron insists in Camino Real: A Play (1953) must keep moving, and his flight from St. Louis initiated a nomadic life of brief stays in a variety of places. Williams fled not only uncongenial atmospheres but a turbulent family situation that had culminated in a decision for Rose to have a prefrontal lobotomy in an effort to alleviate her increasing psychological problems. (Williams\u2019s works often include absentee fathers, enduring\u2014if aggravating\u2014mothers, and dependent relatives; and the memory of Rose appears in some character, situation, symbol or motif in almost every work after 1938.) He fled as well some part of himself, for he had created a new persona\u2014Tennessee Williams the playwright\u2014who shared the same body as the proper young gentleman named Thomas with whom Tennessee would always be to some degree at odds.\n\r\nIn 1940, Williams\u2019s Battle of Angels (1940) was staged by the Theatre Guild in an ill-fated production marred as much by faulty smudge pots in the lynching scene as by Boston censorship. Despite the abrupt out-of-town closing of the play, Williams was now known and admired by powerful theater people. During the next two decades, his most productive period, one play succeeded another, each of them permanent entries in the history of modern theater: The Glass Menagerie (1945), A Streetcar Named Desire (1947), Summer and Smoke (1948), The Rose Tattoo (1951), Camino Real (1953), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955), Orpheus Descending (1957), Suddenly Last Summer (1958), Sweet Bird of Youth (1959), and The Night of the Iguana (1961). Despite increasingly adverse criticism, Williams continued his work for the theater for two more decades, during which he wrote more than a dozen additional plays containing evidence of his virtues as a poetic realist. In the course of his long career, he also produced three volumes of short stories, many of them as studies for subsequent dramas; two novels; two volumes of poetry; his memoirs; and essays on his life and craft. His dramas made that rare transition from legitimate stage to movies and television, from intellectual acceptance to popular acceptance. Before his death in 1983, he had become the best-known living dramatist; his plays had been translated and performed in many foreign countries, and his name and work had become known even to people who had never seen a production of any of his plays. The persona named Tennessee Williams had achieved the status of a myth.\n\r\nWilliams drew from the experiences of his persona. He saw himself as a shy, sensitive, gifted man trapped in a world where \u201cmendacity\u201d replaced communication, brute violence replaced love, and loneliness was, all too often, the standard human condition. These tensions \u201cat the core of his creation\u201d were identified by Harold Clurman in his introduction to Tennessee Williams: Eight Plays as a terror at what Williams saw in himself and in America, a terror that he must \u201cexorcise\u201d with \u201chis poetic vision.\u201d In an interview collected in Conversations with Tennessee Williams, Williams identified his main theme as a defense of the Old South attitude\u2014\u201delegance, a love of the beautiful, a romantic attitude toward life\u201d\u2014and \u201ca violent protest against those things that defeat it.\u201d An idealist aware of what he called in a Conversations interview \u201cthe merciless harshness of America\u2019s success-oriented society,\u201d he was, ironically, naturalistic as well, conscious of the inaccessibility of that for which he yearned. Early on, he developed, according to John Gassner in Theatre at the Crossroads: Plays and Playwrights of the Mid-Century American Stage, \u201ca precise naturalism\u201d and continued to work toward a \u201cfusion of naturalistic detail with symbolism and poetic sensibility rare in American playwriting.\u201d The result was a unique romanticism, as Kenneth Tynan observed in Curtains, \u201cwhich is not pale or scented but earthy and robust, the product of a mind vitally infected with the rhythms of human speech.\u201d\n\r\nWilliams\u2019s characters endeavor to embrace the ideal, to advance and not \u201chold back with the brutes,\u201d a struggle no less valiant for being vain. In A Streetcar Named Desire,\u00a0Blanche\u2019s idealization of life at Belle Reve, the DuBois plantation, cannot protect her once, in the words of the brutish Stanley Kowalski, she has come \u201cdown off them columns\u201d into the \u201cbroken world,\u201d the world of sexual desire. Since every human, as Val Xavier observes in Orpheus Descending, is sentenced \u201cto solitary confinement inside our own lonely skins for as long as we live on earth,\u201d the only hope is to try to communicate, to love, and to live\u2014even beyond despair, as The Night of the Iguana teaches. The attempt to communicate often takes the form of sex (and Williams has been accused of obsession with that aspect of human existence), but at other times it becomes a willingness to show compassion, as when in The Night of the Iguana Hannah Jelkes accepts the neuroses of her fellow creatures and when in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Big Daddy understands, as his son Brick cannot, the attachment between Brick and Skipper. In his preface to Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Williams might have been describing his characters\u2019 condition when he spoke of \u201cthe outcry of prisoner to prisoner from the cell in solitary where each is confined for the duration of his life.\u201d \u201cThe marvel is,\u201d as Tynan stated, that Williams\u2019s \u201cabnormal\u201d view of life, \u201cheightened and spotlighted and slashed with bogey shadows,\u201d can be made to touch his audience\u2019s more normal views, thus achieving that \u201cmiracle of communication\u201d Williams believed to be almost impossible.\n\r\nSome of his contemporaries\u2014Arthur Miller, notably\u2014responded to the modern condition with social protest, but Williams, after a few early attempts at that genre, chose another approach. Williams insisted in a Conversations interview that he wrote about the South not as a sociologist: \u201cWhat I am writing about is human nature. ... Human relations are terrifyingly ambiguous.\u201d Williams chose to present characters full of uncertainties, mysteries, and doubts. Yet Arthur Miller himself wrote in The Theatre Essays of Tennessee Williams that although Williams might not portray social reality, \u201cthe intensity with which he feels whatever he does feel is so deep, is so great\u201d that his audiences glimpse another kind of reality, \u201cthe reality in the spirit.\u201d Clurman likewise argued that though Williams was no \u201cpropagandist,\u201d social commentary is \u201cinherent in his portraiture.\u201d The inner torment and disintegration of a character like Blanche in A Streetcar Named Desire thus symbolize the lost South from which she comes and with which she is inseparably entwined. It was to that lost world and the unpleasant one that succeeded it that Williams turned for the majority of his settings and material.\n\r\nLike that of most Southern writers, Williams\u2019s work exhibits an abiding concern with time and place and how they affect men and women. \u201cThe play is memory,\u201d Tom proclaims in The Glass Menagerie; and Williams\u2019s characters are haunted by a past that they have difficulty accepting or that they valiantly endeavor to transform into myth. Interested in yesterday or tomorrow rather than in today, painfully conscious of the physical and emotional scars the years inflict, they have a static, dreamlike quality, and the result, Tynan observed, is \u201cthe drama of mood.\u201d The Mississippi towns of his childhood continued to haunt Williams\u2019s imagination throughout his career, but New Orleans offered him, he told Robert Rice in the 1958 New York Post interviews, a new freedom: \u201cThe shock of it against the Puritanism of my nature has given me a subject, a theme, which I have never ceased exploiting.\u201d (That shabby but charming city became the setting for several stories and one-act plays, and A Streetcar Named Desire derives much of its distinction from French Quarter ambience and attitudes; as Stella informs Blanche, \u201cNew Orleans isn\u2019t like other cities,\u201d a view reinforced by Williams\u2019s 1977 portrait of the place in Vieux Carre.) Atkinson observed, \u201cOnly a writer who had survived in the lower depths of a sultry Southern city could know the characters as intimately as Williams did and be so thoroughly steeped in the aimless sprawl of the neighborhood life.\u201d\n\r\nWilliams\u2019s South provided not only settings but other characteristics of his work\u2014romanticism; a myth of an Arcadian existence now disappeared; a distinctive way of looking at life, including both an inbred Calvinistic belief in the reality of evil eternally at war with good, and what Bentley called a \u201cpeculiar combination of the comic and the pathetic.\u201d The South also inspired Williams\u2019s fascination with violence, his drawing upon regional character types, and his skill in recording Southern language\u2014eloquent, flowery, sometimes bombastic. Moreover, Southern history, particularly the US Civil War and the devastating Reconstruction period, imprinted on Williams, as on such major Southern fiction writers as William Faulkner, Flannery O\u2019Connor, and Walker Percy, a profound sense of separation and alienation. Williams, as Thomas E. Porter declared in Myth and Modern American Drama, explored \u201cthe mind of the Southerner caught between an idyllic past and an undesirable present,\u201d commemorating the death of a myth even as he continued to examine it. \u201cHis broken figures appeal,\u201d Bigsby asserted, \u201cbecause they are victims of history\u2014the lies of the old South no longer being able to sustain the individual in a world whose pragmatics have no place for the fragile spirit.\u201d In a Conversations interview the playwright commented that \u201cthe South once had a way of life that I am just old enough to remember\u2014a culture that had grace, elegance. ... I write out of regret for that.\u201d\n\r\nWilliams\u2019s plays are peopled with a large cast that J.L. Styan termed, in Modern Drama in Theory and Practice, \u201cGarrulous Grotesques\u201d; these figures include \u201cuntouchables whom he touches with frankness and mercy,\u201d according to Tynan. They bear the stamp of their place of origin and speak a \u201chumorous, colorful, graphic\u201d language, which Williams in a Conversations interview called the \u201cmad music of my characters.\u201d \u201cHave you ever known a Southerner who wasn\u2019t long-winded?\u201d he asked; \u201cI mean, a Southerner not afflicted with terminal asthma.\u201d Among that cast are the romantics who, however suspect their own virtues may be, act out of belief in and commitment to what Faulkner called the \u201cold verities and truths of the heart.\u201d They include fallen aristocrats hounded, Gerald Weales observed in American Drama since World War II, \u201cby poverty, by age, by frustration,\u201d or, as Bigsby called them in his 1985 study, \u201cmartyrs for a world which has already slipped away unmourned\u201d; fading Southern belles such as Amanda Wingate and Blanche DuBois; slightly deranged women, such as Aunt Rose Comfort in an early one-act play and in the film \u201cBaby Doll\u201d; dictatorial patriarchs such as Big Daddy; and the outcasts (or \u201cfugitive kind,\u201d the playwright\u2019s term later employed as the title of a 1960 motion picture). Many of these characters tend to recreate the scene in which they find themselves\u2014Laura with her glass animals shutting out the alley where cats are brutalized, Blanche trying to subdue the ugliness of the Kowalski apartment with a paper lantern; in their dialogue they frequently poeticize and melodramatize their situations, thereby surrounding themselves with protective illusion, which in later plays becomes \u201cmendacity.\u201d For also inhabiting that dramatic world are more powerful individuals, amoral representatives of the new Southern order, Jabe Torrance in Battle of Angels, Gooper and Mae in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Boss Finley in Sweet Bird of Youth, enemies of the romantic impulse and as destructive and virtueless as Faulkner\u2019s Snopes clan. Southern though all these characters are, they are not mere regional portraits, for through Williams\u2019s dramatization of them and their dilemmas and through the audience\u2019s empathy, the characters become everyman and everywoman.\n\r\nAlthough traumatic experiences plagued his life, Williams was able to press \u201cthe nettle of neurosis\u201d to his heart and produce art, as Gassner observed. Williams\u2019s family problems, his alienation from the social norm resulting from his queerness, his sense of being a romantic in an unromantic, postwar world, and his sensitive reaction when a production proved less than successful all contributed significantly to his work. Through the years he suffered from a variety of ailments, some serious, some surely imaginary, and at certain periods he overindulged in alcohol and prescription drugs. Despite these circumstances, he continued to write with a determination that verged at times almost on desperation, even as his new plays elicited progressively more hostile reviews from critics.\n\r\nAn outgrowth of this suffering is the character type \u201cthe fugitive kind,\u201d the wanderer who lives outside the pale of society, excluded by his sensitivity, artistic bent, or sexual proclivity from the world of \u201cnormal\u201d human beings. Like Faulkner, Williams was troubled by the exclusivity of any society that shuts out certain segments because they are different. First manifested in Val of Battle of Angels (later rewritten as Orpheus Descending) and then in the character of Tom, the struggling poet of The Glass Menagerie and his shy, withdrawn sister, the fugitive kind appears in varying guises in subsequent plays, including Blanche DuBois, Alma Winemiller (Summer and Smoke), Kilroy (Camino Real), and Hannah and Shannon (The Night of the Iguana). Each is unique but they share common characteristics, which Weales summed up as physical or mental illness, a preoccupation with sex, and a \u201ccombination of sensitivity and imagination with corruption.\u201d Their abnormality suggests, the critic argued, that the dramatist views the norm of society as being faulty itself. Even characters within the \u201cnorm\u201d (Stanley Kowalski, for example) are often identified with strong sexual drives. Like D.H. Lawrence, Williams indulged in a kind of phallic romanticism, attributing sexual potency to members of the unintelligent lower classes and sterility to aristocrats. Despite his romanticism, however, Williams\u2019s view of humanity was too realistic for him to accept such pat categories. \u201cIf you write a character that isn\u2019t ambiguous,\u201d Williams said in a Conversations interview, \u201cyou are writing a false character, not a true one.\u201d Though he shared Lawrence\u2019s view that one should not suppress sexual impulses, Williams recognized that such impulses are at odds with the romantic desire to transcend and that they often lead to suffering like that endured by Blanche DuBois. Those fugitive characters who are destroyed, Bigsby remarked, often perish \u201cbecause they offer love in a world characterized by impotence and sterility.\u201d Thus phallic potency may represent a positive force in a character such as Val or a destructive force in one like Stanley Kowalski; but even in A Streetcar Named Desire Williams acknowledges that the life force, represented by Stella\u2019s baby, is positive. There are, as Weales pointed out, two divisions in the sexual activity Williams dramatizes: \u201cdesperation sex,\u201d in which characters such as Val and Blanche \u201cmake contact with another only tentatively, momentarily\u201d in order to communicate; and the \u201cconsolation and comfort\u201d sex that briefly fulfills Lady in Orpheus Descending and saves Serafina in The Rose Tattoo. There is, surely, a third kind, sex as a weapon, wielded by those like Stanley; this kind of sex is to be feared, for it is often associated with the violence prevalent in Williams\u2019s dramas.\n\r\nBeginning with Battle of Angels, two opposing camps have existed among Williams\u2019s critics, and his detractors sometimes have objected most strenuously to the innovations his supporters deemed virtues. His strongest advocates among established drama critics, notably Stark Young, Brooks Atkinson, John Gassner, and Walter Kerr, praised him for realistic clarity; compassion and a strong moral sense; unforgettable characters, especially women, based on his keen perception of human nature; dialogue at once credible and poetic; and a pervasive sense of humor that distinguished him from O\u2019Neill and Miller.\n\r\nNot surprisingly, it was from the conservative establishment that most of the adverse criticism came. Obviously appalled by this \u201cupstart crow,\u201d George Jean Nathan, dean of theater commentators when Williams made his revolutionary entrance onto the scene, sounded notes often to be repeated. In The Theatre Book of the Year, 1947-1948, he faulted Williams\u2019s early triumphs for \u201cmistiness of ideology ... questionable symbolism ... debatable character drawing ... adolescent point of view ... theatrical fabrication,\u201d obsession with sex, fallen women, and \u201cthe deranged Dixie damsel.\u201d Nathan saw Williams as a melodramatist whose attempts at tragedy were as ludicrous as \u201ca threnody on a zither.\u201d Subsequent detractors\u2014notably Richard Gilman, Robert Brustein, Clive Barnes, and John Simon\u2014taxed the playwright for theatricality, repetition, lack of judgment and control, excessive moralizing and philosophizing, and conformity to the demands of the ticket-buying public. His plays, they variously argued, lacked unity of effect, clarity of intention, social content, and variety; these critics saw the plays as burdened with excessive symbolism, violence, sexuality, and attention to the sordid, grotesque elements of life. Additionally, certain commentators charged that Elia Kazan, the director of the early masterpieces, virtually rewrote A Streetcar Named Desire and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. A particular kind of negative criticism, often intensely emotional, seemed to dominate evaluations of the plays produced in the last 20 years of Williams\u2019s life.\n\r\nMost critics, even his detractors, have praised the dramatist\u2019s skillful creation of dialogue. Bentley asserted that \u201cno one in the English-speaking theater\u201d created better dialogue, that Williams\u2019s plays were really \u201cwritten\u2014that is to say, set down in living language.\u201d Ruby Cohn stated in Dialogue in American Drama that Williams gave to American theater \u201ca new vocabulary and rhythm,\u201d and Clurman concluded, \u201cNo one in the theater has written more melodiously. Without the least artificial flourish, his writing takes flight from the naturalistic to the poetic.\u201d Even Mary McCarthy, no ardent fan, stated in Theatre Chronicles: 1937-1962 that Williams was the only American realist other than Paddy Chayevsky with an ear for dialogue, knew speech patterns, and really heard his characters. There were, of course, objections to Williams\u2019s lyrical dialogue, different as it is from the dialogue of O\u2019Neill, Miller, or any other major American playwright. Bentley admitted to finding his \u201cfake poeticizing\u201d troublesome at times, while Bigsby insisted that Williams was at his best only when he restrained \u201cover-poetic language\u201d and symbolism with \u201can imagination which if melodramatic is also capable of fine control.\u201d However, those long poetic speeches or \u201carias\u201d in plays of the first 25 years of his career became a hallmark of the dramatist\u2019s work.\n\r\nAnother major area of contention among commentators has been Williams\u2019s use of symbols, which he called in a Conversations interview \u201cthe natural language of drama.\u201d Laura\u2019s glass animals, the paper lantern and cathedral bells in A Streetcar Named Desire, the legless birds of Orpheus Descending, and the iguana in The Night of the Iguana, to name only a few, are integral to the plays in which they appear. Cohn commented on Williams\u2019s extensive use of animal images in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof to symbolize the fact that all the Pollitts, \u201cgrasping, screeching, devouring,\u201d are \u201cgreedily alive.\u201d In that play, Big Daddy\u2019s malignancy effectively represents the corruption in the family and in the larger society to which the characters belong. However, Weales objected that Williams, like The Glass Menagerie\u2019s Tom, had \u201ca poet\u2019s weakness for symbols,\u201d which can get out of hand; he argued that in Suddenly Last Summer, Violet Venable\u2019s garden does not grow out of the situation and enrich the play. Sometimes, Cohn observed, a certain weakness of symbolism \u201cis built into the fabric of the drama.\u201d\n\r\nCritics favorable to Williams have agreed that one of his virtues lay in his characterization. Those \u201csuperbly actable parts,\u201d Atkinson stated, derived from his ability to find \u201cextraordinary spiritual significance in ordinary people.\u201d Cohn admired Williams\u2019s \u201cSouthern grotesques\u201d and his knack for giving them \u201cdignity,\u201d although some critics have been put off by the excessive number of such grotesques, which contributed, they argued, to a distorted view of reality. Commentators have generally concurred in their praise of Williams\u2019s talent in creating credible female roles. \u201cNo one in American drama has written more intuitively of women,\u201d Clurman asserted; Gassner spoke of Williams\u2019s \u201cuncanny familiarity with the flutterings of the female heart.\u201d Kerr in The Theatre in Spite of Itself expressed wonder at such roles as that of Hannah in The Night of the Iguana, \u201ca portrait which owes nothing to calipers, or to any kind of tooling; it is all surprise and presence, anticipated intimacy. It is found gold, not a borrowing against known reserves.\u201d Surveying the \u201csteamy zoo\u201d of Williams\u2019s characters with their violence, despair, and aberrations, Stang commended the author for the \u201cpoetry and compassion that comprise his great gift.\u201d Compassion is the key word in all tributes to Williams\u2019s characterization. It is an acknowledgment of the playwright\u2019s uncanny talent for making audiences and readers empathize with his people, however grotesque, bizarre, or even sordid they may seem on the surface.\n\r\nAlthough they have granted him compassion, some of his detractors maintain that Williams does not exhibit a clear philosophy of life, and they have found unacceptable the ambiguity in judging human flaws and frailties that is one of his most distinctive qualities. For them, one difficulty stems from the playwright\u2019s recognition of and insistence on portraying the ambiguity of human activities and relationships. Moral, even puritanical, though he might be, Williams never seems ready to condemn any action other than \u201cdeliberate cruelty,\u201d and even that is sometimes portrayed as resulting from extenuating circumstances.\n\r\nIn terms of dramatic technique, those who acknowledge his genius disagree as to where it has been best expressed. For Jerold Phillips, writing in the Dictionary of Literary Biography Documentary Series, Williams\u2019s major contribution lay in turning from the Ibsenesque social problem plays to \u201cStrindberg-like explorations of what goes on underneath the skin,\u201d thereby freeing American theater from \u201cthe hold of the so-called well-made play.\u201d For Allan Lewis in American Plays and Playwrights of the Contemporary Theatre, he was a \u201cbrilliant inventor of emotionally intense scenes\u201d whose \u201cgreatest gift [lay] in suggesting ideas through emotional relations.\u201d His preeminence among dramatists in the United States, Jean Gould wrote in Modern American Playwrights, resulted from a combination of poetic sensitivity, theatricality, and \u201cthe dedication of the artist.\u201d If, from the beginning of his career, there were detractors who charged Williams with overuse of melodramatic, grotesque, and violent elements that produced a distorted view of reality, Kerr, in The Theatre in Spite of Itself, termed him \u201ca man unafraid of melodrama, and a man who handles it with extraordinary candor and deftness.\u201d\n\r\nOther commentators have been offended by what Bentley termed Williams\u2019s \u201cexploitation of the obscene\u201d: his choice of characters\u2014outcasts, alcoholics, the violent and deranged and sexually abnormal\u2014and of subject matter\u2014incest, castration, and cannibalism. Williams justified the \u201csordid\u201d elements of his work in a Conversations interview when he asserted that \u201cwe must depict the awfulness of the world we live in, but we must do it with a kind of aesthetic\u201d to avoid producing mere horror.\n\r\nAnother negative aspect of Williams\u2019s art, some critics argued, was his theatricality. Gassner asserted in Directions in Modern Theatre and Drama that Kazan, the director, avoided flashy stage effects called for in Williams\u2019s text of The Glass Menagerie, but that in some plays Kazan collaborated with the playwright to exaggerate these effects, especially in the expressionistic and allegorical drama Camino Real. In a Conversations interview, Williams addressed this charge, particularly as it involved Kazan, by asserting, \u201cMy cornpone melodrama is all my own. I want excitement in the theater. ... I have a tendency toward romanticism and a taste for the theatrical.\u201d\n\r\nLate in his career, Williams faced increasingly harsh criticism. Beginning with Period of Adjustment, a comedy generally disliked by critics, there were years of rejection of play after play. By the late 1960s, even the longtime advocate Atkinson observed that in \u201ca melancholy resolution of an illustrious career\u201d the dramatist was producing plays \u201cwith a kind of desperation\u201d in which he lost control of content and style. Lewis, accusing Williams of repeating motifs, themes, and characters in play after play, asserted that in failing \u201cto expand and enrich\u201d his theme, he had \u201cdissipated a rare talent.\u201d Gilman, in a particularly vituperative review titled \u201cMr. Williams, He Dead,\u201d included in his Common and Uncommon Masks: Writings on Theatre, 1961-1970, charged that the \u201cmoralist,\u201d subtly present in earlier plays, was \u201cincreasingly on stage.\u201d Even if one granted a diminution of creative powers, however, the decline in Williams\u2019s popularity and position as major playwright in the 1960s and 1970s can be attributed in large part to a marked change in the theater itself. Audiences constantly demanded variety, and although the early creations of the playwright remained popular, theatergoers wanted something different, strange, exotic. One problem, Kerr pointed out, was that Williams was so good, people expected him to continue to get better; judging each play against those which had gone before denied a fair hearing to the new creations.\nWilliams died due to a choking accident in 1983 in New York City. Following his accidental death, some of those who had been during his last years his severest critics acknowledged the greatness of his achievement. Bigsby, for example, found in a reanalysis of the late plays more than mere vestiges of the strengths of earlier years, especially in Out Cry, an experimental drama toward which Williams felt a particular affection. Even Simon, who had dismissed play after play, acknowledged in New York that he had underestimated the playwright\u2019s genius and significance. Williams was, finally, viewed by formerly skeptical observers, as a rebel who broke with the rigid conventions of drama that had preceded him, explored new territory in his quest for a distinctive form and style, created characters as unforgettable as those of Charles Dickens, Nathaniel Hawthorne, or William Faulkner, and lifted the language of the modern stage to a poetic level unmatched in his time.\n\r\nPosthumous publications of Williams\u2019s writings\u2014correspondence and plays among them\u2014show the many sides of this complex literary legend. Five O\u2019Clock Angel: Letters of Tennessee Williams to Maria St. Just, 1948-1982 (1990) takes its title from the name the author gave to Russian-born actress and socialite Maria Britneva, later Maria St. Just, \u201cthe confidante Williams wrote to in the evening after his day\u2019s work\u2014his \u2018Five O\u2019Clock Angel,\u2019 as he called her in a typically genteel, poetic periphrasis,\u201d noted Edmund White in a piece for the New York Times Book Review. These letters, White added, allow readers \u201cto see the source of everything in his work that was lyrical, innocent, loving, and filled with laughter.\u201d Among the other works published posthumously is Something Cloudy, Something Clear. A play first produced in 1981 and published in 1995, Something Cloudy, Something Clear recounts the author\u2019s queer relationship with a dancer in Provincetown. His queerness\u2014this time in a violent context\u2014also takes center stage in Not about Nightingales, a tale of terror in a men\u2019s prison. Actress Vanessa Redgrave reportedly played a key role in bringing this early play\u2014written circa 1939\u2014to the London stage in 1998.\nWilliams is among the most quotable of American playwrights, and he remains widely celebrated for the unique language he brought to modern theater. He introduced to dramatic literature a cast of remarkable, memorable characters and turned his attention and sympathy toward people and subjects that, before his time, had been considered beneath the concern of serious authors. With \u201cdistinctive dramatic feeling,\u201d Gassner said in Theatre at the Crossroads, Williams \u201cmade pulsating plays out of his visions of a world of terror, confusion, and perverse beauty.\u201d As a result, Gassner concluded, Williams \u201cmakes indifference to the theater virtually impossible.\u201d\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southern"]}}
