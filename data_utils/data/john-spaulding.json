His collections delve into history, myth, and the American landscape, often accessing a variety of voices. Susan Donnelly noted that his work \u201cbrings images from history\u2019s shadows into deceptive clarity, only to halt us with their mystery, omen, threat, and surprise.\u201d\nSpaulding also coedited the cookbook Civil War Recipes: Receipts from the Pages of Godey\u2019s Lady\u2019s Book (1999) with this mother, Lily May Spaulding, a former nurse and restaurant owner.\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Southwestern"]}}
