(Peter) Inman\u2019s collections of poetry include Platin (1979), ocker (1982), Red Shift (1988), Criss Cross (1994), Vel (1995), at. least (1999), and Ad Finitum (2008). His work has been published in Ron Silliman\u2019s influential anthology of Language poetry In the American Tree (2001). Inman\u2019s poetry uses an anti-representational system of language. Mark Wallace, in an online article for Fascicle, noted in Inman\u2019s work the tendency for patterns to \u201cmove across poems.\u201d He found \u201cbrief images, oddly juxtaposed and undermining each other; phrases and sentences torn up by improperly placed periods; slash marks, jump cuts, stray bits of words; moments thick with meanings that never quite complete themselves; social ironies, a sly and biting humor.\u2026 It\u2019s the movement that matters, the swoops, twists, barriers, jolts.\u201d Inman has worked at the Library of Congress and been active in union organizations. He lives in Maryland with his wife, poet Tina Darragh.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"], "School/Period:": ["Language Poetry"]}}
