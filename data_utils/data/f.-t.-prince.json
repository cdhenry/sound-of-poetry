Prince, best known for the poem \u201cSoldiers Bathing,\u201d was born September 13, 1912 in Kimberly, South Africa. In 1957, Prince joined the English department at Southampton University in England, where he taught for over two decades. He also briefly taught at Oxford and Cambridge, as well as at institutions in Jamaica, the United States, and Yemen. Regarded as a significant 20th-century writer by poets as varied as\u00a0John Ashbery and\u00a0Geoffrey Hill, Prince authored more than ten books of poetry, including\u00a0Poems\u00a0(1938), Soldiers Bathing\u00a0(1954),\u00a0Walks in Rome\u00a0(1987), and\u00a0Collected Poems 1935-1992(1993 ). \nPrince studied at the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg and Balliol College, Oxford University before taking a graduate fellowship at Princeton University. He worked as foreign policy analyst upon his return to England, and his first volume of poetry, Poems, was published with the assistance of T.S. Eliot in 1938. During WWII, he served six years in the British Army\u2019s Intelligence Corps, spending time at Bletchley Park, in the Middle East, and in Italy. This wartime experience inspired \u201cSoldiers Bathing,\u201d written in 1942 and first published in the multi-author collection, More Poems for the Forces (1943). Scholar David Tacium argues Prince\u2019s \u201cmost anthologized poem ... succeeds on the basis of a direct religious reading of the \u2018facts.\u2019\u201d \u201cThe plot is direct and moving,\u201d poet and critic Philip Hobsbaum observes: \u201cSoldiers stripped of the accouterments of war show themselves thereby at once released and vulnerable. ... The poem superbly combines story line with archetype. Further, there is a highly characteristic vision here. We are aware of a detached persona considering all this ... certainly someone ... erudite, distanced, eloquent. The person is a kind of ideal aesthete.\u201d Critic\u00a0Donald Davie\u00a0lauded \u201cSoldiers Bathing\u201d as \u201cnearly the finest poem in English to come out of World War II \u2026 the only one, perhaps, that could justly be said to stand beside the classics of World War I. It is a remarkable fact that the techniques deployed in Prince\u2019s other poems do duty here: the slow-moving line, the distilled concept, the imagery refracted through recollection of great art. Yet the total effect is ... urgent and poignant.\u201d A\u00a0Choice\u00a0review of\u00a0Collected Poems\u00a0(1979) regarded \u201cSoldiers Bathing\u201d as \u201cone of the best wrought, best realized war poems of our time,\u201d and hailed Prince\u2019s \u201clinguistic and technical virtuosity.\u201d\nF.T. Prince\u2019s influences include Roy Campbell,\u00a0Ezra Pound,\u00a0T.S. Eliot,\u00a0William Butler Yeats, and\u00a0Arthur Rimbaud. Although\u00a0Richmond Lattimore\u00a0conjectures in\u00a0Hudson Review\u00a0that Prince \u201cis less well known than his illustrious contemporaries,\u201d he maintains that the author \u201cis all his own man, he is like no one else, he is a major poet.\u201d As a scholar, Prince is best known for his work on\u00a0Shakespeare\u00a0and\u00a0Milton. Critic Peter Levi believes that\u00a0The Italian Element in Milton\u2019s Verse\u00a0is Prince\u2019s \u201cmost famous critical book \u2026 a book only a poet and only a fine scholar could have written.\u201d Hobsbaum adds, \u201cit would seem that the oeuvre of Prince adds up to a respectable contribution to modern literature by a scholar-poet.\u201d \nHis work spans an impressive array of forms and is notable for the frequent use of dramatic monologue. \u201cWhat Prince\u2019s\u00a0Collected Poems\u00a0reveals is the sheer copiousness and variety of his achievement,\u201d summarizes Ben Howard in a 1980\u00a0Poetry\u00a0magazine review, \u201cwhich includes conventional stanzaic lyrics, reflective poems on historical themes, a sequence in \u2018open\u2019 form and another in a stanza borrowed from Shelley, an experiment with Bridges\u2019s 12-syllable measure, and several ambitious meditative monologues. Whatever the mode, Prince\u2019s hand is deft and firm, but his most memorable work lies in his monologues, where the romantic and scholarly lineaments of his sensibility, the leisured ease and elegance of his style, can find their fullest expression.\u201d Many of Prince\u2019s poems \u201care written either in the first person or through the medium of a commentator (as in \u2018Strafford\u2019),\u201d David Tacium notes, adding \u201cbut the first person is seldom if ever the poet himself; rather, he is a persona, often historical, who permits the \u2018realization\u2019 or \u2018dramatization\u2019 of a given theme, mood, or emotion. Prince has always been at odds with those who seek to give a reproduction of the poet\u2019s immediate experience and way of life. Choosing dramatic subjects, he has been able to convey multiple bearings and perspectives through them.\u201d\nThe formal variety in Prince\u2019s poetry was sometimes challenging for readers. In a review of Later On, A. Poulin, Jr states, \u201cadmirers of ...\u00a0Collected Poems\u00a0(1979) may find much of\u00a0Later On\u00a0quirky and frustrating.\u201d However, Poulin compliments Prince\u2019s 1983 three-poem collection for its poem, \u201cThe Yuan Chen Variations,\u201d describing it as \u201ca beautiful example of Mr. Prince\u2019s capacity for moving eloquence.\u201d William Scammell, writing in the\u00a0Times Literary Supplement,\u00a0called Prince \u201ca poet of high distinction\u201d and concluded that\u00a0Later On\u00a0\u201cis a brave and stimulating book.\u201d Describing the 12-page poem \u201cAfterword on Rupert Brooke\u201d as a journalistic biography, Levi credited Prince for creating \u201ca new literary form in English poetry\u201d that \u201cis a very effective piece.\u201d\nWhile his style did not always fall in line with literary trends, the subjects of Prince\u2019s work are perennially relevant. According to Hobsbaum, \u201cPrince has stood fast among the tides of fashion. His verse is leisurely, eloquent, syntactically elaborate. It suggests the spaciousness of a bygone age.\u201d Prince \u201cis certainly among the finest of living poets writing in metrical forms,\u201d agrees Tacium, noting that \u201cPrince\u2019s poetry has been called unfashionable, which may variously mean that it is not modern, that it does not conform to English or American trends and assumptions, or that it is too \u2018other-worldly.\u2019 But critics have also noticed that Prince deals consistently with recurring dilemmas\u2014restlessness, solitude, love, growing old, the sufferings and joys of the imaginative life\u2014in the spirit or a \u2018composer\u2019 working with a recognizable theme as his subject. His poetry offers a faithful attention to \u2018the thing itself\u2019 and a documentation of the inner life.\u201d\nF.T. Prince died on August 7, 2003 in Southampton, England. Reflecting on his work, Prince wrote, \u201cFrom the beginning it seemed to me that I would have to go my own way. But it takes a long time, and varied experience, to learn what one really thinks and feels\u2014longer if one is a poet, and if one lives in this century. Some of my past work looks strange to me now, but I have kept it because at the very least it can help towards an understanding of the better things.\u201d\n\u00a0\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
