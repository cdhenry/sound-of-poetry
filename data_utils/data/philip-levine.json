The son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Levine was born and raised in industrial Detroit, where he began working in the auto factories at the age of 14. As a young boy in the midst of the Great Depression of the 1930s, he was fascinated by the events of the Spanish Civil War. His heroes were not only those individuals who struggled against fascism but also ordinary folks who worked at hopeless jobs simply to stave off poverty. Noted for his interest in the grim reality of blue-collar work and workers, Levine resolved \u201cto find a voice for the voiceless\u201d while working in the auto plants of Detroit during the 1950s. \u201cI saw that the people that I was working with \u2026 were voiceless in a way,\u201d he explained in Detroit Magazine. \u201cIn terms of the literature of the United States they weren\u2019t being heard. Nobody was speaking for them. And as young people will, you know, I took this foolish vow that I would speak for them and that\u2019s what my life would be. And sure enough I\u2019ve gone and done it. Or I\u2019ve tried anyway.\u201d\nLevine earned his BA from Wayne State University in 1950 and began attending writing workshops at the University of Iowa, as an unregistered student, in 1953. He took classes with Robert Lowell and John Berryman, and would later pay tribute to Berryman's teaching influence on his development as a poet. Levine officially earned an MFA from the University of Iowa in 1957, and later that year won a Jones Fellowship at Stanford University. Shortly thereafter, he began teaching at the California State University, Fresno, where he would remain until 1992. Levine also taught at Columbia, Princeton, NYU, Brown, the University of California at Berkeley, and\u00a0Tufts.\n\r\nThough Levine did not return to live in Detroit, its people and economy would remain central concerns of his poetry. Critic Herbert Leibowitz, commenting\u00a0on Levine\u2019s 1980 National Book award and National Books Critics Circle award-winning collection Ashes: Poems New and Old, wrote: \u201cLevine has returned again and again in his poems to the lives of factory workers trapped by poverty and the drudgery of the assembly line, which breaks the body and scars the spirit.\u201d However, the speaker in Levine\u2019s poems \u201cis never a blue-collar caricature,\u201d argued Richard Tillinghast in his New York Times Book Review piece, \u201cbut someone with brains, feelings and a free-wheeling imagination that constantly fights to free him from his prosaic environment.\u201d In addition to concentrating on the working class in his work, Levine paid tribute to the Spanish anarchist movement of the 1930s, especially in The Names of the Lost (1976). In his book, The Fierce Embrace: A Study of Contemporary American Poetry, Charles Molesworth explained that Levine connected the Spanish revolutionaries with Detroit\u2019s laboring class during a brooding stay in Barcelona: \u201cBoth cities are built on the backs of sullen, exploited workers, and the faded revolution in one smolders like the blunting, racist fear in the other.\u201d As Leibowitz summed up, \u201cThe poet\u2019s \u2018Spanish self,\u2019 as he calls it, is kin to his Detroit self. Both bear witness to the visionary ideal destroyed.\u201d\n\r\nCritics have described Levine\u2019s work as dark and unflinching. Time contributor Paul Gray called Levine\u2019s speakers \u201cguerrillas, trapped in an endless battle long after the war is lost.\u201d This sense of defeat is particularly strong when the poet recalls scenes from his Detroit childhood, where unemployment and violence colored his life. But despite its painful material, Levine\u2019s verse can also display a certain joyfulness, suggested Marie Borroff. Writing in the Yale Review, she described the title poem of They Feed They Lion (1972) as \u201ca litany celebrating, in rhythms and images of unflagging, piston-like force, the majestic strength of the oppressed, rising equally out of the substances of the poisoned industrial landscape and the intangibles of humiliation.\u201d Richard Hugo commented in the American Poetry Review: \u201cLevine\u2019s poems are important because in them we hear and we care.\u201d Though Levine\u2019s poems are full of loss, regret and inadequacy, Hugo felt that they also embody the triumphant potential of language and song. Levine has kept alive in himself \u201cthe impulse to sing,\u201d Hugo concluded, adding that Levine \u201cis destined to become one of the most celebrated poets of the time.\u201d\n\r\nLevine\u2019s poetry for and about the common man is distinguished by simple diction and a rhythmic narrative style\u2014by what Robert Pinsky once called \u201cthe strength of a living syntax.\u201d In an American Poetry Review appraisal of Ashes (1979) and 7 Years from Somewhere (1979), contributor Dave Smith noted that in Levine\u2019s poems \u201cthe language, the figures of speech, the narrative progressions are never so obscure, so truncated as to forbid less sophisticated readers. Though he takes on the largest subjects of death, love, courage, manhood, loyalty \u2026 he brings the mysteries of existence down into the ordinarily inarticulate events and objects of daily life.\u201d Because Levine values reality above all in his poetry, his language is often earthy and direct, his syntax colloquial and his rhythms relaxed. Molesworth argued that Levine\u2019s work reflects a mistrust of language; rather than compressing multiple meanings into individual words and phrases as in traditionally conceived poetry, Levine\u2019s simple narratives work to reflect the concrete and matter-of-fact speech patterns of working people. Levine\u2019s work was typically more concerned with the known, visible world than with his own perception of those phenomena, and this made it somewhat unique in the world of contemporary poetry. Levine himself, in an interview with Calvin Bedient for Parnassus, defined his ideal poem as one in which \u201cno words are noticed. You look through them into a vision of \u2026 the people, the place.\u201d\n\r\nSeveral critics faulted Levine for his reliance on narrative descriptions of realistic situations. However, Thomas Hackett, in his review of A Walk with Tom Jefferson (1988), argued that, rather than being a weakness, Levine\u2019s \u201cstrength is the declarative, practically journalistic sentence. He is most visual and precise when he roots his voice in hard, earthy nouns.\u201d\n\r\nLevine\u2019s ability to craft deeply affecting poems has long been his hallmark. \u201cHis poems are personal, love poems, poems of horror, poems about the experiencing of America,\u201d Stephen Spender wrote in the New York Review of Books. Joyce Carol Oates commented of Levine in the American Poetry Review: \u201cHe is one of those poets whose work is so emotionally intense, and yet so controlled, so concentrated, that the accumulative effect of reading a number of his related poems can be shattering.\u201d Oates dubbed Levine \u201ca visionary of our dense, troubled mysterious time.\u201d David Baker, writing about What Work Is (1991), said Levine has \u201cone of our most resonant voices of social conviction and witness, and he speaks with a powerful clarity \u2026\u00a0What Work Is may be one of the most important books of poetry of our time. Poem after poem confronts the terribly damaged conditions of American labor, whose circumstance has perhaps never been more wrecked.\u201d The book\u00a0won the National Book Award in 1991. His next book, The Simple Truth (1994), was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry.\n\r\nLevine explored the forces that shaped his life and poetry in The Bread of Time: Toward an Autobiography (1994), a collection of nine essays in which he addresses his experiences as a factory worker, his family and friends, the writers who served as his mentors and his fascination with the Spanish Civil War and Spanish poets. Levine\u2019s portrayal of his mentors, John Berryman and Yvor Winters, garnered critical applause. Richard Eder, writing in the Los Angeles Times Book Review, considered the essays on Berryman, Winters, and the Spanish poet Antonio Machado to be the strongest in the book. Through it all, added Tod Marshall in the Georgia Review, \u201cthe book\u2019s main focus\u2014much to the benefit and delight of anyone interested in the formative years of one of our best contemporary poets\u2014is Levine\u2019s relationship with poetry.\u201d\nLevine\u2019s later books include The Mercy (1999), Breath (2004), and News of the World (2009). Breath was hailed by a Terrence Rafferty in the New York Times as a \u201cgraceful new collection\u201d that showcases Levine\u2019s unique brand of elegy, one that operates in long, thoughtful lines that summon the un-glorious past and its hard-working inhabitants. \u201cWhat gives Levine\u2019s work its urgency,\u201d Rafferty went on \u201cis that impulse to commemorate, the need to restore to life people who were never, despite their deadening work, dead things themselves, and who deserve to be rescued from the longer death of being forgotten.\u201d\n\r\nLevine won several other awards, including\u00a0the Ruth Lilly Prize in Poetry and the Wallace Stevens Award. In 2006 he was elected a a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets, and in 2011 was appointed poet laureate of the United States.\u00a0His poetry \u201cwill be remembered for his giving voice to the complicated lives of men and women and for making something closer to simple song than ordinary speech,\u201d wrote the poet Carol Frost.\u00a0\u201cThe territory of this poetry keeps coming back to a center\u2014praise for the common person, an American, probably with immigrant parents, who having gotten \u2018off the bus/at the bare junction of nothing/with nothing\u2019 manages to find a way home.\u201d\u00a0\nLevine retired from teaching at the California State University, Fresno in 1992. He split his time between Fresno and Brooklyn in his later years, before his death in early 2015. A collection of poetry, The Last Shift (2016), was published posthumously.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
