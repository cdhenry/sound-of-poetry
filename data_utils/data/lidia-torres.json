In her free verse poetry, Torres often explores the body as a site of change, bearing markers of both diminishment and desire. The Poetry Society of America chose the title poem of her debut collection, A Weakness for Boleros (2005), for its Poetry in Motion program. Her work has also been included in the anthology The Wind Shifts: New Latino Poetry (2007, edited by Francisco Arag\u00f3n). Torres cotranslated, with poet Jack Ag\u00fceros, Come, Come, My Boiling Blood: The Complete Poems of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed (2007). She is the recipient of a fellowship from the New York Foundation for the Arts and lives in New York City.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
