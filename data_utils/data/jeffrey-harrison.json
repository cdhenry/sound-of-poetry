Influenced as well by Elizabeth Bishop, John Keats, and Seamus Heaney, Harrison\u2019s personal narratives take on themes of intimacy and loss with nuance, clarity, and dark humor.\u00a0Harrison is the author of several collections of poetry, including\u00a0Into Daylight\u00a0(2014), chosen by\u00a0Tom Sleigh\u00a0for the Dorset Prize and selected by the Massachusetts Center for the Book as a Must-Read Book;\u00a0Incomplete Knowledge\u00a0(2006), a runner-up for the Poets\u2019 Prize;\u00a0Feeding the Fire\u00a0(2001); and\u00a0The Singing Underneath\u00a0(1988), chosen by James Merrill for the National Poetry Series.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn an interview for Smartish Pace, Harrison discussed the responsibilities of a poet, noting that \u201cperhaps honesty is the primary responsibility\u2014honesty about oneself and about what the world is like.\u201d Reviewing Incomplete Knowledge for the Virginia Quarterly Review, critic George David Clark praises Harrison\u2019s \u201cseemingly effortless access to both desperate sorrow and a certain joyous and musical gusto\u2014somewhat paradoxical attitudes Harrison often convincingly achieves within the space of a few lines.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nHarrison\u2019s honors include the Lavan Younger Poets Award from the Academy of American Poets, the Amy Lowell Traveling Poetry Scholarship, two Pushcart Prizes, and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHarrison has taught at George Washington University, Phillips Academy, the University of Southern Maine, and Framingham State University.
