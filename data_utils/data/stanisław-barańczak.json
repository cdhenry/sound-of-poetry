He earned both his MA and PhD in philology at Adam Mickiewicz University, where he also met his wife, Anna Brylka. Bara\u0144czak began publishing poetry and criticism in the mid-1960s. He was teaching at Mickiewicz when the government raised the price of basic goods, a move that precipitated the Warsaw riots of 1976. Bara\u0144czak helped found the Workers Defense Committee in support of those injured or persecuted because of the riots. His political activities cost him his job, and his work was officially banned. When the political movement Solidarity emerged, Bara\u0144czak regained his teaching position; however, Harvard had by then offered him a job in the department of Slavic languages and literature. After three years of being denied a visa, Bara\u0144czak moved to the United States in 1981. He taught at Harvard until his gradually worsening Parkinson\u2019s disease forced him to retire in the late 1990s.  \u00a0 Bara\u0144czak wrote about the politics of Eastern Europe in both prose and poetry. In the preface to his poetry collection in English, Selected Poems: The Weight of the Body (1989), he noted that \u201cwriting poetry is perhaps nothing more than trying to play a straight man to that rambling, rambunctious, never-to-be-interrupted, always-on-a-roll, stand-up comic, the world,\u201d and his work was generally both playful and political. His collection of essays, Breathing Under Water and Other East European Essays (1990), likewise treated the intersection of literature and politics with insight and humor. Bara\u0144czak\u2019s work as a translator also influenced his poetry and poetics. According to Clare Cavanagh, a former student with whom he translated Nobel Prize\u2013winner Wislawa Szymborska, Bara\u0144czak \u201ctranslated everyone. The metaphysicals to Bob Dylan to Ogden Nash.\u201d Bara\u0144czak translated into Polish much of Shakespeare, Robert Herrick, John Donne, and Robert Frost as well as song lyrics and light verse. When he died in 2014, Malgorzata Omilanowska, the Polish minister of culture and national heritage, said of his contributions to Polish literary history, \u201cHe dedicated his whole life to literature, to poetry. His work will always be an important part of Poland\u2019s culture.\u201d\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Poland"]}}
