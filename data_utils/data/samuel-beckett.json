Born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1906, he was educated at Trinity College. During the 1930s and 1940s he wrote his first novels and short stories. During World War II, Samuel Beckett\u2019s Irish citizenship allowed him to remain in Paris as a citizen of a neutral country. He fought in the resistance movement until 1942 when members of his group were arrested by the Gestapo. He and his wife fled to the unoccupied zone until the end of the war. After the war, Samuel Beckett was awarded the Croix de Guerre for bravery during his time in the French resistance. He settled in Paris and began his most prolific period as a writer. In five years, he wrote Eleutheria, Waiting for Godot, Endgame, the novels Malloy, Malone Dies, The Unnamable, and Mercier et Camier, two books of short stories, and a book of criticism.\nHe wrote a trilogy of novels in the 1950s as well as famous plays like Waiting for Godot. In 1969 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. His later works included poetry and short story collections and novellas.\n\r\nCritical responses to Beckett's work often invoked somewhat colorful prose. Melvin Maddocks wrote of Beckett, \u201cHe wanders among misty bogs turned surreal, he talks to the wee folk of his own bad dreams, he files reports on introspected black visions with a kind of blarney eloquence. Like an actress cradling a doll for her stage baby, his language keens and croons about tales that are not quite there.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt is neither night nor morning. A man must find himself without the support of groups, or labels, or slogans,\u201d writes R.D. Smith. And Beckett, by removing his characters from nearly all recognizable contexts, Smith continues, is \u201cengaged in finding or saving\u201d himself. Martin Esslin writes: \u201cWhat is the essence of the experience of being? asks Beckett. And so he begins to strip away the inessentials. What is the meaning of the phrase \u2018I am myself\u2019? he asks \u2026 and is then compelled to try to distinguish between the merely accidental characteristics that make up an individual and the essence of his self.\u201d A\u00a0Time\u00a0reviewer noted: \u201cSome chronicle men on their way up; others tackle men on their way down. Samuel Beckett stalks after men on their way out.\u201d Such is the tone of most discussions of Beckett\u2019s work. But no single reviewer could communicate the unique power of Beckett\u2019s writing, his use of \u201ca language in which the emptiness of conventional speech is charged with new emotion.\u201d \u201cWhile [his] lesser colleagues work in rhetoric,\u201d writes Smith, Beckett produces poetry. \u201cWell,\u201d says Harold Pinter, \u201cI\u2019ll buy his goods, hook, line, and sinker, because he leaves no stone unturned and no maggot lonely. He brings forth a body of beauty. His work is beautiful.\u201d\n\r\nAlong with the work of Eugene Ionesco, Jean Genet, and Harold Pinter, Beckett\u2019s stark plays are said to compose the \u201cTheatre of the Absurd.\u201d But to so label Beckett\u2019s work is to disqualify one of his own first premises\u2014that, since no human activity has any intrinsic meaning, it is pointless to ascribe traditional or categorical significance to the existence of an object or the performance of a deed. George Wellwarth discusses Beckett\u2019s concept of a protean reality: \u201cWhat all these things\u2014the sameness of human beings and their actions, the vanity of human ambition, the uselessness of thought\u2014amount to is a pessimism deeper than any that has ever been put into words before. Throughout Beckett\u2019s work we can find evidence of his conviction that everything is hopeless, meaningless, purposeless, and, above all, agonizing to endure. Beckett\u2019s people are leveled off and merged into each other by being all more or less physically disabled\u2014as if this were really the common condition on earth. \u2026 Beckett is a prophet of negation and sterility. He holds out no hope to humanity, only a picture of unrelieved blackness; and those who profess to see in Beckett signs of a Christian approach or signs of compassion are simply refusing to see what is there.\u201d Perhaps Beckett himself stated his dilemma most succinctly in\u00a0L\u2019Innommable: \u201cDans ma vie, puisqu\u2019il faut l\u2019appeler ainsi, il y eut trois choses, l\u2019impossibilite de parler, l\u2019impossibilite de me taire, et la solitude.\u201d (\u201cOne must speak; man cannot possibly communicate with his fellows, but the alternative\u2014silence\u2014is irreconcilable with human existence.\u201d)\n\r\nSmith and Esslin, however, insist that Beckett did not intend to express unqualified despair, but that, by stripping significance from the world, he showed us the one way to achieve redemption (although any salvation, according to Beckett\u2019s essentially deterministic philosophy, is necessarily only a respite). Smith writes: \u201cBeckett\u2019s characters remain at their darkest moments anguished human beings: Beckett, when intellectually at his most pitiless, feels and suffers with them.\u201d Esslin argues that Beckett\u2019s message \u201cis anything but gloomy or despairing.\u201d He writes: \u201cOn the contrary: the starkness of [his] reminders of the evanescence of life and the certainty of death, [his] uncompromising rejection of any easy solution or cheap illusion of comfort ultimately has a liberating effect; such is the nature of man that in the very act of facing up to the reality of his condition his dignity is enhanced; we are only defeated by things by which we are taken unawares; what we know and have faced up to we can master.\u201d Alec Reid also believes that Beckett\u2019s message must be interpreted optimistically. \u201cBeckett\u2019s world,\u201d he writes, \u201cis one of darkness, of disembodied voices, of ignorance, impotence, and anguish. But even as he insists that he knows nothing, can know nothing, Beckett reminds us of an astronaut, a human surrounded by nothing, walking on nothing. Our spacemen are no cause for despair; no more are Mr. Beckett\u2019s explorations.\u201d But then, according to\u00a0Time\u00a0magazine, \u201cBeckett\u2019s champions argue that his threnodies in dusky twilight represent the existential metaphor of the human condition, that the thin but unwavering voices of his forlorn characters speak the ultimate statement of affirmation, if only because the merest attempt at communication is itself affirmation.\u201d\n\r\nBut in case the reader of Beckett criticism should come to regard this question as the black and white one of \u201cdespair\u201d versus \u201coptimism,\u201d Richard N. Coe adds new terms to the argument: \u201cTo class Beckett himself as the simple incarnation of \u2018despair\u2019 is a drastic oversimplification. To begin with, the concept of \u2018despair\u2019 implies the existence of a related concept \u2018hope,\u2019 and \u2018hope\u2019 implies a certain predictable continuity in time\u2014which continuity Beckett would seriously question. \u2018Despair,\u2019 with all its inherent moral overtones, is a term which is wholly inadequate to describe Beckett\u2019s attitude towards the human condition; nor is this condition, in the most current sense of the definition, \u2018absurd.\u2019 It is literally and logically impossible. And in this central concept of \u2018impossibility,\u2019 his thought has most of its origins\u2014as does also his art.\u201d\n\r\nSome critics believe that Beckett\u2019s theater is most meaningful when considered within the context of a recognizable literary tradition. Kenneth Allsop writes: \u201cHis harsh, desolate, denuded style is entirely and unmistakably his own, but his literary \u2018form,\u2019 the stream-of-consciousness device which most young British writers wouldn\u2019t dream of using nowadays for fear of being thought quaint, derives from his years [working with] \u2026\u00a0James Joyce. That is only a partial explanation. He is in a monolithic way the last of the Left Bank Mohicans of the Twenties; the others of the\u00a0avant-garde\u00a0died or deserted or prospered, but Beckett was a loyal expatriate.\u201d Esslin, J.D. O\u2019Hara, and\u00a0John Fletcher\u00a0prefer to align Beckett with the philosophers. \u201cAlthough Beckett himself [was] not aware of any such influence,\u201d Esslin writes, \u201chis writings might be described as a literary exposition of Sartre\u2019s Existentialism.\u201d O\u2019Hara sees his work as exponential to the philosophy of Descartes: \u201cIn Beckett\u2019s world of post-Cartesian dualism, the mind has no connection to the body, its values worth nothing there, and so it cannot logically concern itself with the body\u2019s problems.\u201d Fletcher concludes that \u201cwhatever the truth of the matter, one thing is certain. Beckett has ranged freely among the writings of the philosophers, where he has found confirmation and justification of the metaphysical obsessions that haunt his work: the gulf set between body and mind, the epistemological incertitude. His genius has achieved the transmutation of such speculative problems into art.\u201d But, according to Coe, one must keep in mind that \u201cBeckett has renounced his claim to erudition. The main theme of his work is impotence, of mind just as much as of body.\u201d\n\r\nThe problem of analyzing and interpreting Beckett\u2019s work has been met with a somewhat surprising amount of scholarship and erudition. But David Hesla\u2019s criticism, in which the novels are considered as the expression of Beckett\u2019s personal enigma, is equally effective. Hesla notes that the dilemma which confronts the contemporary writer, according to Beckett, \u201cis constituted \u2026 by the fact that the writer must take seriously two opposed and apparently irreconcilable claims to his allegiance. On the one hand, he must recognize that the principal fact about modern man\u2019s life is that it is a \u2018mess,\u2019 a \u2018confusion,\u2019 a \u2018chaos.\u2019 On the other hand, the writer, as artist, has an obligation to form. But to admit the \u2018mess\u2019 into art is to jeopardize the very nature of art; for the mess \u2018appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be.\u2019\u201d Hesla quotes Beckett as saying: \u201cIt only means that there will be a new form; and that this form will be of such a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else. The form and the chaos remain separate. The latter is not reduced to the former. That is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation, because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates. To find a form that accommodates the mess, that is the task of the artist now.\u201d Hesla notes that with\u00a0Watt, \u201cBeckett [began] a process of removing from his artificial world those tangibles by which the reader usually is able to orient himself in time and space, and those causal relationships amongst the incidents of the plot by which the reader is able to discern the conditions of necessity and probability which\u2014be they never so strained or extraordinary\u2014determine in part the structural coherence and the \u2018meaning\u2019 of the story. \u2026 In\u00a0Watt\u00a0he has found the form which permits \u2018the mess\u2019 to enter art without destroying it. He has developed a literary method\u2014the negative way\u2014which is capable of accommodating chaos without reducing it to form.\u00a0\u2026 Beckett\u2019s work after\u00a0Watt\u00a0has, in a certain sense, consisted largely in refining and adapting both the manner and the matter of his new art.\u201d\n\r\nMost critics agree that the 1954 English-language publication of\u00a0Waiting for Godot\u00a0established Beckett\u2019s prominence in the United States. Many still consider this play to be his most important work. H.A. Smith calls it \u201cthe most comprehensively and profoundly evocative play of the last thirty years,\u201d and William R. Mueller and\u00a0Josephine Jacobsen\u00a0write: \u201cWaiting for Godot,\u00a0of all of Beckett\u2019s dramatic works, expresses most clearly and explicitly the fundamental tension\u2014to wait or not to wait\u2014which is found to a lesser degree in his other writings. The human predicament described in Beckett\u2019s first [major, staged] play is that of man living on the Saturday after the Friday of the crucifixion, and not really knowing if all hope is dead or if the next day will bring the new life which has been promised.\u201d Allsop found the play\u2019s message less ambiguous. He writes: \u201cGodot\u00a0is a hymn to extol the moment when the mind swings off its hinges. \u2026 Beckett is unconcerned with writing requiems for humanity, for he sees life as polluted and pointless: he merely scrawls its obituary, without bitterness or compassion because he cannot really believe it is worth the words he is wasting.\u201d Gassner also found the play to be a straightforward pronouncement, but he did not accept it as a prediction of certain doom. \u201cTo all this tohu and bohu about the profundity and difficulty of the play,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmy reply is simply that there is nothing painfully or exhilaratingly ambiguous about\u00a0Waiting for Godot\u00a0in the first place. It presents the view that man, the hapless wanderer in the universe, brings his quite wonderful humanity\u2014his human capacity for hope, patience, resilience, and, yes, for love of one\u2019s kind, too, as well as his animal nature\u2014to the weird journey of existence. He is lost in the universe and found in his own heart and in the hearts of his fellow men.\u201d Bert O. States adds parenthetically: \u201cConvicts and children love it!\u201d\n\r\nKenneth Tynan believes that the implications of\u00a0Waiting for Godot\u00a0are significant not only in themselves, but for all of contemporary theater. He writes: \u201cA special virtue attaches to plays which remind the drama of how much it can do without and still exist. By all known criteria, Beckett\u2019s\u00a0Waiting for Godot\u00a0is a dramatic vacuum. Pity the critic who seeks a chink in its armour, for it is all chink. It has no plot, no climax, no\u00a0denouement;\u00a0no beginning, no middle, and no end. Unavoidably, it has a situation, and it might be accused of having suspense. \u2026 Waiting for Godot\u00a0frankly jettisons everything by which we recognise theatre. It arrives at the custom-house, as it were, with no luggage, no passport, and nothing to declare; yet it gets through, as might a pilgrim from Mars. It does this, I believe, by appealing to a definition of drama much more fundamental than any in the books. A play, it asserts and proves, is basically a means of spending two hours in the dark without being bored. \u2026 It forced me to re-examine the rules which have hitherto governed the drama; and, having done so, to pronounce them not elastic enough.\u201d\n\r\nSome critics found 1957\u2019s\u00a0Endgame\u00a0to be an even more powerful expression of Beckett\u2019s negativism. Gassner wrote: \u201cNothing happens in\u00a0Endgame\u00a0and that nothing is what matters. The author\u2019s feeling about nothing also matters, not because it is true or right but because it is a strongly formed attitude, a felt and expressed viewpoint. \u2026 The yardsticks of dialectical materialism and moralism are equally out in appraising the play. Dialectical materialism could only say that\u00a0Endgame\u00a0is decadent. Moralism and theology would say that the play is sinful, since nothing damns the soul so much as despair of salvation. Neither yardstick could tell us that this hauntingly powerful work of the imagination is art.\u201d\n\r\nAlthough critics discuss his plays more frequently than his novels, Beckett was said to have considered his novels to be his major works. Alec Reid notes: \u201cFor Beckett each novel is a journey into the unknown, into an area of utter lawlessness.\u201d And a\u00a0Times Literary Supplement\u00a0reviewer, in his discussion of\u00a0Imagination Dead Imagine,\u00a0summarizes Beckett\u2019s work thus: \u201c[This novel] certainly describes two people in an imaginary situation and it is equally certainly a work of large implications and a desolate, cruel beauty. It might not seem so, however, if it had not been apparent for some time that Mr. Beckett\u2019s prose narratives compose a single, long saga of exclusion and heroic relinquishment as well as of the desperate, perhaps unavailing, pursuit of finality.\u201d A.I. Leventhal writes: \u201cWhen Beckett changes to writing his novels in French he leaves behind him much of the humour, grim as it was, in his previous work. He has less interest in making his characters indulge in games to pass the time as in\u00a0Waiting for Godot.\u00a0They are now concentrating on their\u00a0penible\u00a0task of dying.\u201d Frank Kermode offers this analysis of the novels: \u201cIn Beckett\u2019s plays the theatrical demand for communicable rhythms and relatively crude satisfactions has had a beneficent effect. But in the novels he yields progressively to the magnetic pull of the primitive, to the desire to achieve, by various forms of decadence and deformation, some Work that eludes the intellect, avoids the spread nets of habitual meaning. Beckett is often allegorical, but he is allegorical in fitful patches, providing illusive toeholds to any reader scrambling for sense.\u201d Bersani hasn\u2019t discovered the toeholds (and laughs behind his hand at those who have), nor does he think he will, if, as he says, he continues to take Beckett \u201cseriously.\u201d Bersani writes: \u201cThe most interesting fact about Samuel Beckett\u2019s novels is that they are, at their best, almost completely unreadable.\u201d Bersani, citing Beckett\u2019s expressed desire to fail (to be an artist, for Beckett, is to fail), finds his \u201cextreme attempt to render literature autonomous\u201d to be not only \u201can ironic reminder of the ultimate dependence of literature on life,\u201d but also a generally suspicious undertaking. \u201cThe attempt to eliminate \u2018occasion\u2019 from art,\u201d he writes, \u201cis in itself an occasion, and insofar as this attempt is a process of what [Ruby] Cohn has called progressive \u2018retrenchment,\u2019 the process rather than the achievement becomes the subject of Beckett\u2019s work.\u201d\n\r\nThe fact that most of Beckett\u2019s important work was originally written in French is far more than coincidentally significant to his stylistic achievement. Coe explains: \u201cBeckett, in the final analysis, is trying to say what cannot be said; he must be constantly on his guard, therefore, never to yield to the temptation of saying what the words would make him say. Only when language is, as it were, defeated, bound hand and foot; only when it is so rigorously disciplined that each word describes exactly and quasiscientifically the precise concept to which it is related and no other, only then, by the progressive elimination of that which precisely is, is there a remote chance for the human mind to divine the ultimate reality which is not. And this relentless, almost masochistic discipline, which reaches its culmination in\u00a0Comment c\u2019est,\u00a0Beckett achieves by writing in a language which is not his own\u2014in French.\u201d John Barth explains, however, that Beckett\u2019s denuded French is yet only another step in his creative process and must not be construed as a total achievement. Barth writes: \u201cBeckett has become virtually mute, musewise, having progressed from marvelously constructed English sentences through terser and terser French ones to the unsyntactical, unpunctuated prose of\u00a0Comment c\u2019est\u00a0and \u2018ultimately\u2019 to wordless mimes. One might extrapolate a theoretical course for Beckett: language, after all, consists of silence as well as sound, and the mime is still communication, \u2026 but by the language of action. But the language of action consists of rest as well as movement, and so in the context of Beckett\u2019s progress immobile, silent figures still aren't altogether ultimate. \u2026 For Beckett [in the 1960s, toward the end of his writing career], to cease to create altogether would be fairly meaningful: his crowning work, his \u2018last word.\u2019 What a convenient corner to paint yourself into!\u201d\n\r\nIn 1967 the Firehouse Theatre of Minneapolis, directed by Marlow Hotchkiss, performed\u00a0Act without Words I\u00a0and\u00a0Act without Words II\u00a0simultaneously. Also in 1967, Jack Emery composed and performed an hour-long, one-man program consisting of \u201ca selection of the desperate reveries and furious tirades of half a dozen of Samuel Beckett\u2019s dying heroes,\u201d including Malone, Hamm, and the Unnamable. A\u00a0Punch\u00a0reviewer writes: \u201cMany of the passages are fatiguing to follow in the original novels but so conversational are the rhythms of Beckett\u2019s language and so eloquently does Mr. Emery speak them (except when he essays a scream) that the effect in a dark, hushed theatre of this grim gallows humour is electrifying. There is more to life than talking of waiting for death, but Beckett has phrases\u2014\u2018Vent the pent!\u2019\u2014that resound in the mind with the urgency of great poetry.\u201d Emery\u2019s program, which premiered at Arts Theatre, London, was also produced in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Exeter. Two years later, in 1969, Beckett won the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\r\nAlthough unpublished for 60 years, Beckett\u2019s first novel,\u00a0Dream of Fair to Middling Women,\u00a0finally made it into print in the United States in 1993. The author composed the book as a young man of 26 during a summer spent in Paris. The protagonist of\u00a0Dream\u00a0is the adventurous Belacqua, and the story centers on his varied experiences in Dublin and Paris. Beckett\u2019s style here, writes Colm To\u00edb\u00edn in the\u00a0London Review of Books, \u201cis a rambling stream of consciousness, full of asides and associations, with a tone of half-seriousness and oblique mockery. \u2026The writing is self-conscious: it reads as though the writer wrote it merely to read it himself.\u201d Beckett himself described\u00a0Dream\u00a0as \u201cthe chest into which I threw my wild thoughts.\u201d And, as J.D. O\u2019Hara comments in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review, \u201che reused them, often word for word.\u201d In the end, George Craig asserts in the\u00a0Times Literary Supplement, \u201cthis is Beckett\u2019s earliest venture, and it shows. \u2026 But \u2026 something important is going on: the search for [his] voice.\u201d\n\r\nSimilarly, Beckett\u2019s first play,\u00a0Eleutheria\u00a0(the title means \u201cfreedom\u201d in Greek), collected dust in the author\u2019s trunk for nearly 50 years before being published in 1995. The dark, three-act comic piece concerns a privacy-obsessed writer who tries in vain to escape from his family and friends, spending most of the play fighting off their efforts to mend what\u2019s left of his life.\u00a0Eleutheria\u00a0was written just prior to\u00a0Waiting for Godot,\u00a0but it demanded rather complex staging (17 characters and two sets, both which are shown simultaneously in the first two acts before one disappears into the orchestra pit in the final act) and so was not produced in the 1950s when\u00a0Godot\u00a0burst onto the contemporary theatrical scene.\n\r\n\u201cNo one \u2026 disputes that Beckett did not want\u00a0Eleutheria\u00a0published,\u201d explains Jonathan Kalb in an article for the\u00a0Village Voice.\u00a0Its publication in 1995 prompted considerable controversy among members of the literary establishment, with opponents appalled at the thought of the author\u2019s final request for its suppression\u2014from his deathbed, no less\u2014being ignored. Kalb notes that the play is neither \u201ca hidden masterpiece\u201d nor \u201ca catastrophe,\u201d but rather \u201ca fascinating, rare instance of Beckettian excess. \u2026 At times windy, redundant, even confusing, it will certainly take its proper place as a minor, formative work that is bouyed by eloquent and hilarious passages and the tantalizing seeds of great themes, devices, and characters to come.\u201d As Mel Gussow puts it in the\u00a0New York Times Book Review, \u201cWaiting for Godot\u00a0is revolutionary;\u00a0Eleutheria\u00a0is evolutionary.\u201d\n\r\nFew critics have discussed Beckett\u2019s ideas (or the man himself) apart from their manifestation in his work. And Beckett would doubtless have it so. As Robert Wernick writes, \u201cso striking is the personality that emerges from [his] gloomy plays and so striking [was] the occasionally glimpsed, gaunt pterodactylous face of the real-life Samuel Beckett that many people assume[d] the two [were] identical. A whole folklore of anecdote has grown up around Beckett, in which he appears as a fanatic solitary, brooding eternally \u2026 on the black mystery of the human race. \u2026 It is true that he \u2026 built a wall around his country house, but he denie[d] that he built it, as people contend, to shut out the view. It is true he avoid[ed] all the trappings of the celebrity life, [gave] no interviews, attend[ed] no cultural congresses. But then, why should he [have]?\u201d Alec Reid met Beckett in New York during the making of\u00a0Film\u00a0and described him as \u201ca close-knit person, all of a piece.\u201d Reid says that Beckett \u201cbelieve[d] that physical movement conveys at least as much as the words. \u2026 Once the initial reserve \u2026 evaporated Beckett reveal[ed] a genius for companionship, a remarkable ability to make those around him feel the better for his presence.\u201d\nThe 1960s were a period of change for Samuel Beckett. He found great success with this plays across the world. Invitations came to attend rehearsals and performances which led to a career as a theater director. In 1961, he secretly married Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnuil who took care of his business affairs. A commission from the BBC in 1956 led to offers to write for radio and cinema through the 1960s.\nSamuel Beckett continued to write throughout the 1970s and 80s mostly in a small house outside Paris. There he could give total dedication to his art evading publicity. In 1969, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, though he declined accepting it personally to avoid making a speech at the ceremonies. However, he should not be considered a recluse. He often times met with other artists, scholars and admirers to talk about his work.\nBy the late 1980s, Samuel Beckett was in failing health and had moved to a small nursing home. Suzanne, his wife, had died in July 1989. His life was confined to a small room where he would receive visitors and write. He died on December 22, 1989, in a hospital of respiratory problems\u00a0just months after his wife.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Ireland & Northern Ireland"]}}
