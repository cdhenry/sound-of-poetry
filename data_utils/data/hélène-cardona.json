She earned her MA in American literature from the Sorbonne, where she wrote her thesis on Henry James. Cardona is the author of the bilingual collections Life in Suspension (2016), called \u201ca vivid self-portrait as scholar, seer and muse\u201d by John Ashbery; Dreaming My Animal Selves (2013), and The Astonished Universe (2006). David Mason describes Cardona\u2019s poetry as \u201climinal, mystical and other-worldly,\u201d adding, \u201cthis is a\u00a0poet who writes in a rare light.\u201d\u00a0The book was included in\u00a0The London Magazine\u2019s\u00a0alternative poetry list for 2015, which hailed it as \u201csimultaneously rapturous and lucid.\u201d\nCardona\u2019s luminous poetry, hailed as visionary by Richard Wilbur, explores consciousness, the power of place, and ancestral roots. It is poetry of alchemy and healing, a gateway to the unconscious\u00a0and the dream world. Stephen\u00a0Yenser calls Life in Suspension\u00a0\u201ca terrific and singular achievement,\u201d and Joanne Harris declares it deeply spiritual, \u201ca tour de force of language and phonetics.\u201d Exploring language and the psyche, Cardona discussed her poetry in a 2014 interview: \u201cThe poem is a gesture, an opening towards a greater truth or understanding. Art brings us to the edge of the incomprehensible. The poems, in their alchemy and geology, are fragments of dreams, enigmas, shafts of light, part myth, and part fable.\u201d\nCardona\u2019s translations include Beyond Elsewhere (by Gabriel Arnou-Laujeac, 2016), recipient of a Hemingway Grant; Ce que nous portons (Dorianne Laux, 2014); The Birnam Wood (by her father Jos\u00e9 Manuel Cardona,\u00a02018); and, with Yves Lambrecht, Walt Whitman\u2019s Civil War Writings for WhitmanWeb (2015). She has also translated Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Ren\u00e9 Depestre, Ernest P\u00e9pin, Aloysius Bertrand, Maram Al-Masri, Eric Sarner, Jean-Claude Renard, Nicolas Grenier, and Christiane Singer.\nCardona\u2019s work has been translated into 13 languages. She has received awards from the Goethe-Institut and the Universidad Internacional de Andaluc\u00eda. She has taught at Hamilton College and Loyola Marymount University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["France"]}}
