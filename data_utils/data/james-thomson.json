Thomson, however, was also a political figure through other poems and through some of his plays, standing strongly for a kind of republican ideal against what he saw as the vulpine individualism and oligarchic government of Robert Walpole. As a Scot who spent his adult life in England, he embodied in his work a comity between the two lands and traditions. Partly with these sociopolitical interests in mind, partly to complement the sweep and poignancy of The Seasons, he wrote five tragedies and a patriotic masque of some distinction. Finally, his Spenserian allegory, The Castle of Indolence (1748), stands as the finest in English other than Edmund Spenser\u2019s own.\nThe son of the Scots clergyman Thomas Thomson and Beatrix Trotter Thomson of Berwickshire, Thomson was born on September 11, 1700 in Ednam, Scotland, a few miles north of the River Tweed, which marks the Scots-English boundary. On this poor, isolated, hilly territory, country people scratched out bare livings. Critics eager to spy out biographical influences on The Seasons have found the goads to Thomson\u2019s pictorial imagination in this border landscape, with its slopes and streams, skies heavy with clouds above the moors, and the constant play of light upon natural objects in such a changeable, assertive climate. Thomson\u2019s own family was large\u2014he was the fourth of nine children\u2014and, tucked away in barren country, he must have spent a great deal of time in familial games, tasks, and learning. His household, as one would expect from that of a clergyman father and a mother whose \u201cdevotional exercises,\u201d according to Patrick Murdoch, were raised by her warm imagination \u201cto a pitch bordering on enthusiasm,\u201d gave him intimate knowledge of the Bible, that prime source of literary sublimity in the 18th century. Again, one can fancy that his early life was grist for The Seasons, in which love and family take on a rosy gleam and where God in His majesty pervades the text. As to his later life, as opposed to his poetry, he left the wild scenery of Scotland for London streets, never married or raised a family himself, and though he remained a profoundly religious man, lapsed from his Christian faith.\nBeginning at the age of 12, Thomson was sent to school, first for three years at Jedburgh, eight miles from home, and then, in 1715, at the College of Edinburgh, some fifty miles north. He was to be in Edinburgh for 10 years. After a short time his family embosomed him again, for in February 1716 Thomas Thomson died, allegedly by being struck on the head by a ball of fire while exorcising a ghost at Woolie. Since Beatrix Thomson could, of course, no longer live in the manse, she chose to bring her family to the capital. Thomson may have once again enjoyed the comforts and suffered the constraints of home, but he now found himself in a culturally exciting environment. While at Jedburgh, his learning and writing had been fostered by interested neighborhood gentry, including Robert Riccaltoun and William Bennet, the latter a frequent host to the prolific, charming Scots songwriter, patriot, and poet Allan Ramsay, whom young Thomson may then have met. In Edinburgh he was exposed to new literature, such as the periodical work of Joseph Addison and Richard Steele and the poetry of Alexander Pope, and to new doctrines, including those of Isaac Newton. Those with common interests formed clubs and societies in which they could discuss readings, debate one another, share the pleasures of the taverns in which they met, and exchange criticism and support for their own work as writers. Thomson became a member of the Grotesque Club. He had not been a stellar student and, according to his fellow club member and lifelong friend David Malloch, did not shine in the club either. Nonetheless, as a member in early January 1720 he did publish his first verse, three poems in The Edinburgh Miscellany. All three are in couplets, and all bear the marks of a gentlemanly idleness, a refusal of focus and commitment.\nIn 1719 Thomson finished his arts course without taking a degree, a common procedure, and entered divinity studies as a scholarship student (in Scots terminology, a bursar); he held the bursary for four years. This new course of study was not very exacting; it certainly did not impede Thomson from continuing in his literary career. The annals of 18th-century poetry include a good deal of verse by clergymen, fancifully or earnestly whiling away their bucolic hours, and perhaps Thomson would have ended up in earned obscurity if he had been an Englishman. His talents were ill suited for casual verse. Fortunately for literature, however, the Scots church was hostile to poetic effusions. According to Murdoch, when Thomson performed an exercise in divinity class, the paraphrase of a psalm, in too florid a way, Professor William Hamilton at Edinburgh \u201ctold him, smiling, that if he thought of being useful in the ministry, he must keep a stricter rein on his imagination, and express himself in a language more intelligible to an ordinary congregation.\u201d In general the Scots at the time seem to have tended toward respect for the practical and snorted about the poetical. As he became less willing to give over his life and skills to the church, Thomson came progressively to realize that as a writer he would never revel in a large audience if he stayed in Scotland. By 1724, when a poem probably his, \u201cThe Works and Wonders of Almighty Power,\u201d appeared in Aaron Hill\u2019s London periodical The Plain Dealer, he seems to have made up his mind to go south, as his friend Malloch (by then anglicized to \u201cMallet\u201d) had done the year before. Armed with letters of introduction to well-placed Scots in London, Thomson sailed from Leith early in 1725, never again to set foot in Scotland.\nAfter a few months of unhappy floundering, made more painful by his mother\u2019s death in mid May, his contacts found him a job as tutor to the son of the minor poet Charles, Lord Binning, who was himself the son of a minor poet, Thomas Hamilton, Earl of Haddington, and the son-in-law of the poet and songwriter Lady Grizel Baillie. At Lord Binning\u2019s country house at East Barnet, some 10 miles north of London, Thomson set about teaching his pupil to read; he also taught himself to write a new, blank verse poetry, as he worked on Winter. How much of this remarkable poem was written in Scotland and how much in England is not known, but at the end of the winter of 1725\u20131726 it was complete, and it appeared in April 1726. The second edition of Winter was published in July, and two further reimpressions came out the same year. To Thomson\u2019s eventual pleasure, his dedicatee Spencer Compton, speaker of the House of Commons, found that he could not continue to ignore the young Scot, and an interview between them ended with Thomson 20 guineas richer. Confident and on his way to being famous, Thomson began work on Summer, which appeared in February 1727, two years after his arrival in London. It confirmed the success of the poetic mode first deployed in Winter.\n\u201cBlank verse,\u201d wrote Raymond Dexter Havens, \u201cseems to have been regarded in 1725 much as the telephone was in 1875, as a remarkable toy which it was interesting to experiment with but of which only a few enthusiasts expected to make any real use.\u201d Bell did not patent his phone until 1876, however, whereas by Havens\u2019s count, some 150 post-Miltonic blank verse poems (some very short) preceded Winter. Unlike those 150, though, Winter is sustained, serious, and skillful. The earlier blank verse corpus, which led Thomson to write and the public to accept this new poem, included Milton\u2019s epics Paradise Lost (1667) and Paradise Regained (1671) as its most distinguished nondramatic examples. It also included every tragedy current on the London stage, and Thomson couched Winter as a prolonged soliloquy or dialogue with oneself and one\u2019s surroundings. The speaker does often launch into imperatives that in some other poem, in another idiom, might address a reader directly: \u201cSee! Winter comes\u201d; \u201cBehold! the wellpois\u2019d Hornet, hovering, hangs\u201d; \u201cNow ... let me wander o\u2019er the russet Mead\u201d; \u201cOh! bear me then to high, embowering, Shades.\u201d Here, though, they represent an inner urgency on the part of the speaker as his eye lights on the hornet or a keen wish strikes him. To some extent like soliloquists in drama, Thomson\u2019s speaker draws readers in to his inner state, but through indirect address. A combination of sympathy with the alert, urgent speaker and the resonance of the imperative form makes Thomson\u2019s reader a tacitly summoned participant in the speaker\u2019s excitement.\nThis roundabout way of talking to the audience makes apropos the analogy with blank verse dramatic soliloquies, including those in Paradise Lost. Yet there is a difference. In Thomson, the effect is, by intention, psychologically shallow: whereas the self-absorbed Satan, the leading soliloquizer in Milton\u2019s poem, acts\u2014busying himself making a hell of heaven\u2014Thomson\u2019s speaker cultivates pure reaction. For example, he welcomes the \u201cVapours, and Clouds, and Storms ... that exalt the Soul to solemn Thought\u201d and become \u201ckindred Glooms\u201d and \u201cwish\u2019d, wint\u2019ry, Horrors.\u201d As the scenes in Winter typify that season, so the speaker as onlooker must typify responses to it, and this interplay of what is common, open, broadly available in the world and in the speaker helps to express the sense of community that is central not only to this poem but to all Thomson\u2019s mature work. Nature in Winter is objective, \u201cout there,\u201d and Thomson\u2019s speaker, through typification, becomes an analogue to this objectivity, though with a difference. Thomson typifies winter kaleidoscopically, by adding and mirroring new scenes one after the other; in contrast, his uniformly responsive speaker hardly develops a personality at all. Still, however standard the responses, Winter requires that they seem to emerge from experience. They could plausibly be framed in a blank verse that had strong generic associations with the drama. For Thomson himself, in whose mind the I, \u201cnurs\u2019d by careless Solitude\u201d, was probably not pure textual fiction, the use of dramatic monologue allowed him to accommodate his Scots experience to his new, English life: a young emigr\u00e9 author might be jarred in moving from Edinburgh to London, from a city of about thirty-five thousand people tightly nested in rural land to a city of about 600,000, with room for urban sprawl. A dramatic self-projection, which is a self-reduction, allows him to be personal and at the same time to rise above the merely personal.\nWinter presents itself as a retrospective poem of multiple estrangements and renewals, treating a nonurban milieu divinely created, fixed by natural rhythms. In recollecting his past for his dramatic monologue, Thomson needed at once to magnify these rhythms and to stand back from them, to come to terms with them, and to pen them in an ordering plan. He could do this best by setting the poem in the country, where nothing softens winter, and to organize it through balancing event with commentary, that which is in natural time with that which is not. Winter, therefore, has four movements in its 406 lines, in each of which the bleak, cruel season comes, and then the poem redresses its action. The \u201cSullen, and sad\u201d winter of the opening produces \u201cPhilosophic Melancholy,\u201d which wakens sympathy, and its partner, aesthetic pleasure in nature; next, winter, \u201cStriding the gloomy Blast,\u201d leads to reflections on the majesty of nature and, after more description, of God; then oncoming winter strands the poet at home with his books, a \u201cSociety divine\u201d of the aesthetic and moral great; finally \u201cthe wintry Season\u201d conquers all, producing an exhortation on vanities and a theodicy, when \u201cTime swiftly fleets, / And wish\u2019d Eternity, approaching, brings / Life undecaying.\u201d This clear pattern, doubled in each of the first two movements and more sustained in the last two, encompasses both the variety of the season as it moves toward uniformity (\u201cHorror wide extends / His solitary Empire\u201d) and a single moral and aesthetic sense of life, variously prompted by winter but capable, as the other poems in The Seasons were to show, of equally being prompted by the world in other forms.\nIn May 1726 Thomson left Lord Binning\u2019s employ to live in London, again as a tutor, but now affiliated with a school well known for its Newtonian teachings, Watts\u2019s Academy. One of the teachers there, the mathematician James Stirling, knew Newton well, so well that Newton had even sent him money to return from Venice so that Newton might recommend him for a professorship. Perhaps in part through such colleagues, in part through his own teachers in Edinburgh, Thomson had learned enough about Newton to have placed passages in Summer about gravitation, optical refraction, and \u201cthe Man of Philosophic Eye\u201d who looks for the physical causes of the aurora borealis rather than succumb to popular superstition about it. Both Winter and Summer are also rich with scientific explanation about such phenomena as bituminous vapors, lightning, ripening minerals, and fogs, all matters within the purview of the Royal Society over which Newton presided. Not only did Newton penetrate the order of nature and therefore, theologically, some of nature\u2019s meaning as God\u2019s other Book, but he also was one of the chief glories of Britain, to which Thomson\u2019s deep loyalty never wavered. Unsurprisingly, then, Thomson was among the multitude who wrote commemorative verse after Newton\u2019s death on March 20, 1727. The result, dedicated to Prime Minister Walpole, was published in May 1727, A Poem Sacred to the Memory of Sir Isaac Newton.\nBecause Newton, like his contemporary John Locke, had long been deified in English patriotic myth, his soul\u2019s ascent would have seemed merely to confirm his proper place. Writers proclaimed that his grasp of the vast cosmic machine made him the modern counterpart of visionary prophets, and also better in combining imagination and reason. Indeed, his epic work spoke of what appeared to be the highest values of the true, the good, and the beautiful: the true because knowledge of God\u2019s world glorified Him, empowered His human creatures, and swept away old superstitions; the good because the Newtonian system typified a universe of cooperative motion like the balanced constitution of Britain itself (unlike French despotism); and the beautiful because the spectacle of nature offered unity in variety, with objects often beautiful in themselves and always so when considered within the great order in which they shared. The 50 years before Thomson\u2019s birth and the first quarter of the new century had seen the triunity of true, good, and beautiful split apart, to be studied within three different sciences: \u201cnatural philosophy\u201d; ethics and a rationalized natural law; and the youngest branch of philosophy, aesthetics. Precisely on account of this splitting, Newton\u2019s harmonizing system was all the more gratifying, difficult, and therefore, in its triumphant absolutism, magnificent. It has turned out, as Thomson and his contemporaries could not guess, to be the last system in the history of Western thought to provide society with an ontological guarantee of harmony. At the time, Newtonian thought as a guarantor of values was, if anything, more important than Newton the discoverer of natural, therefore divine, order. Of course a poet who was in the process of becoming the author of The Seasons saw and responded to the mythic power of such harmony in the 1720s, in appreciating Newton\u2019s work as in creating his own.\nOthers, most notably Pope in Epistle II of An Essay on Man (1733), moralized Newton as a genius still ignorant, as an emblem of limited human knowledge and so an a fortiori argument for humility. Thomson does not. His heroic Newton reunites Truth, Goodness, and Beauty by tracing \u201cthe secret Hand of Providence,\u201d by surpassing in scope and ethical merit the ancients\u2019 conquests won through \u201cViolence unmanly, and sore Deeds / Of Cruelty and Blood,\u201d and by untwisting \u201call the shining Robe of Day,\u201d revealing a world of light, that \u201cInfinite Source / Of Beauty, ever-flushing, ever-new!\u201d Behind this achievement plays the rhetoric of temporality, since, after all, Thomson was writing a memorial poem. He therefore traces Newton\u2019s career through time, as \u201cwith heroic Patience Years on Years / Deep-searching,\u201d Newton \u201csaw at last the System dawn, / And shine, of all his Race, on him alone.\u201d Thomson presents first the earthly, then the cosmic effects of gravitation; next, the plotting of orbits, even those of comets; the wonders of Newton\u2019s optics; and finally a brief tribute to the historical research\u2014the recovery of human time itself\u2014with which the great man occupied his later years. But for Newton a career in time mirrors a career after time. His progress on earth resembles that progress toward full and universal knowledge that some writers of the time saw as a promised delight of heaven: Newton\u2019s terrestrial life gave a foretaste of the hereafter to which he had now flown, to continue \u201ccomparing Things with Things, in Rapture lost, / And grateful Adoration\u201d among \u201cthe whirling Orbs.\u201d Similarly, on earth he anticipated the very tone of mind that marks him on high, where he can sit \u201cin dread Discourse\u201d with angels or the other blessed; here among mortals he shared with his friends \u201cthe vast unborrow\u2019d Treasures of his Mind,\u201d always \u201cFervent in doing well.\u201d\nThomson in his mid 20s had made a considerable reputation, and the humble Scots tutor felt confident enough to pitch himself into politics, at least in verse, with the poem Britannia. He now enjoyed the benefits of lofty friends, such as Algernon and Frances Seymour, the Earl and Countess of Hertford; the future bishop Thomas Rundle; the Oxford professor of poetry Joseph Spence; and George Bubb Dodington, Baron Melcombe, the dedicatee of Summer. In January 1729, perhaps influenced by Dodington\u2019s political advice, Thomson published anonymously his patriotic poem Britannia. When he had dedicated his lines on Newton to Walpole, Walpole and Dodington had been allies; now they were not. British indignation in the late 1720s was rising over Walpole\u2019s conciliatory\u2014some thought cowardly\u2014posture toward Spain, a nation that had besieged Gibraltar in February 1727 without calling forth a declaration of war from England. By the beginning of 1729, a process of peacemaking, begun in May 1727, was still incomplete, stalled after the congress of Soissons, and not to be given (temporary) fulfillment till the Treaty of Seville in March 1729. Meanwhile, according to the patriot opposition, Spain continued to harm British interests on the high seas. Britannia appeared just in time for the opening of Parliament, with a Virgilian quotation from the indignant Neptune on its title page, and opening lines that presented a weeping Britannia, her garments rent and her laments flowing. \u201cUnchastis\u2019d, the insulting Spaniard dares / Infest the trading Flood\u201d on which she gazes, while the weak, demoralized British slink. Peace, \u201cfirst of human Blessings; and supreme!\u201d is what Britannia desires, but sometimes war must keep the peace, \u201cwhen Ruffian Force / Awakes the Fury of an injur\u2019d State.\u201d Britannia invokes the glorious past of Britain, its special resources \u201cBy lavish Nature thrust into your Hand,\u201d its emptiness if deprived of trade, and the beauties of Liberty, \u201cThe Light of Life! the Sun of Human Kind! / Whence Heroes, Bards, and Patriots borrow Flame.\u201d At the conclusion she realizes that Parliament has convened\u2014\u201cmy Sons, the Sons of Freedom! meet / In awful Senate\u201d\u2014and flies there to \u201cBurn in the Patriot\u2019s Thought, flow from his Tongue / In fearless Truth.\u201d\nSince both government and opposition seized on Britannia, it must have been thought successful. The opposition\u2019s use for it is plain, but the pro-Walpole faction also managed to turn it to advantage. The government newspaper, the Daily Journal (January 28, 1729), quoted Britannia\u2019s paean to peace, insisting that the \u201ccharming ... Description\u201d would lead one \u201cto extol and applaud the Pacific Measures that have hitherto been pursu\u2019d by his Majesty and his Ministers, to preserve to us those invaluable Blessings\u201d and to \u201cgive so just a Preference to those Divine Men ... who study to cultivate the Arts of Peace.\u201d Despite this appropriation, other poets and pamphleteers hostile to Walpole\u2019s pacifism also took up Thomson\u2019s lead. The policy of war was eventually pursued unto disillusionment, and its heralds were forgotten. To the reader for whom the policy decisions of 1729 have lost their savor, Britannia, too, will have lost most of its.\nAnother public venue, besides political agitation, was the stage. Thomson\u2019s gift with blank verse and serious sentiments made tragedy a natural outlet for him, and the \u201cRoman\u201d genre, parented by John Dryden\u2019s All for Love (1677) and Addison\u2019s Cato (1713), was the mode of choice. In all he was to write five such plays, some more specifically \u201cRoman\u201d than others. The first of these, The Tragedy of Sophonisba, was performed at Drury Lane on February 28, 1730. As reported by Grant, the painter William Aikman, one of Thomson\u2019s good friends, said it was praised on rehearsal so \u201cextravagantly\u201d by the actress \u201cMrs Oldfield and several of the [other] players\u201d as to make him worry: \u201cI wish they may not raise peoples\u2019 expectations to a height about it that cannot be satisfied.\u201d The cast and Thomson\u2019s lines, though, proved more than equal to the public\u2019s hopes. Anne Oldfield, a great Cleopatra and (in Nicholas Rowe\u2019s The Fair Penitent, 1703) Calista, played the title role; Thomson wrote in the preface to the published play that \u201cshe excelled what, even in the fondness of an author, I could either wish or imagine.\u201d The equally skilled Robert Wilks, impetuous and tender, was a fine Masinissa. Several of the royal family attended, and Thomson received permission to dedicate the play to the queen. Continuing the theme of Britannia, he did so by comparing the naval and commercial power of Sophonisba\u2019s Carthage unfavorably with that of Caroline\u2019s England.\nThomson began with a much-used story, most familiar on the London stage in a version by Nathaniel Lee (1675) still occasionally revived. It comes from Livy\u2019s histories, where the beautiful Carthaginian Sophonisba, after the Romans\u2019 defeat of her nation, wins back the heart of her former betrothed, Prince Masinissa, now allied with the enemy. Scipio Africanus, fearful of her influence, successfully exhorts the blushing, groaning, and weeping prince to valor, not the weakness of love, and Masinissa presents his new bride with a bowl of poison so that she may save herself from the Roman slavery to which he otherwise would have to consign her. She drinks fearlessly and dies. By and large, Thomson (unlike Lee) keeps to this narrative, which he says in his preface attracted him by its \u201cgreat simplicity\u201d: \u201cIt is one, regular, and uniform, not charged with a multiplicity of incidents, and yet affording several revolutions of fortune; by which the passions may be excited, varied, and driven to their full tumult of emotion.\u201d The passions here are love and honor, the staples of Restoration and early-18th-century tragedy, sauced with militant patriotism, suitable for the author of Britannia. As might be expected from Thomson\u2019s description of his play, the conflicts are more emotional and moral than political, and he tries to make the group of characters embody these conflicts rather than to depict people with complex motives. Sophonisba presents not individuals but a system, the proper working of which generates a measure of disaster and a measure of triumph. In this it partly resembles The Seasons.\nThe action of the play consists of a series of dialogues: Sophonisba and her confidante Phoenissa; Masinissa and his confidante Narva; Masinissa and Sophonisba\u2019s vanquished, vengeful husband Syphax; Masinissa and Sophonisba; Sophonisba and Syphax; Masinissa and Scipio\u2019s lieutenant Lelius; Masinissa and Scipio\u2014all have one or more dialogues in which each presents at least (and at most) a partially valid position in opposition to the other. Each of the main characters is compelled to a position that he or she also, in some respects, freely chooses. Masinissa alone has two such positions, the \u201cRoman\u201d and the lover\u2019s, that put him in a double bind, where each course of action has its powerful virtues and grave faults. Double-bind tragedy, which developed with those still-current favorites Dryden and Thomas Otway, suited an ethically passionate and interrogative mode of thought widespread in the 18th century. It also involved, from the 1670s on, a complicating of gender roles, with the hero torn between more \u201cmasculine\u201d and softer, more \u201cfeminine\u201d values. Perhaps George Lillo\u2019s tragedy The London Merchant, performed the year after Sophonisba, draws from this complication its fullest potential, but Thomson\u2019s play comes close. While Masinissa melts, Queen Sophonisba herself, far more militant a patriot than in Livy, thinks of love as a mere strategy for furthering the goals of Carthage. Her splendor is in being manly, as Masinissa\u2019s tragedy and the source of one\u2019s sympathy for him, is in his emotional androgyny.\nBefore Thomson gave the world Britannia and Sophonisba, he had published Spring in June 1728, dedicating it to Lady Hertford. Now two years later, in June 1730, Autumn appeared, first in a handsome one-guinea subscription edition of the entire Seasons, together with \u201cA Hymn on the Seasons\u201d and the lines on Newton. The previously published poems on seasons were revised, especially Winter, in which Thomson nearly doubled the 405 lines of the first edition, and the volume was fitted with handsome plates drawn by the most important artist and designer of the day, William Kent. The dazzling list of subscribers, beginning with the queen and members of the peerage and including fellow writers such as Pope, Ramsay, William Somervile, John Arbuthnot, and Edward Young, indicates Thomson\u2019s stature as he approached the age of 30. Keeping this intellectually and socially posh company had already affected the shape of The Seasons; so did the style of life into which Thomson now glided. With the sale of over 450 copies of this subscription edition, and the sale of his copyrights (from which he had been profiting quite amply) to his publishers, John Millan and Andrew Millar, he found himself nearly well-to-do. But, since he was feckless, he needed every shilling and in future years was to revise and enlarge The Seasons over and over in some measure for that reason. As he did so, he moved further from the sharp focus with which he had begun in 1726. Thomson progressively opened his poem to different poetic modes\u2014the tale, homily, satire, poeticized science\u2014so as to encompass the diverse voices that saturated the natural world of which he wrote. The four serial poems now presented a vast, mingled array of scenes, reflections, narratives, descriptions, and panegyrics. In its original form, Winter had among other things spoken to the experience of Thomson the emigr\u00e9 Scot; The Seasons spoke from the vantage of a modern Briton who knew the order and variety of the world through science, travel, and moral observation\u2014a modern Briton was a cosmopolitan.\nSome critics of The Seasons have drawn a post-Wordsworthian line between Thomson\u2019s fine, fresh depictions of nature and what they see as his woolly, worn homilies to man. As his poem went from version to version, their argument goes, he kept swathing and muffling the real merits of The Seasons, in these pieties. Two issues are in play here, one of execution, the other of plan. As to execution, the critics may be right. Thomson\u2019s greatest talents lay in natural description, not moral comment, and the assured nods and amens for his moral observations may well have allowed him to be slipshod in working out his verse for them. During the 18th century, morality in verse could aim for elegance, if moral sensibility was supposed to be an effect of a refined and civilized spirit, or it could aim for a simple immediacy if it was to strike a universal chord in the human breast; but neither of these styles exercised much discipline over the poet. Thomson, therefore, does less well with common places than with material where novelty, a specific imaginative vision, or an aphoristic energy prodded him to give precise shape to his lines. Besides, the vividness and evocative strength that distinguish much of The Seasons gave the homilies hard competition, made harder when later readers are supercilious about the homiletic mode itself.\nAs to the plan of The Seasons, however, opening his poem to greater diversity surely formed part of a design akin to the one that underlay his elegy for Newton: a weaving together of truth, goodness, and beauty. The spatiotemporal world, imaged in the seasons, needed to be caught in a total mimesis, reflecting and reflected upon from the viewpoints Thomson might assume; or at least such a mimesis had to be successfully evoked. Whereas Newton himself could present nature in a regularized form, plotted out by the laws of physics, Thomson had to make do with a crowd of distracting particulars. No wonder he kept revising, and no wonder, too, that he produced some incoherences. Some earlier descriptive poems, such as John Denham\u2019s Cooper\u2019s Hill (1642) or Pope\u2019s Windsor-Forest (1713), had fitted together nicely in accord with a scheme of discordia concors, a harmony of heterogeneity. More than his predecessors, though, Thomson had to accommodate another complication\u2014point of view. In The Seasons he had to bring together at least three incompatible, legitimate, and necessary perspectives: a sense of human beings as mere creatures within nature, of humans as moral and experiential centers within nature, and of human readers reflecting upon nature, including its human population. For this fidelity to nature as variously experienced, Thomson surrendered the sort of unity he achieved in the 1726 Winter, or he deferred it to an underlying divine order outside experience and to a conceptual or verbal order, the totalizing that the general term \u201cSpring\u201d or \u201cSummer\u201d implies. Different readers would have these orders in mind to different degrees when moving through the absorbing descriptions, sharp contrasts, and digressions of The Seasons, so that the interplay between a reader\u2019s sense of order and sense of untamable profusion becomes another significant effect in the poem. As Thomson lengthened The Seasons, the forest floor of profusion intertwined even more densely over the underlying order, so that he no doubt felt increasing need to proclaim how ordered his world was and how special the human condition within it.\nThe ultimate unifying truth of The Seasons, guarantor of beauty and goodness, was God\u2019s, such as could be intuited or named but known only as ground for all phenomena. The truths that testified to it were those of evoked experience, of course, but also those of science. From the regularity of scientific processes, Thomson could depict a nature of rich, indicative particulars that did not crumble into randomness or mere density. He could also place his readers as among a race of beings who were wise enough to rise above particulars precisely by passing through them, by observing them with a close eye. This double virtue for science\u2014as witness to God\u2019s legible plan and as mediatrix between that plan and valuable, experienced details\u2014Thomson drew from the mass of writing known as physicotheology, which stressed the wonderful fitness and economy of the natural world. Thus, for instance, in Spring he hails the \u201cSource of Being! Universal Soul / Of Heaven and Earth! Essential Presence ... !\u201d whose \u201cmaster-hand\u201d makes plants nourish themselves; and in Summer he sings of the Sun, \u201cin whom best seen shines out thy Maker,\u201d for \u201c\u2019Tis by thy secret, strong, attractive force\u201d that the solar \u201csystem rolls entire\u2014from the far bourne / Of utmost Saturn ... to Mercury.\u201d Other passages deal with insects, the percolation of subterranean waters, and the creation of fogs\u2014all these, and some briefer references, betoken nature\u2019s complexity and yet ideal legibility to someone who loves the world intellectually as well as emotionally. They remind the 20th-century reader how thin much post-Thomsonian descriptive poetry was to become, limited to elaborating only two of Thomson\u2019s effects, verbal photography and reflection of the writer\u2019s own mind. There has been another loss, too, for the scientific passages can hardly strike one today as they did Thomson\u2019s audience, who knew gravitation, plant respiration, and microscopy as recent discoveries, not as a historical facts but as part of a new, surprising dominion of the mind. While Thomson would have thought\u2014wrongly\u2014of his homiletic passages as universal, free of history, he surely did mean in his scientific passages to allude to the historical momentum that his own age had given to finding the \u201ctimeless\u201d truths of nature. Therefore, his Latinate diction not only harked back to his poetic ancestors, it drew from the language of the new science, so marking his readers both as heirs of the old philosophic poets, Lucretius or Virgil, and as voyagers in an age of nonclassical discovery, a British order of nature and humankind that transcended the Roman.\nThe blank verse of The Seasons is somewhat grander than that of the 1726 Winter: though Thomson continues to draw on dramatic and Miltonic blank verse, he refers more insistently to Virgil\u2019s Georgics, the last major classical poem to make the worlds of experienced nature and scientifically understood nature mesh. The example of the Georgics, language aside, surely prompted Thomson to produce as comprehensive, artfully disordered, and closely mimetic a poem as The Seasons, once the early Winter had started him presenting humans within a demanding, splendid nature. Scots education paid more homage to Latin than did English, and among Latin poems, the Georgics had a special place of honor, as what Addison called \u201cthe most complete, elaborate, and finished piece of all antiquity\u201d (\u201cEssay on Virgil\u2019s Georgics,\u201d 1697). Its vividness of description was thought to be such that, as Addison said, \u201cwe receive more strong and lively ideas of things from his words, than we could have done from the objects themselves.\u201d In addition, its majesty and grace of language ennobled the commonplace, allowing Virgil to move easily from the details of husbandry to moral precept, historical interlude, images of the natural order, and evocation of Roman majesty. Thomson\u2019s aims closely resembled those he saw modeled by Virgil, whose high rural patriotism and quick sense of the interchange between humans and nature generally inspired The Seasons and from whose work Thomson adapted or even, at times, paraphrased passages directly. In its language, then, The Seasons keeps returning to Latinate words, often ones with scientific force (\u201csublimed,\u201d \u201cconvolved,\u201d \u201cefflux,\u201d \u201cinfracted,\u201d \u201covarious,\u201d \u201cflexile,\u201d \u201cconcoctive,\u201d and \u201cconstringent,\u201d for example), or, rarely, their etymological force (\u201cthe spreading beech, that o\u2019er the stream / Incumbent hung\u201d). Thomson also showed a fondness for compound words (such as \u201chollow-blustering,\u201d \u201cnew-creating,\u201d \u201cmute-imploring,\u201d and \u201cplume-dark\u201d) after the fashion of Latin (\u201cres publica,\u201d \u201cpaterfamilias,\u201d \u201cignicolor,\u201d and \u201cceleripes\u201d). Latinate usages are also Miltonic, so that one might speculate that Thomson perhaps took the relation of the Georgics and the Aeneid in Latin as a model for that of his own poem, The Seasons, to Paradise Lost in English. However that may be, as the ambition and the lexicon of The Seasons make the Latin usages allude to Milton, the form, scope, and subject of the poem make them allude to Virgil. One need not particularize further, for like several of his contemporaries, Thomson strives for a texture of broadly unified allusiveness that serves as a sign of emulation, an homage, an appropriation, and a going beyond.\nThomson placed The Seasons carefully, then, within poetic and cultural traditions, and located the objects he depicts within a variety of perspectives. In these concerns he resembled his contemporaries, as indeed he did in his moment-by-moment treatment of objects in his verse. Some lines from Autumn serve as an example:\n\u00a0\nHence from the busy joy-resounding fields,\nIn cheerful error let us tread the maze\nOf Autumn unconfined; and taste, revived,\nThe breath of orchard big with bending fruit.\nObedient to the breeze and beating ray,\nFrom the deep-loaded bough a mellow shower\nIncessant melts away. The juicy pear\nLies in a soft profusion scattered round.\nA various sweetness swells the gentle race,\nBy Nature\u2019s all-refining hand prepared,\nOf tempered sun, and water, earth, and air,\nIn ever-changing compositions mixed.\nSuch, falling frequent through the chiller night,\nThe fragrant stores, the wide-projected heaps\nOf apples, which the lusty-handed year\nInnumerous o\u2019er the blushing orchard shakes.\n\u00a0\nIn these lines are the compound words and terms used in Latin rather than English senses (\u201cerror\u201d instead of \u201cwandering,\u201d \u201cwide-projected\u201d meaning \u201cthrown\u201d); here is science, in the four elements of the \u201cever-changing composition\u201d; here is also closely worked order, not only in Thomson\u2019s exquisite sense of sound, which a reading aloud will reveal, but also in the placement of objects. One moves from the openness of the field to a \u201cmaze\u201d minus its usual negative connotation of baffled confinement, since instead one is \u201crevived\u201d along the mazy path one chooses among the trees in an orchard, while the notion of revival is emphasized by the personification and pregnancy of the orchard. The curvilinear movement of \u201cerror\u201d now turns into the \u201cbig\u201dness and \u201cbending\u201d of the boughs, the fully ripe \u201cjuicy pear,\u201d and the sweetness that \u201cswells\u201d the gentle race. The \u201cbreeze\u201d (air), \u201cbeating ray\u201d (sun / fire), water imagery in \u201cshower\u201d and \u201cmelts,\u201d and the earth on which the \u201csoft profusion\u201d of fruit lies are to reappear a few lines later as the \u201cever-changing composition.\u201d Thomson then steps back\u2014with the comment about Nature\u2019s hand\u2014from the sunny afternoon and juxtaposes it with the \u201cchiller night\u201d when apples fall; but, of course, both times offer delight and profusion (pears \u201cscattered round\u201d and \u201cwide-projected heaps\u201d of apples), just as the busy fields and the mazy orchard both offer joy. The leitmotif here, after all, is the ideal of cooperative compounding\u2014difference as forms of the same\u2014expressed in the mixing of the four elements. As this passage ends, the image of pregnancy returns when \u201cthe lusty-handed year\u201d makes the orchard blush, responding to his shaken-down gifts but also simply red with apples. By such intertwining of analogy and contrast, Thomson constructs The Seasons, not as a unified poem but as a continuous experience.\nContinuity on the level of the reading consciousness, a pointing toward a divine totality that one can suppose and believe in, and yet, between these wholes, only an unruly, fractured, and polyvalent world, represented by a succession of vivid, contrasting, and yet often analogous fragments\u2014those are the forms of The Seasons. Thomson found much to do each time he came to revise a poem the texture of which required such delicate, meticulous adjustments for continuity while the length and sequence of episodes remained so open. The public rewarded him well: in the 50 years after his death some 170 different editions of his Works or The Seasons appeared, including translations into French, German, and Dutch.\nIn early November 1730 Thomson set out for a tour of the continent as companion to Charles Richard Talbot, the 21-year-old son and heir of Solicitor-General Charles Talbot. The elder Talbot allotted Thomson two hundred pounds per annum, which must have been paid in 1731 and 1732, while the two travelers remained on the foreign side of the Channel. \u201cTravelling,\u201d Thomson wrote to Dodington in October 1730, before setting off, \u201chas long been my fondest wish. ... The storing one\u2019s imagination with ideas of all-beautiful, all-great, and all-perfect Nature: these are the pure Materia Poetica, the light and colours, with which fancy kindles up her whole creation, paints a sentiment, and even embodies an abstracted thought. I long to see the fields where Virgil gathered his immortal honey, and tread the same ground where men have thought and acted so greatly.\u201d When he actually trod alien soil as a sturdy Briton, however, Thomson found the Virgilian fields bare of their mellifluous clover, and the grounds of past greatness overgrown with gorse. \u201cThat Enthusiasm I had upon me with regard to travelling goes off, I find, very fast,\u201d he informed Dodington from Rome a year later. In accord with the longstanding view that Italy was so badly governed, so priest-ridden, as he wrote to Dodington, that \u201chuman Arts and Industry\u201d were nearly \u201cextirpated\u201d and \u201cNature herself\u2019 disfigured, he planned the first part of his long poem Liberty (1735\u20131736), moved by the evocative sight of Roman ruins. Because of his patriotism, his zeal for commerce, his successful Roman play (Sophonisba), his moral warmth, and his devotion to the pleasures of the imagination, he may also have seen himself as a successor to Addison, whose familiar poem A Letter from Italy (1704) and lengthy Remarks on Several Parts of Italy (1705) he drew upon quite heavily. Eventually Liberty was to have five parts, about 3,400 lines in all, on which Thomson worked for two years after his return to England in January 1733: these were published over a little more than a year (January 1735\u2013February 1736). But just as Europe disappointed him, so his European poem was to do. Liberty was Thomson\u2019s first critical failure: Millar had 3,000 plainpaper copies of Part I printed, but only 2,000 of Parts II and III, and a mere 1,000 of Parts IV and V.\nLiberty describes spatial and temporal denuding: land after land achieves magnificence through devotion to a republican ideal; land after land falls back into decay through selfishness, party politics, luxury, and despotism. In line with the dubious but widely believed principle that high culture flourishes most, if not exclusively, in free lands, the sojourns and flights of Liberty, here personified, also mark the points in history where the arts prospered or fell into ruin. Like Britannia, Liberty was an opposition poem, and its claim to state a universal principle of culture over a wide variety of nations represents opposition ideology, the rendering \u201cnatural\u201d of a historically local set of nationalistic notions. The militancy of Britannia embodies part of this set, specified through British naval power and commerce: this is the language of empire, not (yet) for conquest at any cost but surely for peaceful conquest through the extension of trade. Liberty embodies another two parts of the set. First it presents an ideal of the state as a res publica, a single and entire center of commitment. The rejected extremes here for Thomson are Continental despotism, in which the state is the king\u2019s instead of belonging to all citizens, and Walpole\u2019s individualism, in which the state is an arena for self-interest. Second, the poem presents a double lineage for Britain. One is a spiritualized version of the actual, in which monarchs succeed each other but in which freedom progresses, and the other is an actualized version of the spiritual, in which the ideal of liberty moves from one home to another till it settles, provisionally, in the Britain of the present day. Both the republican ideal and the double history erect in Britain a communal object of immeasurable value, thus magnifying any threat to it, thus justifying the union (in 1707) of England and Scotland, and thus interlocking the political and economic systems of free men and free merchants. The last section of Liberty depicts the arts and public works alike embellishing this happy land.\nObviously, though Thomson couches the poem as a dramatic narration of things seen, he himself did not see the events he narrates, and as a result Liberty is dense with borrowings from ancient and modern sources. Through these borrowings and the dramatic narration, Thomson tries to give the poem a context of authority, thence urgency. 18th-century poets, of course, implicitly accepted a weak idea of intertextuality, that any poem is a weave of previous texts, although equally they placed far more weight on the writer\u2019s intentions than would late 20th-century intertextual theorists. Thomson not only uses plain statements to make his intentions evident, he also invokes previous texts to attest to his opinions, and so he footnotes some claims. To show that the arts, exemplified by his own poem, traverse the same path as the movement of liberty, he reenacts these parallel movements with a double mimesis: the speech of Liberty, made in the 1730s, represents millennia of history; the poetry of Thomson, also made in the 1730s, merges history\u2019s realm of truth with the poet\u2019s realm of beauty and virtue. He wanted, finally, to bring the experiences of nations and ages into contemporary Britain, an appropriative commerce in ideas that Britain carries on by right. With the narrative voice of Liberty, Thomson hoped to give the poem the vividness that comes from personal witness, to justify his tropes with the suggestion that they arose from personal feeling, and to efface any impression of jingoism by making his speaker immune to mere national loyalties.\nIn doing all this, he had no more than mixed success. Samuel Johnson,\u00a0writing his biography of Thomson for The Lives of the Poets 40 years later, acidly remarks, \u201cAt this time a long course of opposition to Sir Robert Walpole had filled the nation with clamours for liberty, of which no man felt the want, and with care for liberty, which was not in danger.\u201d Yet, says Johnson, the poem remained unread, \u201ccondemned to harbour spiders, and to gather dust,\u201d and for a good reason, since \u201cthe recurrence of the same images must tire in time; an enumeration of examples to prove a position which nobody denied, as it was from the beginning superfluous, must quickly grow disgusting.\u201d Common experience shows, however, that people love to be told eloquently what they already know, and a fortiori so, one would think, for a populace who raise a cry for liberty even when (in Johnson\u2019s eyes) it was unendangered and ample. More likely than Johnson\u2019s reason is that Liberty did not meet the expectations of those whom The Seasons had delighted. As Liberty swept through time, gathering dialectic speed, it offered little scope for Thomson\u2019s great descriptive powers. At such spots as he can exercise these, one realizes how much they have been missed, as in Part IV when \u201cthe snow-fed Torrent, in white Mazes tost\u201d falls \u201cto the clear Aetherial Lake below,\u201d while \u201chigh o\u2019ertopping all the broken Scene\u201d appears \u201cThe Mountain fading into Sky; where shines / On Winter Winter shivering, and whose Top / Licks from their cloudy Magazine the Snows.\u201d Much more often, Liberty is simply oratorical, well done in a style that would have brought some minor writer into a recognized place in literary history but that disappoints when coming from Thomson.\nThomson\u2019s idea of British liberty took party politics, luxury, and lust for personal gain as threats; and fresh from writing the dramatic verse of his poem, he turned once more to the theater, to show how self-interest defeats self-sacrificial public spirit. His new play was the tragedy Agamemnon, first performed in April 1738, with the reigning tragedian of the time, James Quin, in the title role and an excellent supporting cast. Thomson\u2019s version of the story reworks the structures of Sophonisba. Agamemnon himself takes on the moral positions of Masinissa and Scipio, in that virtue and (fallible) wisdom beam from him as king, that he loves deeply (Clytemnestra and Iphigeneia), but that he puts the public good before his own affections. Thus he has, for honor and duty\u2019s sake, spent 10 years far from his beloved wife and has allowed his daughter to be sacrificed, an act that his other daughter, Electra, does not hold against him. The weakness and vacillation of Masinissa till the end here belong to Clytemnestra, guilt-racked for her adultery with Egisthus, rancorous about the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, and stung with jealousy over Agamemnon\u2019s supposed affair (he is wholly pure in this play) with Cassandra. Sophonisba, dedicated to Queen Caroline, depicted a patriot queen, but now a patriot king was in order, with the death of Caroline (an ally of Walpole\u2019s to the last) and the intensification of party politics around the figures of George II, the Prince of Wales, and the menacing prime minister. Thomson exhibits an Egisthus as spiteful and ill willed as Syphax, far stronger than Aeschylus\u2019s Aegisthus, and fit to stand in for the Patriots\u2019 archvillain, Walpole. This murderous underling in Agamemnon was a model of the \u201cstatesman\u201d or wicked deputy, such as would in the political climate of the 1730s have been applied to Walpole even if Egisthus had not exiled the wise advisor Melisander in Thomson\u2019s play, just as Walpole had kept Bolingbroke, the opposition\u2019s \u00e9minence grise, in French exile for 10 years. Pope, in May 1738 (the next month), was able to use \u201cAegysthus\u201d as a name for Walpole in Epilogue to the Satires ... Dialogue I.\nDespite its Greek setting, Agamemnon fits the subgenre of the \u201cRoman play,\u201d in which an admirable protagonist embodies virtue and patriotism, quelling personal desires in favor of serving his country\u2019s needs. The loftier the figure, the greater his benevolence in this intensified version of noblesse oblige. Some of Dryden\u2019s tragedies hint at this subgenre, and, as mentioned, Addison\u2019s Cato represents it fully. Still, Roman plays did not really thrive on the London stage till the opposition to Walpole grew in the 1730s. As in Cato, which also became more popular, the message of Agamemnon is intensified by the spectacle of its patriot king dead. He is a victim of his own rectitude, for Thomson\u2019s Agamemnon has to die partly to prevent his planned seizure of the villainous Egisthus: \u201cThe sleep of death alone shall seal these eyes,\u201d he proclaims, \u201cWhile such a wretch holds power in my dominions.\u201d In this death, however, lies a serious weakness for Thomson\u2019s play. Unlike Cato, who commits suicide as he speaks noble soliloquies, Agamemnon could not very well die on stage\u2014one cannot brave one\u2019s killer from one\u2019s bath\u2014and the fact of his offstage murder could not keep the audience in suspense, since they knew the story in advance. As a result, the tension and tragedy mount as the patriot king\u2019s death impends, while Agamemnon himself stays unseen, unheard. The weight of the last two acts must therefore be borne largely by Clytemnestra, the most conflicted and psychologically most interesting (that is, least \u201cRoman\u201d) of the characters, whose part Thomson wrote to good effect for the tragedienne Mary Porter. But this was to focus upon the politically least telling figure while making the patriot king wholly ineffective. Perhaps this misfiring explains why, star cast and all, Agamemnon played only nine times, twice at the command of the opposition\u2019s darling, the Prince of Wales, and then dropped from sight, never to return to the London stage in the 18th century. Its excellence as a reading tragedy, however, led Millar to be able to sell 4,500 copies of it.\nThe mid 1730s were years of change and consolidation in Thomson\u2019s life. In late 1733 he had lost his traveling companion Talbot to death, and he had gained a sinecure from the young man\u2019s father, for when the elder Talbot was made lord chancellor he appointed Thomson as secretary of the briefs. (When Thomson lost the post in 1737\u2014at Lord Talbot\u2019s death the chancellorship passed to Lord Hardwicke, an ally of Walpole\u2019s\u2014the Prince of Wales fully indemnified him with a pension of one hundred pounds a year.) After having lived for 10 years in London or abroad, Thomson moved in 1736 from his old lodgings just off the Strand and took a cottage in Richmond, then a village about eight miles as the crow flies, a good bit longer as the roads ran, from Hyde Park Corner. This distance and his fear of horses gave glee to his two wig makers, for as the assistant of one later recalled (in William Hone\u2019s Table Book, 1827), \u201can excellent customer he was to both\u201d: Thomson had \u201ca dozen [wigs] at a time, ... and all of them so big that nobody else could wear them. I suppose his sweating to such a degree made him have so many; for I have known him spoil a new one only in walking from London,\u201d something he did \u201cat all hours in the night.\u201d Despite the expense and bother, Thomson must have relished life in the near country, for in 1739 he moved to a larger cottage in Richmond, with seven rooms and a kitchen, where a housekeeper attended to his needs and he charitably attended to the needs of two nephews, whom he had employed as gardeners.\nLacking his own family, Thomson at Richmond gave himself over to a full social life, eating, drinking, and talking a great deal. His friend Andrew Mitchell told Boswell in 1764 (as reported in Boswell\u2019s Journal) \u201cthat notwithstanding of his fine imitation of Ovid on the Pythagorean system [of metempsychosis, in Spring], he was an egregious gormandizer of beefsteaks.\u201d As to his drinking, Lady Hertford, an early patron of Thomson\u2019s, wrote in 1742, that \u201cHe turns Day into Night, & Night into Day & is (as I am told) never awake till after Midnight & I doubt [that is, I suspect] has quite drown\u2019d his Genius\u201d (in Thomson\u2019s Letters and Documents, edited by Alan Dugald McKillop, 1958). He grew fat from his plate and punch bowl, and stoop-shouldered from, perhaps, his habit of writing late at night, peering dimly at his work by candlelight. His easygoing, sentimental temperament and disreputable hours might account for tales of his indolence. This ease of temper left Thomson often without money, with which he was quite negligent and generous, but it left him, too, with a great many friends, including Pope and Quin among the English, and numerous Scots. No harsh stories about him have ever appeared.\n\u201cThomson used to sweat so much the first nights of his plays,\u201d said Mitchell, \u201cthat when he came and met his friends at a tavern in the [Covent Garden] Piazza, his wig was as if it had been dipped in an oil-pot.\u201d If so, his wig makers were disappointed in late March 1739 when the first night of Thomson\u2019s third tragedy, Edward and Eleonora, was cancelled by order of the lord chamberlain\u2019s office. Though this play is, by and large, politically innocuous, at least in its printed version, Thomson cannot have been amazed by the censorship. In January 1738, three months before Agamemnon with its Walpolean Egisthus, Thomson had responded to the Licensing Act for the stage (July 1737) by writing a preface to a new edition of Milton\u2019s Areopagitica (1644), and then having another of Milton\u2019s tracts, this time advocating war on Spain, printed together with his own Britannia. This second book appeared in the same month (March 1738) as Captain Robert Jenkins displayed his ear, severed by the Spanish, to Parliament, and the opposition was intensifying the cry for war. In February 1739 Thomson wrote the prologue to his friend Mallet\u2019s Mustapha in which an evil vizier and a vengeful queen slander a noble prince to his father, and so cause his death. Mustapha made the lord chamberlain\u2019s office deny a license a few weeks later to the next exercise in reading between the lines, Henry Brooke\u2019s Gustavus Vasa, or, The Deliverer of His Country (1739). Brooke, an Irish protege of Swift\u2019s, enjoyed through Pope the friendship of opposition leaders, just as Thomson did. In Gustavus Vasa, the patriot king-to-be must contend with an evil \u201cstatesman,\u201d Trollio, to free his land from foreign domination by Christiern; George II, of course, often spent time in his Hanoverian realm. Given the battle between Prince Frederick and his father, the battle between Vasa and the older Christiern, who calls him \u201cboy,\u201d may have seemed politically audacious, especially because it repeats the fatal conflict between father and son in Mustapha.\nBrooke\u2019s play was the first to be forbidden under the Licensing Act, Edward and Eleonora the second. Brooke had immediately arranged for Gustavus Vasa to be printed by subscription, found the staunch defenders of liberty and opposition ready to buy, and profited handsomely. He also supervised a production of the play in Dublin, under the taunting name The Patriot. As to the printing, Thomson followed suit, selling 1,000 fine royal copies of his play in addition to 3,500 in ordinary paper. If the subscribers longed for political red meat, they were disappointed to find a tale of wifely sacrifice and manly honor. Eleonora surrenders her own life to save that of her husband, the future King Edward I of England, from whose envenomed wound she sucks the poison; the pagan sultan, Selim, accused of sending the assassin who stabs Edward, risks his life to save his honor by bringing the antidote to the poison; all ends happily as spouses are reunited, Christian and pagan rest at peace, and Edward returns to England as king. In the play\u2019s discussion of the prince\u2019s ascent to the throne lay the censor\u2019s objections, since Edward\u2019s royal father (as seen in act 1) needs to be saved \u201cfrom his ministers, from those / Who hold him captive in the worst of chains,\u201d those \u201clow corrupt insinuating traitors\u201d who deny \u201cthe royal heir\u201d his just claim \u201cTo share his father\u2019s inmost heart and counsels\u201d while they \u201cmake / A property, a market of his honour.\u201d The death of Henry III, announced in act 4, again elicits comments about an English monarch \u201cabus\u2019d\u201d and \u201cdeluded\u201d by \u201csmiling traitors.\u201d Mostly, though, Edward and Eleonora depicts virtue, strives for pathos, and preaches religious tolerance. This last matter was not entirely free of politics, however, since the Barbary states (Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli) served as Britain\u2019s natural allies against Spain in the Mediterranean near Gibraltar.\nWhen Frederick, Prince of Wales\u2019s first child, Princess Augusta, had been born on August 1, 1737, Thomson had written an ode to the happy father, with expectable slurs on the \u201cselfish-Parties\u201d and \u201cdeep Corruption\u201d that eat at Britain\u2019s soul, and praise of \u201cthe promis\u2019d Glories of Thy Reign\u201d and Frederick\u2019s prospective offspring, new Edwards, Henrys, Annas, and Elizas. For the Princess\u2019s third birthday, Frederick planned a gala masque at his estate Cliefden, for which the opposition\u2019s favorite playwrights, Thomson and Mallet, were to produce a script, with music by Thomas Arne. Alfred (1740) ended with what has become the most often-heard piece of 18th-century British music or poetry, \u201cRule Britannia,\u201d written by Thomson, set to music by Arne, and sung by Thomas Lowe, who, said Charles Burney, had the finest tenor voice he had ever heard in his life. In 1735, the prince had erected a statue of King Alfred in his gardens in Pall Mall, to endorse the patriot version of history, which assigned Saxon origins to the ideal of the free commonwealth. Since Alfred had been so declared the founder of English liberties, the plot of Thomson and Mallet\u2019s masque again presented the patriot myth, in which the true and meritorious king (like Mallet\u2019s Mustapha, Brooks\u2019s Gustavus Vasa, and Thomson\u2019s Edward) waits to ascend the throne and right all wrongs. During the masque, King Alfred, briefly unseated by the Danes, whiles away his exile by watching a pageant of future British history, a lineage of virtue and freedom, before he receives news that a new battle has restored him. In keeping with the honor roll of monarchs to whom Thomson had paid homage three years earlier, the pageant presents an Edward and Eliza, Edward III and his son the Black Prince, together with Queen Philippa (since the Princess of Windsor was also to be honored), and Elizabeth I. Both these monarchs, Edward III and Elizabeth, had a special patriot status, as shown by the tribute they get in Bolingbroke\u2019s Remarks on the History of England (1754). Edward was \u201ca glorious king,\u201d \u201cfierce and terrible to his enemies [but] amiable and indulgent to his subjects,\u201d a man who \u201cloved ... the spirit of liberty in his people\u201d and quashed the ministers who had ruled his unhappy father. Elizabeth \u201cwas neither deceived, like [her predecessors], by her ministers; nor betrayed by her passions, to serve any other interest at the expence of England,\u201d so that \u201cshe was supported by the spirit of liberty; and she overcame that of faction.\u201d (The Scots Thomson and Mallet both had so deep an investment in this patriot myth, through which the British nation-state had for many centuries been freeing itself from absolutism, that both were willing to worship Elizabeth, no friend to Scotland, just as Thomson had glorified Edward I, Scotland\u2019s foe, in his last play.) The final monarch in the pageant of Alfred is William III, who dethroned a bad king. No wonder that, despite managerial plans, Alfred did not appear on the London stage till 1745.\nEdward and Eleonora and Alfred put forward the ideal of wedded love, the domestic expression of the social harmonies that Thomson preached. He himself had had no such bliss, unlike Mallet, who married his second wife in October 1742, only months after the death of his first. Shortly after that, Thomson fell in love with Elizabeth Young, the sister-in-law of his close friend James Robertson, a London neighbor who now was physician to the court at Kew. Thomson\u2019s first letter to Young, a quick, hard-headed Scot whose Border Scots burr must have resembled his own, dates from March 1743. He gets right to the point: \u201cWhat shall I say but that I love you, love you with the utmost Ardor, the most perfect Esteem, and inexpressible Tenderness. Imagination, Reason and the Heart, all conspire to love you.\u201d Unfortunately, the letter goes on with what look suspiciously like posturings, as Thomson addresses himself to Young\u2019s \u201cCompassion,\u201d imagines how he will hide in the country to \u201cindulge the melancholy Pleasure of continually musing on those Charms that have undone me,\u201d and moralizes that \u201csurely Nature is too just and benevolent to suffer a Passion like mine to be in vain, or to Purposes of Ruin.\u201d None of Young\u2019s letters survive, though she did not discourage Thomson actively, since he kept seeing her and writing to her; but one may assume that she kept her impecunious, awkward lover at some distance. He was a good bit older than she\u2014she was to marry the naval officer John Campbell, 20 years Thomson\u2019s junior\u2014and, set in his bachelor habits, he must have made her wary of what life with him would be like. Though this courtship continued for at least three years, he was never to marry. By late 1747, when George Lyttelton, another staunch patriot, proposed someone as a wife for Thomson, he replied in a letter by praising the lady\u2019s \u201cgood and worthy,\u201d \u201ccharming and piquant\u201d qualities, but sadly concluded: \u201cevery Man has a singular and uncontroulable Imagination of his own: now, as I told you before, She does not pique mine.\u201d Less than a year later, still a \u201cdifficult old Batchelor,\u201d he was dead.\nThomson\u2019s unrequited pursuit of Young may have contributed to the theme and tone of his next tragedy, Tancred and Sigismunda (1745), which he wrote in 1744, following his publication of a revised edition of The Seasons. With David Garrick and Susannah Gibber as the young lovers, the new play appeared on March 18, 1745 and ran nine nights; Millar printed 5,000 copies of the text and, this time, not because he counted on political fervor for sales. Walpole was no longer an issue: unhorsed as prime minister in 1742, he had become earl of Orford, giving up his seat in the Commons and with it, his power; coincidentally, on the first night of Tancred and Sigismunda, he died. The success of the play, rather, depended on Thomson\u2019s powers of eliciting pathos, for which he went back to the double-bind model of Sophonisba. Each character acts for the best in accord with his or her own understanding, and all end in disaster. In order to prevent civil war in Sicily, Matteo Siffredi forges a document by which Tancred, the rightful prince, agrees to ascend to the throne peacefully by marrying the rival pretender to it, Princess Constantia. Siffredi also urges his daughter Sigismunda, Tancred\u2019s betrothed, to marry the chief of Constantia\u2019s faction, Osmond; horrified by the forged agreement that she mistakes for Tancred\u2019s betrayal, she obeys her father. Tancred himself can do nothing\u2014enraged over Siffredi\u2019s trick and yet unable to revenge himself on his beloved\u2019s father; passionately in love with Sigismunda and yet denied her; trained to be a man of action and yet seeing himself a pawn of his own father\u2019s will (he can have the throne only if he marries Constantia), of Siffredi\u2019s judgment, and of his royal position, which requires him to keep the peace. In this predicament he comes to Osmond\u2019s home to protest his love for Sigismunda, kills Osmond when attacked by him, and witnesses Sigismunda\u2019s death at the sword of her dying husband, who hopes to protect his honor. This play, with its endogenous logic, focused action, and highly motivated plot comes the closest of any of Thomson\u2019s plays to the simplicity and inexorability of Jean Racine\u2019s, a writer he particularly admired. All Thomson\u2019s tragedies give evidence of great abilities, but not always wisely used; they are never better used than in Tancred and Sigismunda.\nThough enriched by the success of this play and given some financial ease in 1744 by receiving another sinecure, this time via Lyttelton, Thomson found himself less able to enjoy his old life, maybe in the wake of his failed romance. He spent a good deal of time with Lyttelton, probably resisting that evangelical lord\u2019s urging to become a practicing Christian. A new tragedy, Coriolanus (1749), was finished by early 1747, but was kept from the Covent Garden stage by Garrick\u2019s refusal to play a supporting role to his rival Quin; or, as Thomson put it in a letter of April 1748 to William Paterson, \u201cCoriolanus has not yet appeared upon the Stage, from the little dirty Jealousy of Tullus\u2014I mean of him who was desired to act Tullus, towards him who alone can act Coriolanus.\u201d The part of Tullus, by far the more psychologically intriguing of the two, would perfectly have suited the lively, \u201crealistic\u201d acting style of Garrick, while Quin, with his majestic and ornate tragic manner, was ideal for Coriolanus. Since Tullus is gnawed by envy of Coriolanus, whom eventually he kills so as to assure his own preeminence, Garrick\u2019s decision probably kept the audience from gossiping about the play as an allegory of theatrical politics: Quin was appearing less and Garrick more while the two were at the same house. Coriolanus was not played until January 1749, when Garrick had left for the management of Drury Lane and Thomson had died. Performances served as a benefit for the poet\u2019s sisters, Jean Thomson and Mary Thomson Craig.\nThomson\u2019s Coriolanus\u2014following Livy rather than Plutarch, William Shakespeare\u2019s source\u2014is no more an adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s than Thomson\u2019s Sophonisba is of Lee\u2019s or his Agamemnon is of Aeschylus\u2019s. Pared down to a simple action, in a more Racinian than Shakespearean manner, this tragedy passes over the battles within Rome between plebeians and patricians and the subterfuges by which Rome was drawn into war\u2014political issues that would have piqued Thomson\u2019s interest in his patriot days. His play instead focuses on the last day of the noble-minded but somewhat overweening Coriolanus. When expelled from Rome, in act 1, for his fiery denunciation of the tribunes, \u201ca victim yielded/by her weak nobles to the madd\u2019ning rabble,\u201d he seeks out his old Volscian foe, Tullus. Tullus joyfully grants him half the Volscian command, but then finds himself outdone by the newcomer who by nature dominates the scene. The pride that led Tullus to his magnanimity, \u201cto see my rival-warrior / ... bend his soul / ... to sue for my protection,\u201d now (in act 4) leads him to repent it, and at the same time to recognize his self-deceit, as \u201cdown I plunge, betray\u2019d even by my virtue, / From gulph to gulph, from shame to deeper shame.\u201d Tullus\u2019s disillusionment with himself leads him to hate Coriolanus, its cause, still more. The play ends with Tullus\u2019s henchmen stabbing Coriolanus and the killers being led off to face \u201ca full council of the states at Antium.\u201d Paradoxically, the two great generals suffer from the same vice, a subjection of patriotism to self-interest: Coriolanus, as the closing homily of the play announces, should not have \u201crais\u2019d his vengeful arm against his country,\u201d and Tullus should not have sacrificed even a renegade on the altar of his own ego. Since in 1745 and 1746 many of Thomson\u2019s fellow Scots had rebelled with the Young Pretender and been savagely butchered by the English general, the duke of Cumberland, the treatment of these two Roman warriors must have imposed an exceptionally delicate task upon Thomson; he carried it off faultlessly.\nCoriolanus complements its predecessor, Tancred and Sigismunda, another play in which the self and society are set opposite one another. In Tancred and Sigismunda, love is the victim of what one might call social honor, not internalized but understood as an inexorable and estranging burden handed down by the fathers who arrange the \u201cwise\u201d political matches. In Coriolanus honor is the victim of a self-love that proves deeper than the love and honor it takes as masks. Now that the war fever of the late 1730s had abated, too, Thomson could give the clearest, least selfish voices to those of peace, reminding one that sublimated pride and envy, which mark the successful warrior in the form of glorious and noble emulation, are necessary but treacherous virtues. They turn magnanimity into a form of rationalized retreat, altruism into a self-annulment, command into a habit of domination. As in some of the earlier plays, like Tancred and Sigismunda, Thomson pitches his moral battleground less between virtues and vices than between varieties of the ethically defensible, or at least the ethically respected.\nSimilar conflicts reappear in The Castle of Indolence (1748), wherein the active life routs contemplative inaction. In form The Castle differs strikingly from anything he had published before. This Spenserian imitation had been hatching since Thomson\u2019s return from the grand tour in the early 1730s. As he settled into his comfortable life, he wrote stanzas mocking himself and his friends. Since at the time he was enlarging on Britain as a great and ancient nation-state in the Miltonic poem Liberty, he plausibly adapted another father of British verse for this teasing verse. Thomson was at first aiming for a kind of mock-heroic, what the poet William Julius Mickle was to call \u201cthe ludicrous of which the antique phraseology and manner of Spenser are so happily and peculiarly susceptible\u201d (introduction to Sir Martyn, 1767). Nonetheless, the idiom of The Faerie Queene also led Thomson to imbue The Castle with strong moral and allegorical force, especially given Liberty\u2019s censure of idle luxury. Thomson\u2019s lazy friends appear in The Castle as victims of a wizard whose malign enchantments make them still more passive than their predilections had. Beneath them in their indolent retreat lies a \u201cdark Den\u201d that harbors half-dead Lethargy, \u201cSoft-swoln and pale\u201d Hydropsy, moping Hypochondria, Gout, and Apoplexy. In the second canto, the Knight of Arts and Industry, son of Selvaggio and Dame Poverty, repeats the journey that Liberty had taken in Thomson\u2019s earlier poem: he passes through the once-golden nations, more recently gray, \u201cto slavish Sloth and Tyranny a Prey,\u201d except of course for Britain. Called from retirement like a British Cincinnatus, the Knight disenchants the Castle and frees its denizens. The preachier and more militant parts of The Castle, like comparable episodes in The Faerie Queene, tend to sit less well with modern readers than parts that rely for their effect on complexity rather than righteousness, but for Thomson the lack of complexity, the simplicity of truth, itself effected a moral understanding.\nAs with much of Thomson\u2019s earlier work, the fault line between virtue and vice here divides republican from individualist principles. Rural retirement, soft arts, imagination, and convivial distractions are true goods when they can be turned to aid the community, but tainted goods when, as in the Castle, the \u201cOne great Rule for All\u201d is \u201cThat each should work his own Desire,\u201d when \u201cevery Man [has] stroll\u2019d off his own glad Way.\u201d The enclosed castle acts as a metaphor for the \u201cindolent\u201d state of easy, friendly alienation, where real pleasure levitates over an unseen chasm, here allegorized as the \u201cdark Den\u201d of solitary, self-absorbed illness at the end of the first canto. The castle dwellers \u201ceat, drink, study, sleep, ... melt the Time in Love, or wake the Lyre\u201d as they choose, while the world appears only reflected or imagined, therefore only as the stuff of poetic reverie or a satire on vanity. Of course these views of the world are right, friendship and ease and pleasure are right, though inadequate, and Thomson presents them at their most appealing. Those whom he affectionately portrays as inhabiting the castle, his companions, are also appealing. Because indolence sequesters the poets, the satirist, the bon vivant, and the great actor from their proper field, the res publica; however, the castle dwellers take these right ideas and behaviors as fully sufficient, in which they are self-deceived. The individualist ethic, for Thomson, cuts people off from themselves and from the possible scope of their understanding as well as from their society. Hence that ethic \u201cdull[s] the Sense\u201d of private as well as public virtue.\nPart of the brilliance behind Thomson\u2019s use of Spenser, then, is his thereby casting his poem in a doubly communitarian mode, first that of allegory, with its responsibility to an order that lies outside the poem itself, and second that of British history, of which the modern but often archaized language keeps reminding one. The stylistic temporality of The Castle of Indolence itself shows up the sham a temporality of Indolence\u2019s castle. In the narration of the first canto Thomson mostly lets his hybrid style run in counterpoint to effects of suspended time, such as the pastoral setting of the castle, the Epicurean \u201cSyren Melody,\u201d of Indolence himself, and descriptions of habitual action. Through masterful use of sound and \u201cromantic\u201d imagery, he plays on the visionary quality in Spenser and brings one into real time only\u2014and then obliquely\u2014with the satire and the genial depictions \u00e0 clef starting in stanza 49.\nCanto 2, though, represents time in the life history of the Knight and in a portrait of modern British liberty, a once \u201cgreat Plan\u201d rapidly fragmenting into personal license: \u201cMind, mind yourselves! Why should the vulgar Man, / The Lacquey be more virtuous than his Lord?\u201d The Knight sets off to the castle with the bard Philomelus, a \u201cDruid-Wight\u201d whose name relates him to the nightingale, hence to nature, but who, as Joseph Warton claimed, probably represents Thomson\u2019s great patriot ally Pope, who had died in 1744. Playing his \u201cBritish Harp,\u201d the bard sings of history and temporal processes, thus converting \u201cthe better Sort\u201d of person. The balky, on the other hand, stubbornly doting on \u201cthe harmless Sabbath of [their] Time,\u201d end up driven by Beggary and Scorn in \u201ca ceaseless Round\u201d like swine goaded without rest or mercy through the filthy market town of 18th-century Brentford. Thomson devotes the first canto, then, to the calm inhabitants of the castle who gaze amusedly at a representation of restless worldlings \u201cbustling to and for with foolish Haste, / In search of Pleasures vain.\u201d He devotes the second to reinterpreting this image for the gazers themselves, as time takes over from their delusory dream.\nTime took over too fast for Thomson in 1748. The first edition of The Castle of Indolence appeared in early May 1748 and the second edition in late September. In between these dates, at four in the morning of August 27 Thomson died, quite unexpectedly, of what his friend and fellow poet Dr. John Armstrong called a \u201clow nervous malignant\u201d fever. Thomson\u2019s death, Armstrong went on (in a letter to Murdoch), \u201cmakes a hideous gap; and the loss of such an agreeable Friend turns some of the sweetest scenes in England into a something waste and desolate.\u201d Thomson appears to have died without enemies, was mourned widely, and, through William Collins\u2019s superb \u201cOde Occasioned by the Death of Mr. Thomson\u201d (1749), given a tribute comparable to his own art. One cannot say the same for the attentions of his friend Lyttelton. Having striven during Thomson\u2019s life to convert him to Christianity, Lyttelton strove after Thomson\u2019s death to convert his poetry to decorum, and so produced a liberally revised and generally ignored version of Thomson\u2019s work in 1750. An edition of what Thomson himself wrote appeared in 1762, edited by Murdoch, one of the friends teased in The Castle of Indolence. In the same year a monument to Thomson was erected next to Shakespeare\u2019s in Westminster Abbey. His sculptured attributes are a laurel wreath, a tragic mask, an ancient harp, a book, and the cap of Liberty\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["Scotland"], "School/Period:": ["Augustan"]}}
