After his parents separated, the poet moved with his mother to Lisbon and then Coimbra. Influenced by surrealist thought, ancient Greek poetry, and Japanese haiku, Andrade wrote spare, concrete, lyric poems celebrating the body and the natural world with elemental precision.  \u00a0 \u201c[I]n Eug\u00e9nio\u2019s poetry, more than any other I can think of, the sound is the sense,\u201d noted translator Alexis Levitin in his introduction to Forbidden Words: The Selected Poems of Eug\u00e9nio de Andrade (2003). Levitin concluded, \u201cThe heart of his genius is woven into the delicate, minutely wrought balance of sound in his words.\u201d Levitin has brought more than ten of Andrade\u2019s numerous collections into English, including Inhabited Heart: The Selected Poems of Eug\u00e9nio de Andrade (1985), White on White (1987), and Solar Matter: Mat\u00e9ria Solar (1995). Andrade, whose work has been translated into more than a dozen languages, published more than 20 volumes of poetry during his lifetime, including his debut collection, Narcisco (or Narcissus, 1940), and Poesia, Terra de Minha M\u00e3e (1992), a collaboration with the photographer D\u00e1rio Gon\u00e7alves. Andrade also translated the poetry of Sappho, Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, and Yannis Ritsos into Portuguese. \u00a0 A member of the Acad\u00e9mie Mallarm\u00e9 in Paris, Andrade received the European Prize for Poetry, the Cam\u00f5es Prize, and France\u2019s Prix Jean Malrieu. He worked as an inspector for the Ministry of Health in Oporto from 1950 to 1983. For the last 15 years of his life, he lived in an apartment within the Foundation of Eug\u00e9nio de Andrade, which currently hosts several annual literary events and seminars honoring the poet\u2019s work.\n", "attrs": {}}
