Natural Facts was described by Rae Armantrout as \"a\u00a0beautiful and scary book. The speech of the past and the serrated\u00a0present flies out like debris from some great explosion. Neilson\u00a0presents us with dazzling conundrums. This book is made of eerie\u00a0harmonies and wrenched homilies.\" In the online journal How2 \"ecopoetics feature,\" poet/editor Harriet Tarlo praises Neilson's play\u00a0on \"classificatory language exploding its elevated, somewhat sinister\u00a0sibilance throughout ... even as she mocks its pomposity and assumption\u00a0of linguistic power.\" Robert Fitterman notes Neilson was one \"of a\u00a0handful of poets, mostly women, working in radical appropriation in\u00a0the mid-1990's. These poets (Doris, Spahr, Ngai, Rosenfield, Grim,\u00a0Neilson, Morrison, Goldman and others) were taking their lead from\u00a0Appropriation Art of the 1980s and a new wave of feminist theory. It\u00a0was a distinctive shift from collage poetry because the appropriated\u00a0source material was fore-fronted in new, unexpected ways.\" \u00a0Neilson's\u00a0poetry has been anthologized and published in journals internationally\u00a0since 1985. She edited and co-founded the journal Big Allis, in New\u00a0York City with poet Jessica Grim. Big Allis generated a dynamic forum\u00a0for contemporary writing by emerging and established experimentalpoets with a specific focus on innovative poetry by women.Neilson lives in\u00a0Brooklyn, New York.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {}}
