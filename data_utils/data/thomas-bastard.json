The fellowship was retracted on charges of libel in 1601, after Bastard was suspected of authoring the anonymous tract An Admonition to the City of Oxford, or Marprelates Basterdine, which noted the sexual misdeeds of well-known members of the community.  \u00a0 Bastard\u2019s poetry collection, Chrestoleros: Seven Books of Epigrames (1598), contains almost 300 of his epigrams. These brief poems, ranging in length from two to 16 lines, are primarily concerned with the events and people of his time and balance lively satire against bitter reflections of poverty. Bastard also published the three-volume Magna Britannia: A Latin Poem (1605). \u00a0 Bastard served as a chaplain and vicar for the Church of England and in 1615 published two collections of tracts: Five Sermons and Twelve Sermons. After a mental breakdown, he died at the age of 52 in debtor\u2019s prison in Dorchester and was buried in a churchyard there. \ufeff\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"], "School/Period:": ["Renaissance"]}}
