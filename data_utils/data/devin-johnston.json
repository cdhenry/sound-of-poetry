He\u00a0is the author of several collections of poetry, including Far-Fetched\u00a0(2015),\u00a0Sources (2008), a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, Aversions (2004), and Telepathy (2001). His prose writing includes the critical study Precipitations: Contemporary American Poetry as Occult Practice (2002) and Creaturely and Other Essays (2009). A former poetry editor for the Chicago Review from 1995-2000, Johnston co-founded\u00a0and co-edits\u00a0Flood Editions with Michael O\u2019Leary.\n\r\nA lyric poet influenced by Yeats, Johnston whittles the lines of his poems, compressing imagery that is at once allusive and immediate. \u201cWhile his lexicon is rich and particular, Johnston's line is severe, unadorned, and keenly cut to measure out the subtle, counter-pointed music which so strongly marks these poems,\u201d observes poet Forrest Gander of the poems in Telepathy.\n\r\nHe lives in St. Louis and teaches at Saint Louis University.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
