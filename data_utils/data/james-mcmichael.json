Describing his invented form of varied stanza and line lengths in an interview with Mark Dow for AGNI Online, McMichael stated, \u201cIn The World at Large the form is a one-, two-, three- and four-line stanza. Capacity adds a five-line stanza to the mix. No one of the five stanzas is repeated until each of the other four appears. The form\u2019s like Schoenberg\u2019s 12-tone system, in which no one note recurs until all the others have been heard from. \u2026 I like to think the stanzaic form is consistent with how varied the length of the line is. \u2026 The line can make its way onto the page as a single syllable or maybe as many as up to fourteen. Once the variety in terms of line-length is established, it can be sustained effectively only if the phrasing is made to fit with it in such a way that each line is exactly the length that it needs to be.\u201d In a 2006 Boston Globe article on that year\u2019s National Book Award finalists, including McMichael\u2019s Capacity, Liz Rosenberg wrote, \u201cMcMichael writes densely; his language is compacted, coiled, sprung (in Hopkins's sense) and highly allusive.\u201d \u00a0 McMichael is the author of several poetry collections, including Four Good Things (1980), The World at Large: New and Selected Poems (1996), and National Book Award finalist Capacity (2006). His prose includes The Style of the Short Poem (1967) and a volume on James Joyce, Ulysses and Justice (1991).  \u00a0 McMichael\u2019s honors include fellowships from the Academy of American Poets and the Guggenheim Foundation as well as a Whiting Foundation Writer\u2019s Award, the Eunice Tietjens Memorial Prize, the Academy of Arts and Letters Arthur O. Rense Prize, and the Poetry Society of America Shelley Memorial Prize. McMichael is a professor at the University of California at Irvine.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Western"]}}
