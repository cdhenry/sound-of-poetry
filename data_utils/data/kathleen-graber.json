She earned a BA in philosophy at New York University, and in 1994, after years of teaching high school English, Graber was inspired while leading a class field trip to the Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival to begin writing poems. She subsequently earned an MFA at New York University. \u00a0 Graber\u2019s poems engage themes of grief, yearning, and the intersection of mental and geographical landscapes. Notes a reviewer for Publishers Weekly, \u201c[W]hat makes Graber\u2019s poems so fresh and wild are the associative slips that happen between the distant past and the urgent present.\u201d In a 2007 interview for Kicking Wind, Graber states, \u201cI do believe poetry changes the world: it changes the world by changing the way we think about the world.\u201d \u00a0 Graber is the author of The Eternal City (2010), chosen for the Princeton Series of Contemporary Poets and a finalist for the National Book Award, and Correspondence (2006), winner of the Saturnalia Books Poetry Prize and a finalist for the National Poetry Series. \u00a0 Graber\u2019s honors include a Rona Jaffe Writer\u2019s Award, an Artist Fellowship from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, a Hodder Fellowship in Creative Writing at Princeton University, and an Amy Lowell Poetry Travelling Scholarship. \u00a0 She has taught at New York University and Virginia Commonwealth University.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Mid-Atlantic"]}}
