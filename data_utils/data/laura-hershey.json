Recognized as a leader in the movement for disability rights, Hershey was the author of Survival Strategies for Going Abroad: A Guide for People with Disabilities (Mobility International USA, 2005), wrote a regular blog \u201cLife Support\u201d for the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation\u2019s website, and published over 100 essays and articles in magazines, journals, anthologies, and websites. Her poems appeared in anthologies including Pushing the Limits: Disabled Dykes Produce Culture (Women\u2019s Press, 1996), Bigger Than the Sky: Disabled Women on Parenting (Women\u2019s Press, 1999), Fire in the Soul: 100 Poems for Human Rights (New Internationalist, 2009), as well as numerous literary journals and magazines. Hershey\u2019s poetry chapbook, Spark Before Dark (Finish Line Press, 2011), was published posthumously.\nHershey pursued justice issues on several fronts, drawing attention to and exploring the intersections of \u201cdisability and sexuality, gender, race, class, gender identity and more,\u201d according to activist Jessica Lehman: \u201cThrough her powerful, loving and thought-provoking words,\u201d Lehman continued, \u201cshe changed the way many of us think and helped us explore and develop new ideas.\u201d In addition to organizing for disability rights organizations such as ADAPT and Not Dead Yet, Hershey protested Jerry Lewis\u2019s muscular dystrophy campaigns, advocated for queer expression and activist poetries, and attended United Nations conferences on women\u2019s rights.\nLaura Hershey: On the Life and Work of an American Master (Pleiades Press, 2019) was edited by Meg Day and Niki Herd. The collection highlights the various modes through which Hershey engaged with disability, identity, and social justice. In an interview with Noah Roush, Day remarked that \u201cwhen Hershey writes\u2014powerfully, yes, and lyrically, narratively, politically\u2014she\u2019s modeling a kind of activism that still hasn\u2019t been fully realized by contemporary disabled poets and writers. Can we write poems that exit the nondisabled orbit, that tend crip linguistics and don\u2019t apologize or explain? Hershey\u2019s showing us how.\u201d\nHershey was the recipient of a Lambda Literary fellowship. After Hershey\u2019s death following an unexpected illness in 2010, her partner Robin Stephens told the Denver Post, \u201cShe was a genius who lived with disability and lived well.\u201d\n", "attrs": {}}
