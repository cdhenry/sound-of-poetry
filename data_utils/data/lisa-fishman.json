She earned a BA at Michigan State University, where she studied with Diane Wakoski and an MFA at Western Michigan University.\r\n\u00a0\r\nInfluenced by the British Romantic poets and the pastoral tradition, Fishman composes haunting poems that explore the movement of mind and memory. She is the author of several poetry collections, including Dear, Read (2002), The Happiness Experiment (2007), and Current (2010), and 24 Pages and Other Poems (2015). A Publishers Weekly review of The Happiness Experiment noted, \u201cNothing in Fishman\u2019s laconic earlier books would have predicted the dreamy, impressive exuberance in this, her third: the poet depicts her rural surroundings, their precedents in classical pastoral, and her own, generously drift-prone imagination in these lyrical sequences, exploring attachments geographic, georgic, erotic and maternal.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\r\nFishman has taught at Beloit College and Columbia College Chicago.\n", "attrs": {"Region:": ["U.S., Midwestern"]}}
