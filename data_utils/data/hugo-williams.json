He worked at London Magazine from 1961 to 1970 and has also edited poetry for the New Statesman. \u00a0 Williams\u2019s poems engage themes of personal memory, childhood, and sexuality with a plainspoken yet wry voice. In an interview with The Guardian, Williams discussed the autobiographical element of his work, stating, \u201cYou really can't start if you're not going to be completely honest. You have to use everything you know.\u2026 [Y]ou do sometimes enter into a sort of doublethink: \u2018They won't like it, but they might like it more if it\u2019s well done.\u2019\u201d \u00a0 Williams is the author of more than a dozen collections of poetry, including West End Final (2009), Collected Poems (2002), Billy\u2019s Rain (1999), which won the T.S. Eliot Prize, Selected Poems (1989), and his Eric Gregory Award\u2013winning debut, Symptoms of Loss (1965). A selection of his freelance writing appears in the essay collection Freelancing: Adventures of a Poet (1995). His additional honors include the Queen\u2019s Gold Medal for Poetry, the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize, and the Cholmondeley Award. \u00a0 A columnist for the Times Literary Supplement, Williams lives in London.\n                                                            ", "attrs": {"Region:": ["England"]}}
